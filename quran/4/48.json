But He forgives other than, save, that, of sins, to whomever He wills, forgiveness for, by admitting him into Paradise without punishment. And whomever He wills of the believers He punishes for their sins, and then admits them into Paradise. Whoever associates anything with God, then he has indeed invented a tremendous, a great, sin.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Lo! Allah forgiveth not that a partner should be ascribed unto Him) if one dies in such a state. He forgiveth (all) save that to whom He will) to whomever repents.
