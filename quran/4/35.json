The two arbiters do their best and bid the one guilty of the injustice to desist, or they suggest separation if they see fit. God, exalted be He, says, if they, the two arbiters, desire to set things right, God will grant them, the married couple, success, determining for them what constitutes [an act of] obedience, be it reconciliation or separation.

(If they) the arbiters (desire amendment) between the man and the woman, (Allah will make them of one mind) i.e. the arbiters, the man and the woman. (Lo! Allah is ever Knower) of the agreement and disagreement of the arbiters, (Aware) of the doing of the woman and the man. The verses from Allah's saying: (Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other...) to His saying: (If they desire amendment Allah will make them of one mind. Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Aware) were revealed about the daughter of Muhammad Ibn Salamah. Her husband, As'ad Ibn al-Rabi' had slapped her because she refused to sleep with him. Consequently, she went to the Prophet (pbuh) to seek retaliation against her husband, but Allah prohibited her from doing so.\n"
