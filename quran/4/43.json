It is said that the purpose [of this verse] is to prohibit the approach to places of prayer, that is, mosques, the exception being if one were merely passing through and not staying. But if you are sick, with an illness made worse by [contact with] water, or on a journey, that is, [or] travelling whilst you are [ritually] defiled or impure, or if any of you comes from the privy (al-gh\u0101\u2019it), a place designated for relieving nature, that is to say, [or if any of you] have defecated, or you have touched women (l\u0101mastum, a variant reading has lamastum: both mean lams, that is, \u2018touching with the hand\u2019, as stated by Ibn \u2018Umar; this is also the opinion of al-Sh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b, and it extends to touching with other parts of the skin; according to Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s, however, it is [referring to] sexual intercourse); and you can find no water, with which to purify yourselves for prayer, having made the effort to seek it out and search for it \u2014 the sick being exempt in this case \u2014 then resort to, seek, when the time [for the prayer] has commenced, wholesome soil, clean earth, strike it twice, and wipe your faces and your hands, with it, up to the elbows (the verb masaha, \u2018to wipe\u2019, may stand on its own with a direct object or take a particle [before the direct object, sc. masaha bi-]). God is ever Pardoning, Forgiving.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Allah revealed the following about the Companions of Muhammad prior to the prohibition of intoxicants: (0 ye who believe!) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (Draw not near unto prayer) in the Mosque of the Prophet (pbuh) with the Prophet (pbuh) (when ye are drunken, till ye know that which ye utter) so that you know what the prayer leader recites during the prayer, (nor when ye are polluted) nor when you are in a state of major ritual impurity, (save when journeying upon the road) except when passing through when you have to, (till ye have bathed) to purify yourselves from major ritual impurity. (And if ye be ill) wounded, (or on a journey, or one of you cometh from the closet, or ye have touched women) made love to them, (and ye find not water, then go to high clean soil and rub your faces) with the first clap (and your hands (therewith)) with the second clap. (Lo! Allah is Benign) Allah is Generous for the abundance He has given you, (Forgiving) of any shortcoming that may ensue from you.\n"
