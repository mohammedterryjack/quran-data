So the lightning-bolt struck them down for their wrongdoing. Then they adopted the Calf after the Clear Signs had come to them, but We pardoned them for that and gave Musa clear authority.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "The people of the Book demand of you to bring for them a book from heaven. But of Moses they had asked a bigger thing, and demanded: \"Show us God face to face.\" They were struck by lightning then as punishment for their wickedness. Even then they made the calf, when clear signs had reached them. Still We forgave them and gave Moses clear authority.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "The People of the Book now ask of you to have a Book come down on them from heaven; indeed they asked of Moses even greater things than this, for they said: 'Make us see Allah with our own eyes' - whereupon the thunderbolt suddenly smote them for their wickedness. Then they took to worshipping the calf after clear signs had come to them. Still, We forgave them, and conferred a manifest commandment upon Moses,\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "(Muhammad), the People of the Book ask you to make a Book descend to them from the heavens. However, they had asked Moses for things much harder to do than this, by saying, \"Show us God in person.\" Thunder and lightning struck them because of their unjust demands. Despite all the evidence that had come to them, they started to worship the calf, but We forgave them for their sins and gave Moses clear authority.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "O dear Prophet (Mohammed \u2013 peace and blessings be upon him) the People given the Book(s) ask you, to cause a Book to be sent down on them from heaven \u2013 so they had asked something even greater from Moosa, for they said, \u201cShow Allah to us, clearly\u201d \u2013 so the thunder seized them on account of their sins; then they chose the calf (for worship) after clear signs had come to them, then We forgave this; and We bestowed Moosa with a clear dominance.\n",

If you consider this shocking, then [know that], they, their forefathers, asked Moses for something greater than that, for they said, \u2018Show us God openly\u2019, before our eyes; so the thunderbolt, death, seized them, as punishment for them, for their evildoing, when they harassed him [Moses] with this demand. They then took to themselves the [golden] calf, for a god, after clear proofs, the miracles testifying to God\u2019s Oneness, had come to them; yet We pardoned that, and did not annihilate them; and We bestowed upon Moses clear authority, evident and manifest sway over them, for when he commanded them to slay themselves in repentance, they obeyed him.\n",

(They asked a greater thing of Moses aforetime) greater than what they have asked you, (for they said: Show us Allah plainly) such that they could see Him with their own eyes. (The storm of lightning seized them) the Fire burnt them (for their wickedness) for their rejection of Moses and their boldness vis-a-vis Allah. (Then (even after that) they chose the calf) they worshipped the calf (after clear proofs) commands and prohibitions (had come unto them. And We forgave them that!) We left them and did not exterminate them. (And We bestowed on Moses evident authority) evident proof: the staff and the white hand.\n"
