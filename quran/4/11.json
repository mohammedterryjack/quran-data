It is said that fawq, \u2018more than\u2019, introduces a relative clause; it is also said to guard against the wrong impression that the greater the number [of females] the greater the portion [they are entitled to], since, it is [mistakenly] thought that the entitlement of two females to twothirds derives from the fact that a female is entitled to one third when with a male; but if she, the daughter, be one (w\u0101hidatan, is also read w\u0101hidatun, making the k\u0101na [construction] syntactically complete) then to her a half; and to his parents, the deceased\u2019s, to each one of the two (li-kulli w\u0101hidin minhum\u0101, substitutes for the previous li-abawayhi, \u2018to his parents\u2019) the sixth of what he leaves, if he has a child, male or female: the point of the substitution is to show that they do not share the sixth [but receive one each]. [The term] \u2018child\u2019 (walad) also applies to a grandchild, and likewise \u2018parent\u2019 (abb) to a grandparent; but if he has no   child, and his heirs are his parents, alone or along with a spouse, then to his mother (read li-ummihi; also read, in both places [here and further down], li-immihi in order to avoid the cumbersome transition from a damma [\u2018u\u2019] to a kasra [\u2018I\u2019]) a third, of the property, or what remains after the spouse, the rest being for the father; or, if he has siblings, two or more, males or females, to his mother a sixth, and the rest for the father, and nothing for the siblings. The inheritance stipulated for those mentioned shall take place, after, the fulfilment of, any bequest that he may bequeath (read active y\u016bs\u012b, or passive y\u016bs\u0101), or, the repayment of, any debt, that he may owe. \u2018Bequest\u2019 comes before \u2018debt\u2019, even though it should only be fulfilled after the latter [has been repayed], to show that it should be taken seriously. Your parents and children (\u0101b\u0101\u2019ukum wa-abn\u0101\u2019ukum, is the subject, its predicate being [what follows]) \u2014 you know not which of them is nearer in benefit to you, in this world and the Hereafter. It may be that one supposes his son to be beneficial to him, leaves him an inheritance, and then it turns out that the father had been the more beneficial [of the two], and vice versa. The only One with knowledge of this [reality] is God, and for this reason He has prescribed for you inheritance: a prescription from God; surely God is ever Knowing, of His creation, Wise, in what He has ordained for them, that is to say, He is ever possessed of such attributes.\n",
