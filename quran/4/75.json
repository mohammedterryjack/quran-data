Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s, may God be pleased with him and his father, said, \u2018My mother and I were among them\u2019; who say, supplicating, \u2018O, our Lord, bring us forth from this town, Mecca, whose people are evildoers, through unbelief, and appoint for us a protector from You, to take charge of our affair, and appoint for us from You a helper\u2019, to defend us against them. God responded to their supplication and facilitated escape for some of them, while others remained behind until Mecca was conquered \u2014 in charge of them the Prophet (s) placed \u2018Att\u0101b b. As\u012bd, who proceeded to seek justice for the wronged from those that had wronged them.\n",

(Bring us forth from out this town) i.e. Mecca (of which the people are oppressors!) whose people are idolaters (Oh, give us from Thy presence) from You (some protecting friend!) a protector, meaning: 'Itab Ibn Usayd. (Oh, give us from Thy presence) from You (some defender!) who would prevent us from suffering. Allah answered their prayers and made the Prophet (pbuh) their defender and 'Itab their protecting friend. 94\n"
