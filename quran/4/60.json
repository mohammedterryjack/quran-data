Satan only wishes to lead them astray, far away.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "(O Messenger!) Have you not seen those who claim to believe in the Book which has been revealed to you and in the Books revealed before you, and yet desire to submit their disputes to the judgement of taghut (the Satanic authorities who decide independently of the Law of Allah), whereas they had been asked to reject it. And Satan seeks to make them drift far away from the right way.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "(Muhammad), have you seen those who think that they have faith in what is revealed to you and to others before you, yet choose to take their affairs to Satan for judgment even though they are commanded to deny him. Satan wants to lead them far away from the right path.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_6": "Have you not seen those who assert that they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you?

        "TRANSLATION_17": "[4:60] The following verse was revealed when a Jew and a hypocrite fell into a dispute. The hypocrite called on Ka\u2018b b. al-Ashraf, to arbitrate between them, while the Jew called on the Prophet (s). When they came to him, the Prophet ruled in favour of the Jew. But the hypocrite was not satisfied, and so they went before \u2018Umar. The Jew told him what had happened, whereupon he [\u2018Umar] turned to the hypocrite and asked him, \u2018Is this true?\u2019, and when he replied, \u2018Yes\u2019, he [\u2018Umar] killed him. Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been revealed to you, and what was revealed before you, desiring to take their disputes to a false deity (t\u0101gh\u016bt), one excessive in tempting [others] to falsehood (tughy\u0101n), namely, Ka\u2018b b. al-Ashraf, when they have been commanded to renounce him?, and not to associate with him. But Satan desires to mislead them, far astray, from the truth.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, Muhammad, about (those who pretend that they believe in that which is revealed unto thee) i.e. the Qur'an (and that which was revealed before thee) i.e. the Torah, (how they would go for judgement (in their disputes) to false deities) Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf (when they have been ordered) in the Qur'an (to abjure them?) to disavow them. (Satan would mislead them far astray) from the Truth and guidance. This verse was revealed about a hypocrite by the name of Bishr whom 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab had killed. This hypocrite had a dispute with a Jewish man.\n"
