Great have been the blessings of God on you.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "(O Messenger!) But for Allah's favour and mercy upon you, a party of them had resolved to mislead you, yet they only misled them selves, and could not have harmed you in any way.

(Allah revealeth unto thee the Scripture) He has sent you Gabriel with the Qur'an (and wisdom) expositing in it the lawful and the unlawful as well judicial decision (qada'), (and teacheth thee) by means of the Qur'an, legal rulings and legal punishments (that which thou knewest not) before the revelation of the Qur'an.
