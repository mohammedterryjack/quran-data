If only You would give us just a little You will not be wronged by so much as the smallest speck.'",

Why did you not allow us to live a little more?\" Say to them: \"How short-lived is the commerce of this world; but that of the next is best for those who fear God; and you will not be wronged the breadth of a thread.\"\n",
