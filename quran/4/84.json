        "TRANSLATION_17": "[4:84] So fight, O Muhammad (s), in the way of God; you are charged only with yourself, so do not be concerned with their failing to join you, the meaning being: fight, even if you are on your own, for you have been promised victory. And urge on the believers, incite them to fight and make them desire it; maybe God will restrain the might, the war, of the disbelievers; God is mightier, than them, and more severe in castigation, in punishment, than them. And so the Messenger of God (s) said: \u2018By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, I shall sally forth [to fight], even if [I go] alone\u2019. Thereupon, he sallied forth with seventy cavalrymen to the first [battle at] Badr, where God restrained the might of the disbelievers by casting terror into their hearts and preventing Ab\u016b Sufy\u0101n from sallying forth, as has already been mentioned in [s\u016brat] \u0100l \u2018Imr\u0101n [Q. 3:151].\n",

(Thou are not taxed) you are not commanded this (except for thyself and urge on the believers) to advance with you. (Peradventure Allah) peradventure when it is used in relation to Allah means that Allah will take it upon Himself (will restrain) will stop (the might) the fighting (of those who disbelieve) the unbelievers of Mecca. (Allah is stronger in might) in His torment (and stronger in inflicting punishment).\n"
