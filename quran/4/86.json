        "TRANSLATION_17": "[4:86] And when you are greeted with a greeting, as when it is said to you, \u2018Peace be upon you\u2019, greet, the one that greeted you, with better than it, by responding to him with, \u2018Peace be upon you, and God\u2019s mercy and blessings\u2019, or return it, by saying back to him what he said; in other words, it is a duty to greet in one of these two ways, the former being the preferred one. Surely God keeps count of, He holds [you] accountable for, all things, and requites accordingly, including things such as returning a greeting. The Sunna specifies that one should not return the greeting of an disbeliever, an innovator, a wicked person, and of the one that greets a person who is in the act of relieving himself, or one in the bath, or one eating \u2014 indeed it is actually disapproved with the exception of the last. To the disbeliever [who says \u2018peace be upon you\u2019] one should simply say, \u2018And upon you\u2019.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(When ye are greeted with a greeting) when someone greets you with a greeting, (greet ye with a better than it) this is for those of your Religion and belief by adding to the formula of greeting (or return it) or return the exact greeting, if the one who greets you happens to be of another religion. (Lo! Allah taketh count of all things) of greeting and the return of greetings, just as He is a witness and will reward all. This verse was revealed about a group of people who refrained from returning greetings.\n"
