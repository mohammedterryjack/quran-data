Although Allah addressed Muhammad (pbuh) here it was his people who were meant by it, (and whatever of ill) drought, dearth and high prices (befalleth thee it is from yourself) it is because of the purity of yourself, in that He purifies you because of it; it is also said that the above means: whatever good befalls you, such as conquest and booty, it is from Allah, as an honour from Allah; and whatever bad happens, such as killing and defeat as was the case at Uhud, is due to the transgression of your Companions when they left their positions. It is also said that this means: whatever good you do is because of Allah's given success and help; and whatever evil you commit is due to the transgression of your soul and His having forsaken you. (We have sent thee (Muhammad) as a messenger) to convey the message (unto mankind) to the jinn and human beings (and Allah is sufficient as witness) of that which they say: whatever good befalls them is from Allah and whatever evil befalls them is due to the ill-omen of Muhammad (pbuh) and his companions. It is also said that this means: Allah is sufficient as witness for their saying: bring a witness to testify that you are a messenger from Allah. 95\n"
