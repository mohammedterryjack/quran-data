Allah has given those who do jihad with their wealth and themselves a higher rank than those who stay behind. Allah has promised the Best to both, but Allah has preferred those who do jihad over those who stay behind by an immense reward:",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "The faithful who sit idle, other than those who are disabled, are not equal to those who fight in the way of God with their wealth and lives. God has exalted those in rank who fight for the faith with their wealth and souls over those who sit idle. Though God's promise of good is for all, He has granted His favour of the highest reward to those who struggle in preference to those who sit at home.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Those believers who sit at home, unless they do so out of a disabling injury, are not the equals of those who strive in the way of Allah with their possessions and their lives. Allah has exalted in rank those who strive with their possessions and their lives over those who sit at home; and though to each Allah has promised some good reward, He has preferred those who strive (in the way of Allah) over those who sit at home for a mighty reward.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Among the believers, those who stay at home without a good reason are not equal to those who strive for the cause of God in person or with their property. To those who strive for His cause in person or with their property, God has granted a higher rank than to those who stay at home.

        "TRANSLATION_5": "Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled, and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives.

        "TRANSLATION_6": "The holders back from among the believers, not having any injury, and those who strive hard in Allah's way with their property and their persons are not equal; Allah has made the strivers with their property and their persons to excel the holders back a (high) degree, and to each (class) Allah has promised good; and Allah shall grant to the strivers above the holders back a mighty reward:\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "Such believers as sit at home -- unless they have an injury -- are not the equals of those who struggle in the path of God with their possessions and their selves.

        "TRANSLATION_12": "Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their persons. Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at home).

        "TRANSLATION_14": "Believers who stay behind, having no injury, are not equal to those who fight in the way of Allah with their wealth and their souls.

God has preferred those who struggle with their possessions and their lives over the ones who sit at home, on account of some injury, by a degree, by [a degree of] merit, since both have the same intention, but the extra degree is given to those who have carried out the struggle; yet to each, of the two groups, God has promised the goodly reward, Paradise, and God has preferred those who struggle over the ones who sit at home, without any injury, with a great reward (ajran \u2018az\u012bman, is substituted by [the following, daraj\u0101tin minhu]),\n",

Allah hath conferred on those who strive with their wealth and lives a rank) a merit (above the sedentary) who do not have any disabling hurt. (Unto each) those who engage in jihad and those who do not (Allah hath promised good) Paradise due to their faith, (but He hath bestowed on those who strive) those who engage in jihad in his way (a great reward) an abundant reward in Paradise (above the sedentary) who do not have any disabling hurt;\n"
