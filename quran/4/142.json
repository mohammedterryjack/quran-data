When they stand up to pray, with the believers, they stand up lazily, reluctantly, and, for their prayers, to be seen by people, and they do not remember, pray [to], God save a little, for ostentation.\n",

(When they stand up to worship) when they go to perform the prayer (they perform it languidly) they perform it sluggishly (and to be seen of men) when they see people, they go to perform the prayer, but when they do see people they do not go, (and are mindful of Allah) they do not perform the prayer for Allah (but little) to show off and be known by others as people who pray;\n"
