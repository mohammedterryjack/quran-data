        "TRANSLATION_17": "[4:93] And whoever slays a believer deliberately, intending to kill him, with something that is lethal, aware of the fact that he [the slain] is a believer, his requital is Hell, abiding therein, and God is wroth with him and has cursed him, He has removed him from His mercy, and has prepared for him a mighty chastisement, in the Fire: this may be explained as [referring to] the person that deems such [killing] licit, or as being his requital if he were to be requited, but it would not be anything new if this threat [of punishment] were to be forgone, because of what He says: Other than that [that is, idolatry] He forgives whomever He will [Q. 4:48]. It is reported from Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s that it [the verse] should be understood as it stands, abrogating other verses of \u2018forgiveness\u2019. The verse in [s\u016brat] al-Baqara [Q. 2:178] clearly indicates that the one who kills deliberately should be killed in return, or if he is pardoned then he has to pay the blood-money, the value of which has already been mentioned. It is made clear in the Sunna that between the intentional and the unintentional, there is a type of killing that is identified as [being with] quasi-deliberate intent (shibh al\u2018amd), where the killer has slain with what in most cases is not [a] lethal [implement]. In such a case, there is no [right to] retaliation and blood-money is paid instead, so that it [this type of killing] is described as intentional, but [considered] unintentional in [that there applies] the fixing of the period [for payment] and the sharing of the burden [by the killer\u2019s clan]; in this [case] and that of intentional killing redemption is more urgent than in unintentional killing.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Then Allah revealed about Miqyas Ibn Sababah, the killer of al-Fihri, the emissary of Allah's Messenger (pbuh) who, after taking the blood money for the killing of his brother Hisham Ibn Sababah, left Islam and fled to Mecca, saying: (Whoso slayeth a believer of set purpose, his reward is hell) for this wilful killing (for ever) due to his idolatry. (Allah is wroth against him) for taking the blood money (and He hath cursed him) because he killed a person who did not kill his brother (and prepared for him an awful doom) because of his boldness towards Allah.\n"
