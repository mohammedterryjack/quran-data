Had God willed, to give them sway over you, He would have given them sway over you, by strengthening their hearts, so that assuredly they would have fought you: but God did not will it and so He cast terror into their hearts. And so if they stay away from you and do not fight you, and offer you peace, reconciliation, that is, [if] they submit, then God does not allow you any way against them, [He does not allow you] a means to take them captive or to slay them.\n",

(Had Allah willed He could have given them power over you) i.e. the people of Hilal Ibn 'Uwaymir (so that assuredly they would have fought you) together with their people upon the conquest of Mecca. (So, if they hold aloof from you and wage not war against you) upon the conquest of Mecca (and offer you peace) they submit to you through peace and honouring the pact they made, (Allah alloweth you no way against them) He does not give you any excuse for killing them.\n"
