        "TRANSLATION_17": "[4:16] And when two of you (read wa\u2019lladh\u0101ni or wa\u2019lladh\u0101nni) men, commit it, that is, a lewd act, adultery or homosexual intercourse, punish them both, with insults and beatings with sandals; but if they repent, of this [lewd act], and make amends, through [good] action, then leave them be, and do not harm them. God ever turns [relenting], to those who repent, and is Merciful, to them. This [verse] is abrogated by the prescribed punishment if adultery is meant [by the lewd act], and similarly if homosexual intercourse is meant, according to al-Sh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b; but according to him, the person who is the object of the [penetrative] act is not stoned, even if he be married; rather, he is flogged and banished. Judging by the dual person pronoun, it seems more obvious that homosexual fornication is meant [by this verse], even though the former [sc. alSh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b] was of the opinion that it referred to an adulterer and an adulteress; but this [opinion of his] may be countered by the fact that [the reference to] the two [men] becomes clear on account of the particle min being attached to a masculine pronoun [minkum, \u2018of you\u2019], and by the fact that they suffer the same punishment, [both effect the action of] repentance and [are both granted] that they be left alone [thereafter], [all of] which applies specifically to men, given that for women detention is stipulated, as was stated before.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And as for the two of you) of your free people, i.e. any unmarried man or woman (who are guilty thereof) who are guilty of adultery, (punish them both) by maligning and upbraiding them. (And if they repent) after this (and improve) in relation to that which is between them and Allah, (then let them be) refrain from maligning and upbraiding them. (Lo! Allah is Relenting) He overlooks sins, (Merciful). Maligning and upbraiding the unmarried person who commits adultery was later abrogated and replaced by one hundred lashes for both parties. 84\n"
