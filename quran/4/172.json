        "TRANSLATION_0": "The Messiah would never disdain to be a slave to Allah nor would the angels near to Him. If any do disdain to worship Him, and grow arrogant, He will in any case gather them all to Him.",

        "TRANSLATION_3": "Jesus never disdained the worship of God nor did the nearest angels to God. Whoever, out of pride, disdains the worship of God should know that everyone will be brought before Him.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "The Messiah does not at all hate being a bondman of Allah, and nor do the close angels; and whoever hates worshipping Him and is conceited \u2013 so very soon He will gather them all towards Him.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_9": "Surely, the Messiah would never disdain to be accounted a servant of God. Nor would the angels who are nearest to Him. If any do disdain to worship Him, and grow arrogant, He will in any case gather them all before Him.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "The Messiah disdaineth not that he should be a bondman of Allah, nor do the angels brought near. And whosoever disdaineth serving Him and stiff-necked, anon He shall gather them all unto Him.\n",

Whoever disdains to worship Him, and waxes proud, He will assuredly muster them to Him, all of them, in the Hereafter.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(The Messiah will never scorn to be a slave unto Allah) he will never not acknowledge his servitude to Allah. 109 This was revealed in respect of the Christians saying to the Prophet: \"0 Muhammad, what you say of Jesus is shameful\". Allah said to them: it is not shameful that Jesus be the servant of Allah, (nor will the favoured angels) nor would the favoured angels, the carriers of the Throne, ever not acknowledge that they are servants of Allah. (Whoso scorneth His service) whoever scorns to acknowledge that being his servant (and is proud) is too proud to believe in Allah, (all such) believers and unbelievers (will He assemble unto Him) on the Day of Judgement.\n"
