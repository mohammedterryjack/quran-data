Whoever does evil shall be requited for it, either in the Hereafter or in this life through trials and tribulations, as is stated in had\u012bth; and he will not find besides God, that is, other than Him, any friend, to protect him, or helper, to defend him against Him.\n",

(He who doeth wrong) evil (will have the recompense thereof) the believers will be recompensed in this world or after death before entering Paradise, and the unbelievers in the Hereafter before entering hell, (and will not find against Allah) against the torment of Allah (any protecting friend) any relative to benefit him (or helper) to save him from the torment.\n"
