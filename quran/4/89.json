If they do not, seize them wherever they are and do away with them. Do not make them your friends or allies,\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "They wish that you should disbelieve just as they disbelieved so that you may all be alike. Do not, therefore, take from them allies until they emigrate in the way of Allah, but if they turn their backs (on emigration), seize them and slay them wherever you come upon them. Take none of them for your ally or helper, This is the verdict on those hypocritical confessors of faith who belong to a belligerent, non-Muslim nation and actually participate in acts of hostility against the Islamic state.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "They wish you to become unbelievers as they themselves are. Do not establish friendship with them until they have abandoned their homes for the cause of God.
