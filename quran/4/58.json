Talha al-Hajab\u012b, by force, upon the arrival of the Prophet (s) in Mecca in the year of the Conquest, after he [\u2018Uthm\u0101n] had tried to prevent him [\u2018Al\u012b from taking it] saying, \u2018If I had known that he was the Messenger of God, I would not have prevented him\u2019. The Messenger of God (s) then ordered him [\u2018Al\u012b] to give it back to him [\u2018Uthm\u0101n] saying to him, \u2018Here you are, [it is yours] now and always\u2019. He [\u2018Uthm\u0101n] was amazed by this, whereupon \u2018Al\u012b recited to him this verse, and he accepted Islam. Upon his death, he [\u2018Uthm\u0101n] gave it [the key] to his brother, Shayba, and thus it remained in [the keep of] his descendants. Although the verse was revealed regarding a specific occasion, it holds true in general on account of the plural person [to which it is addressed]. And when you judge between people, He commands, that you judge with justice. Excellent is (ni\u2018imm\u0101, the m\u012bm of ni\u2018ima has been assimilated with the indefinite particle m\u0101, which is the object described, in other words, na\u2018ima shay\u2019an, \u2018an excellent thing [is]\u2019) the admonition God gives you, to restore a trust and to judge with justice. God is ever Hearer, of what is said, Seer, of what is done.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Regarding the key that the Prophet (pbuh) took from 'Uthman Ibn Talhah as a deposit, Allah commanded His Messenger to give back deposits to their owner, saying: (Lo! Allah commandeth you that ye restore deposits) to give back the key (to their owners) to 'Uthman Ibn Talhah, (and, if ye judge between mankind) between 'Uthman Ibn Talhah and 'Abbas Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, (that you judge justly) that you give back to 'Uthman and the providing of water (siqaya) to al-'Abbas. (Lo! comely is this which Allah admonisheth you) comely is this which Allah commands you, of giving back deposits to their owners and judging justly. (Lo! Allah is ever Hearer) when al-'Abbas said: Messenger of Allah! give me both the key and the providing of water, (Seer) of what 'Uthman Ibn Talhah did when he refused to give the key and said: By Allah's trust! Give me my right, Messenger of Allah!\n"
