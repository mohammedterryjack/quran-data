But they said, \u2018He only greeted us dissimulating, out of fear\u2019. So they killed him and took away his flock: O you who believe, when you are going forth, travelling in order to struggle, in the way of God, be discriminating (fa-tabayyan\u016b; a variant reading has fa-tathabbat\u016b, \u2018ascertain\u2019, here and further below); and do not say to him who offers you peace (read al-sal\u0101m or al-salam), that is, the greeting, or [offers you] submission, declaring the profession of faith (shah\u0101da), which is an indication of being a Muslim: \u2018You are not a believer: you are only saying this to dissimulate for fear of your life and property\u2019, so that you then end up killing him, desiring, seeking by this, the transient goods of the life of this world, that is, its enjoyment, in the way of spoils. With God are plenteous spoils, rendering you free of the need to kill such a person for his property. So you were formerly, when your lives and property were protected simply upon your professing the faith; but God has been gracious to you, making you known for your faith and uprightness. So be discriminating, lest you kill a believer and treat those entering the religion as you were treated [formerly]. Surely God is ever Aware of what you do, and will requite you for it.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Then Allah revealed about Usamah Ibn Zayd who killed Mirdas Ibn Nuhayk al-Farari, a fellow believer, saying: (0 ye who believe! When ye go forth (to fight) in the way of Allah) in jihad, (be careful to discriminate) between who is a believer and who is an unbeliever, (and say not unto one who offereth you peace) he who greets you and says to you \"there is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah\": (\"Thou art not a believer\";) and then kill him (seeking the chance profits of this life) so that you may despoil him. (With Allah are plenteous spoils) He has with Him a tremendous reward for him who avoids killing a fellow believer. (Even thus (as he now is) were ye before) with your people feeling safe with the believers and with Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions because of the attestation of \"there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah\", before the Emigration; (but Allah hath since then been gracious unto you) by migrating from the unbelievers. (Therefore take care to discriminate) such that you do not kill believers. (Allah is ever informed of what ye do) whether it is killing someone or other things.\n"
