If they had referred it, the news, to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, that is, the judicious elders among the Companions, in other words, if they had kept quiet about it until they were fully informed; those among them who are able to think it out, [those who] follow it up and seek knowledge of it, the ones who broadcast it, would have known it, and whether it is a matter that ought be broadcast or not, from them, from the Prophet (s) and those of authority. And but for the bounty of God to you, through Islam, and His mercy, to you through the Qur\u2019\u0101n, you would surely have followed Satan, in the abominations to which he commands you, except a few [of you].\n",

(If it had not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy) by means of His given success and protection (you would have followed Satan) all of you, (save a few (of you)) who would not divulge the news.\n"
