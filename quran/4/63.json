Allah knows the hypocrisy and antagonism in the hearts of those who built this counter mosque. (So oppose them) leave them and do not punish them this time (and admonish them) with your words so that they do not do it again, (and address them in plain terms about their souls) threaten them in an unequivocal way that you will punish them if they do it again.\n"
