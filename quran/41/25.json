        "TRANSLATION_1": "We had assigned to them close companions who made their past and present look attractive to them; and the fate that had once befallen the communities of jinns and men before them was justified upon them. They were indeed bound to perish.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "We had assigned to them companions who embellished for them all that was before them and behind them. Thus the same decree (of chastisement) which had overtaken the previous generations of jinn and human beings (also) became due against them. Surely they became the losers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "We assigned for them companions who would make their past and present (deeds) seem attractive to them. Thus, they became subject to what the jinn and human beings before were destined to suffer. They were certainly lost.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And We appointed companions for them, who made what is before them and what is after them seem good to them, and the Word proved true upon them along with the groups of jinns and men who passed away before them; they were indeed losers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "And We have assigned for them intimate companions (in this world), who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them.

Indeed they (all) were the losers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "And We have appointed for them comrades so they have made fair-seeming to them what is before them and what is behind them, and the word proved true against them-- among the nations of the jinn and the men that have passed away before them-- that they shall surely be losers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "We have allotted them comrades, and they have decked out fair to them that which is before them and behind them. So against them has been realized the Word concerning nations that passed away before them, men and jinn alike; surely they were losers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "And We assigned them comrades (in the world), who made their present and their past fairseeming unto them. And the Word concerning nations of the jinn and humankind who passed away before them hath effect for them. Lo! they were ever losers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "We assigned to them companions who made their doings appear fair to them. But the same decree [of punishment] proved true against them, which had proved true against nations of jinn and mankind who passed away before them. Surely they were the losers.\n",

And the Word (i.e. the torment) is justified against them as it was justified against those who were among the previous generations of jinns and men that had passed away before them. Indeed they (all) were the losers.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_15": "We had assigned companions for them, who glamorized to them what was in front of them, and what was behind them. And the Word proved true against them in communities of jinn and humans that have passed away before them. They were losers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "And We appointed for them companions who made attractive to them what was before them and what was behind them [of sin], and the word has come into effect upon them among nations which had passed on before them of jinn and men. Indeed, they [all] were losers.\n",

And the word, of chastisement \u2014 namely, the verse: Assuredly I will fill Hell \u2026 [Q. 11:119]) \u2014 became due against them, being among, all those, communities that passed away, [that] were destroyed, before them of jinn and mankind. Truly they were losers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And We assigned them comrades) helpers and partners among the satans, (who made their present and their past fair-seeming unto them) about the life of the world, they enticed them not to spend, making them believe that the life of the world will never perish or end; and regarding the matter of the Hereafter, they convinced them that there is no Paradise or hell, resurrection or reckoning. (And the Word) of chastisement (concerning nations of the jinn and humankind) of the disbelievers among the jinn and human beings (who passed away before them hath effect for them) has been ordained for them. (Verily they are the losers) in that they are punished.\n"
