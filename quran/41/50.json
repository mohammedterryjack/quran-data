And if am returned to my Lord, I will definitely find the best reward with Him.' But We will inform those who are kafir of what they did and make them suffer a ruthless punishment.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "If We give him a taste of Our favour after some distress he has known, he says: \"It was my due. I cannot imagine the Hour will come. And even if I go back to my Lord, there will surely still be the best for me with Him.\" We shall tell those who do not believe what they used to do, and inflict on them a heavy punishment.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "And if We bestow Our Mercy upon him after hardship, he will surely say: \u201cThis is what I truly deserve, and I do not believe that the Hour (of Resurrection) will ever come to pass; and if I am returned to my Lord, there too I shall enjoy the best.\u201d Surely We shall fully apprise the unbelievers of what they have done, and We shall certainly make them taste a severe chastisement.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "When We grant him mercy after his suffering, he (boldly) says, \"This is what I deserved. I do not think that there will ever be a Day of Judgment. Even if I will be returned to my Lord, I shall still deserve to receive better rewards from Him.\" We shall certainly tell the unbelievers about their deeds and cause them to suffer a severe punishment.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And if We make him taste Our mercy after the hardship which befell him, he will say, \u201cThis is mine! And I do not think that the Last Day will ever be established \u2013 and even if I am returned to my Lord, with Him is only goodness for me\u201d; so We shall indeed inform the disbelievers of what they did; and We shall indeed make them taste a solid punishment.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from Us, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say: \"This is due to my (merit); I think not that the Hour will be established. But if I am brought back to my Lord, surely there will be for me the best with Him. \"Then, We verily will show to the disbelievers what they have done, and We shall make them taste a severe torment.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "And if We make him taste mercy from Us after distress that has touched him, he would most certainly say: This is of me, and I do not think the hour will come to pass, and if I am sent back to my Lord, I shall have with Him sure good; but We will most certainly inform those who disbelieved of what they did, and We will most certainly make them taste of hard chastisement.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "And if We let him taste mercy from Us after hardship that has visited him, he surely says, 'This is mine; I think not the Hour is coming. If I am returned to my Lord, surely the reward most fair with Him will be mine.' Then We shall tell the unbelievers the things they have done, and assuredly We shall let them taste a harsh chastisement.\n",

And even if I am returned to my Lord, with Him there is for me the finest reward (Paradise)' Then, We shall tell the unbelievers what they did and let them taste a harsh punishment.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "And when We let him taste a mercy from Us, after the adversity that had afflicted him, he will say, \u201cThis is mine, and I do not think that the Hour is coming; and even if I am returned to my Lord, I will have the very best with Him.\u201d We will inform those who disbelieve of what they did, and We will make them taste an awful punishment.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "And if We let him taste mercy from Us after an adversity which has touched him, he will surely say, \"This is [due] to me, and I do not think the Hour will occur; and [even] if I should be returned to my Lord, indeed, for me there will be with Him the best.\" But We will surely inform those who disbelieved about what they did, and We will surely make them taste a massive punishment.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[41:50] And if (wa-la-in: the l\u0101m is for oaths) We let him taste, [if] We bestow on him, mercy, [such as] riches or good health, from Us after the harm, the hardship or tribulation, that had befallen him, he will surely say, \u2018This is my due!, in other words, [it is] on account of what I do. I do not think that the Hour will ever set in, and even if (wa-la-in: the l\u0101m is for oaths) I am returned to my Lord, I will indeed have the best [reward] with Him\u2019, namely, Paradise. But We will assuredly inform those who disbelieve of what they did, and assuredly We will make them taste a harsh chastisement (the l\u0101m [prefixed] in both verbs is that for oaths).\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And verily, if We cause him to taste mercy) through wealth and offspring (after some hurt that hath touched him) after being touched by some hardship, (he will say: This is my own) because of some goodness which Allah knows that I have in me; (and I deem not that the Hour will ever rise) as claimed by Muhammad (pbuh); thus denying the resurrection, (and if I am brought back to my Lord) as Muhammad (pbuh) says, (I surely shall be) in the Hereafter (better off with Him) I will enter Paradise; this is what 'Utbah Ibn Rabi'ah and his host said. (But We verily shall tell those who disbelieve (all) that they did) in their state of disbelief, (and We verily shall make them taste hard punishment) a severe punishment in hell: one sort of punishment after another.\n"
