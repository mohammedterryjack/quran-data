The Prophet (s), after this s\u016bra had been revealed, would frequently repeat the words subh\u0101na\u2019Ll\u0101hi wa bi-hamdihi, \u2018Glory and praise be to God\u2019, and astaghfiru\u2019Ll\u0101ha wa-at\u016bbu ilayhi, \u2018I seek forgiveness from God and I repent to Him\u2019; with [the revelation of] this [final s\u016bra] he realised that his end was near. The victory over Mecca was in Ramad\u0101n of year 8; the Prophet (s) passed away in Rab\u012b\u2018 I of the year 10. Meccan, consisting of 5 verses. When the Prophet (s) summoned his people and said, \u2018I am a warner to you, [standing] before a terrible chastisement\u2019, his uncle, Ab\u016b Lahab, said, \u2018May you perish! Is that what you have called us out for?\u2019, whereupon the following was revealed:\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Then hymn the praises of thy Lord) pray by the command of your Lord in gratitude for this, (and seek forgiveness of Him) from sins. (Lo! He is ever ready to show mercy) and forgiving. The Prophet (pbuh) was therefore informed in this surah that he was to die soon'. And of the surah in which Abu Lahab is mentioned, which is all Meccan and consists of 5 verses, 23 words and 77 letters: Surah 111: Palm Fibre (al-Masad) And of the surah in which Abu Lahab is mentioned, which is all Meccan and consists of 5 verses, 23 words and 77 letters:\n"
