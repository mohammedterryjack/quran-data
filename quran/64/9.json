(And whoso believeth in Allah) and in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and does right) sincerely between himself and his Lord, (He will remit from him his evil deeds) He will forgive his sins because of his belief in Allah's divine Oneness (and will bring him into Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers flow) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk flow, (therein to abide for ever) dwelling in Paradise never to die or leave it. (That is the Supreme Triumph) that is the supreme gain: they gained the Garden and are saved from the Fire.\n"
