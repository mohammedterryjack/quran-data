(mahy\u0101hum wamam\u0101tuhum, [this clause] constitutes the subject and a supplement; the sentence [itself] is a substitution for the k\u0101f [of ka\u2019lladh\u012bna, \u2018as those\u2019], and both [suffixed] pronouns [-hum] refer to the disbelievers). The meaning is: do they suppose that in the Hereafter We will assign them [a] good [fate] like believers, [that they will enjoy] a life of plenty, one equal to their life in this world, as when they said to the believers: \u2018Surely if we were to be resurrected, we will be given the same good things that you will be given!\u2019 God, exalted be He, says, in accordance with His denial [implicit] in the [rhetorical interrogative] hamza: How evil is that judgement which they make! In other words, it will not be so, for in the Hereafter they will be [suffering] in the chastisement, in contrast to their lives in this world; the believers, on the other hand, will be [delighting] in the Reward in the Hereafter because of their righteous deeds in this world, such as [their observance of] prayers, [their] alms-giving, fasting and otherwise (the m\u0101, \u2018that \u2026 which\u2019, relates to the verbal action, that is to say, ba\u2019isa hukman hukmuhum h\u0101dh\u0101, \u2018awful as a judgement is this judgement of theirs\u2019).\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Or do those who commit ill deeds) or do those who ascribes partners to Allah, i.e. 'Utbah and Shaybah and al-Walid Ibn 'Utbah who fought duals against 'AN, Hamzah and 'Ubaydah Ibn al-Harth on the Day of Badr, and who had said: \"If what Muhammad says about the Hereafter is true, then we will surely be better than them in the Hereafter, as we are better than them in the life of the world\". And so Allah said: or do they (suppose that We shall make them) that We shall make the disbelievers in terms of reward in the Hereafter (as those who believe) 'AN and his two fellow believers (and do good works) and do acts of obedience privately between themselves and their Lord, (the same life and death?) the life of the believer in his state of faith and his death in a state of faith cannot be the same as the life of the disbeliever who lives and dies in transgression and disbelief while Allah is angry with him. (Bad is their judgement) evil is that which they judge for themselves! 582\n"
