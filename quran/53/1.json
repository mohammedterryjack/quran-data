There was a 20 years interval between the first and last verses. When this verse was revealed, 'Utbah Ibn Abi Lahab heard that the Prophet (pbuh) swore by the revelation of the Qur'an in instalment and so he said: \"Tell Muhammad that I disbelieve in the instalments of the Qur'an\". When the Prophet (pbuh) was informed of this, he prayed: \"O Allah! Set on him one of Your wild beasts\". Later, Allah set on him a lion near Harran that snatched him from among his friends and took him to a place nearby. It tore him apart from head to foot but did not eat him because of his impurity, just as the Prophet (pbuh) had prayed against him. It is also said here Allah swore by the stars when they set, 620\n"
