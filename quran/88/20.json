As for His words sutihat, \u2018laid out flat\u2019, this on a literal reading suggests that the earth is flat, which is the opinion of most of the scholars of the [revealed] Law, and not a sphere as astronomers (ahl al-hay\u2019a) have it, even if this [latter] does not contradict any of the pillars of the Law.\n",
