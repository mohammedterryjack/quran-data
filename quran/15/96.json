Allah destroyed, in the span of one night and one day, each one of them by means of a different torment. These were five in number, among them was al-'As Ibn Wa'il al-Sahmi who was stung by something and died on the spot, may Allah keep him far from His mercy. And among them was al-Harth Ibn Qays al-Sahmi who ate salted fish which made him very thirsty. He drank so much water that his stomach burst open and he died, may Allah ruin him. And among them was al-Aswad Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib whose head Gabriel banged on a tree and then hit his face with thorns until he died, may Allah curse him. And among them is al-Aswad Ibn 'Abd Yaghuth who left his house in an extremely hot day and was caught by the simoom such that his colour turned black and resembled an Abyssinian. He went back to his house, but they refused to open the door for him. He banged the door with his head so hard that he died, may Allah forsake him. And among them was al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi who died as a result of an arrow which grazed his anklebone, may Allah banish him. All these people used to say before they died: \"the Lord of Muhammad (pbuh) has killed me\".\n"
