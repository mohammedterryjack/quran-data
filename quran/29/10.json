Yet if (la-in: the l\u0101m is for oaths) there comes help, to believers, from your Lord, and they take spoils, they will assuredly say (la-yaq\u016blunna: the [final] n\u016bn [of the indicative] has been omitted because of the other n\u016bn coming after it, and likewise the w\u0101w, indicating the plural person [has been replaced by a damma], because of two unvocalised consonants coming together), \u2018We were indeed with you\u2019, in faith, so give us a share of the booty.

(Is not Allah best aware of what is in the bosoms of (His) creatures) of good and evil? 'Ayyash and his friends embraced Islam afterwards and lived as good Muslims.\n"
