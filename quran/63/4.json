        "TRANSLATION_1": "Pleasing seem their persons when you look at them; and when they talk, you listen to their speech. Yet they are like the wooden panelling of a wall. They imagine every rebuke to be directed against them. They are the enemies, beware of them. May God damn them, how pervert are they!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "When you look at them, their persons are pleasing, and when they speak, you pay heed to what they say. But in truth they are (merely) beams of timber propped-up (against a wall). They consider every shout they hear to be directed against them. They are your utter enemies; guard against them. May Allah do away with them! How are they being turned away (from the Truth)?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Their physical appearance attracts you when you see them and when they speak, you carefully listen to them. In fact, they are like propped up hollow trunks of wood (They are so cowardly) they think that every cry which they hear is against them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. May God condemn them. Where are they turning to, leaving behind the Truth?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And when you see them, their appearance would please you; and when they speak, you would listen carefully to their speech; like wooden blocks propped against the wall; they assume every cry to be against them; they are the enemy, so beware of them; may Allah slay them! Where are they reverting!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "And when you look at them, their bodies please you; and when they speak, you listen to their words. They are as blocks of wood propped up.

        "TRANSLATION_6": "And when you see them, their persons will please you, and If they speak, you will listen to their speech; (they are) as if they were big pieces of wood clad with garments; they think every cry to be against them. They are the enemy, therefore beware of them; may Allah destroy them, whence are they turned back?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "When thou seest them, their bodies please thee; but when they speak, thou listenest to their speech, and it is as they were propped-up timbers. They think every cry is against them. They are the enemy; so beware of them. God assail them! How they are perverted!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "And when thou seest them their figures please thee; and if they speak thou givest ear unto their speech. (They are) as though they were blocks of wood in striped cloaks.

[Yet] they are, by virtue of the enormous size of their figures, [yet] in their lack of comprehension, like blocks of timber (read khushbun or khushubun) [that have been] propped-up, set reclining against a wall. They assume that every cry, made, like a battle-cry or one made to [retrieve] a lost camel, is [directed] against them, because of the [extent of] terror in their hearts, lest something should be revealed deeming their blood licit. They are the enemy, so beware of them, for they communicate your secrets to the disbelievers. May God assail them!, destroy them! How can they deviate?, how can they be turned away from faith after the proofs [for it] have been established?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And when thou) Muhammad (seest them) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his two friends (their figures please thee) their bodies and appearance please you; (and if they speak) saying: we know you are Allah's Messenger (thou givest ear unto their speech) you believe what they say and think they are truthful while they are not. ((They are)) i.e. their bodies are (as though they were blocks of wood in striped cloaks) aligned against the wall; He says: there is no goodness or light in their hearts just as dry wood has no life or moistness in it. (They deem every shout) every noise in Medina (to be against them) because of their cowardice. (They are the enemy, so beware of them) and never feel safe from them. (Allah confound them) Allah cursed them! (How they are perverted!) How they lie; it is also said this means: how they turn people away through lies!\n"
