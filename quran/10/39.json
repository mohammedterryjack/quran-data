        "TRANSLATION_0": "No, the fact is that they have denied something which their knowledge does not embrace and the the final fate of the wrongdoers!",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "In fact, they deny what is beyond the reach of their knowledge, whose explanation has not reached them yet. So had those who have gone before them denied; but look at the fate of the unjust\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "In fact they arbitrarily rejected as false whatever they failed to comprehend and whose final sequel was not apparent to them. Likewise had their predecessors rejected the truth, declaring it falsehood. Do observe, then, what was the end of the wrong-doers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "They call a lie something that is beyond the limit of their knowledge and whose interpretation has not yet been revealed. Some people who lived before them also called Our revelations lies. Consider how terrible was the end of the unjust people!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "On the contrary, they denied the thing the knowledge of which they could not master, whereas they have not yet seen its outcome; similarly those before them had denied, therefore see what sort of fate befell the unjust!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Nay, they have belied the knowledge whereof they could not comprehend and what has not yet been fulfilled. Thus those before them did belie. Then see what was the end of the wrongdoers!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "Nay, they reject that of which they have no comprehensive knowledge, and the final sequel of it has not yet come to them; even thus did those before them reject (the truth); see then what was the end of the unjust.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "No; but they have cried lies to that whereof they comprehended not the knowledge, and whose interpretation has not yet come to them. Even so those that were before them cried lies; then behold how was the end of the evildoers!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Nay, but they denied that, the knowledge whereof they could not compass, and whereof the interpretation (in events) hath not yet come unto them. Even so did those before them deny. Then see what was the consequence for the wrong-doers!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "Indeed, they are denying something which they cannot comprehend; the reality not yet having dawned on them. Likewise those before them rejected the truth. But see what was the end of the wrongdoers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "Aye! they have belied that of which the knowledge they comprehended not and of which the fulfilment hath not come to them. Likewise belied those who were before them; behold then in what wise hath been the end of the wrongdoers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "Indeed, they deny something whose knowledge they do not comprehend, and whose explanation has not yet come to them. Those who were before them denied likewise. So observe how was the fate of the wrongdoers!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "Nay, they charge with falsehood that whose knowledge they cannot compass, even before the elucidation thereof hath reached them: thus did those before them make charges of falsehood: but see what was the end of those who did wrong!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "Nay, they deny that; the knowledge whereof they could not compass and whereof the interpretation has not yet come unto them. Thus those before them did deny. Then see what was the end of the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.)!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "They have belied that which they did not understand of its knowledge, nor has its interpretation reached them. Those who were before also belied. But see how was the end of the harmdoers.\n",

So, in the same [manner of] denial, those who were before them denied, their messengers. Behold then what was the consequence for the evildoers!, for denying the messengers, in other words, [behold] how their affair was concluded, by their being destroyed. In a similar manner, We shall destroy these [people].\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Nay, but they denied that, the knowledge whereof they could not compass) they denied that which their knowledge could not embrace, (and whereof the interpretation) the consequence of what the Qur'an promised them (hath not yet come unto them. Even so) just as your people deny the Scriptures and messengers (did those before them deny) the Scriptures and messengers. (Then see) O Muhammad (what was the consequence for the wrong-doers!) what was the end result of the idolaters who denied the Scriptures and messengers and never worshipped Allah. It is also said that this was a consolation from Allah, glorified and Mighty is He, to His Prophet (pbuh) so that he endures their harm.\n"
