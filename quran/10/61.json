Not even the smallest speck eludes your Lord, either on earth or in heaven. Nor is there anything smaller than that, or larger, which is not in a Clear Book.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "There is no state you are in, whether reading from the Qur'an, or doing something else, but We are watching you as you are engaged in it. There is not the weight of an atom on the earth and in the heavens that is hidden from your Lord, nor is there anything smaller or greater than this but is recorded in the perspicuous Book.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "(O Prophet!) Whatever you may be engaged in, whether you recite any portion of the Qur'an, or whatever else all of you are doing, We are witnesses to whatever you may be occupied with. Not even an atom's weight escapes your Lord on the earth or in the heaven, nor is there anything smaller or bigger than that, except that it is on record in a Clear Book.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "(Muhammad), We bear witness to all your affairs; whatever you recite from the Quran and whatever you (people) do. Nothing in the heavens or the earth is hidden from your Lord, even that which is as small as an atom's weight or greater or smaller. All is recorded in the glorious Book.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And whatever work you (O dear Prophet Mohammed \u2013 peace and blessings be upon him) are engaged in and recite a part of the Qur\u2019an from Him, and whatever you people do, We are Witness upon you from the time you begin it; and there is nothing in the earth or in the heaven worth the weight of the smallest particle hidden from your Lord, nor anything smaller or greater than it, which is not recorded in a clear Book.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Neither you do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur'an, nor you do any deed, but We are Witness thereof when you are doing it.

Not what is less than that or what is greater than that but is (written) in a Clear Record.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "And you are not (engaged) in any affair, nor do you recite concerning it any portion of the Quran, nor do you do any work but We are witnesses over you when you enter into it, and there does not lie concealed from your Lord the weight of an atom in the earth or in the heaven, nor any thing less than that nor greater, but it is in a clear book.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "Thou art not upon any occupation, neither recitest thou any Koran of it, nor do you any work, without that We are witnesses over you when you press on it; and not so much as the weight of an ant in earth or heaven escapes from thy Lord, neither is aught smaller than that, or greater, but in a Manifest Book.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "And thou (Muhammad) art not occupied with any business and thou recitest not a Lecture from this (Scripture), and ye (mankind) perform no act, but We are Witness of you when ye are engaged therein.

And nothing is hidden from your Lord (so much as) the weight of an atom (or small ant) on the earth or in the heaven.

Not even the weight of an atom, on earth or in the sky, escapes your Lord, nor is there anything smaller or larger, but is in a clear record.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "And, [O Muhammad], you are not [engaged] in any matter or recite any of the Qur'an and you [people] do not do any deed except that We are witness over you when you are involved in it. And not absent from your Lord is any [part] of an atom's weight within the earth or within the heaven or [anything] smaller than that or greater but that it is in a clear register.\n",

And not so much as the weight of an atom, [the weight of] the smallest ant, in the earth or in the heaven escapes, is hidden from, your Lord, nor what is less than that or greater, but it is in a clear, a manifest, Book, namely, the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahf\u016bz).\n",

(And not an atom's weight) of the servants' works (in the earth or in the sky escapeth) is hidden from (your Lord, nor what is less) nor what is lighter (than that or greater than that) or heavier, (but it is (written) in a clear Book) but it is written in the Guarded Tablet.\n"
