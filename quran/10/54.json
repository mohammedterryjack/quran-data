        "TRANSLATION_3": "(On the Day of Judgment) to redeem oneself of one's injustice, one would gladly spend the wealth of the whole earth if it were possible. On seeing the torment one will try to hide his regret. They will all be judged fairly and no wrong will be done to them.\n",

(But it hath been judged between them) and the lowly among people (fairly) with justice (and they are not wronged) none of their good works will be diminished and none of their evil deeds will be increased.\n"
