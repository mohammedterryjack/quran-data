        "TRANSLATION_1": "If you come back to them by (the grace of) God, and they seek your permission to go (to fight), you should tell them: \"You will never go out nor fight the enemy with me any more. You preferred to stay back on the first occasion, so stay at home with those who stay behind.\"\n",

Ye were content with sitting still the first time) upon leaving for the Battle of Tabuk. (So sit still) not participating in jihad, (with the useless) with the women and children.\n"
