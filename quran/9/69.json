They enjoyed their lot awhile) they expend their share of the Hereafter in the life of this world, (so ye enjoy your lot awhile) you expended your share of the Hereafter in the life of this world (even as those before you) of hypocrites (did enjoy) expend (their lot awhile) their share of the Hereafter in the life of this world. (And ye prate) speak falsehood (even as they prated) and inwardly gave the lie to Muhammad (pbuh) just as those before them indulged in falsehood and gave the lie to the prophets of Allah.
