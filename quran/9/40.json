Then Allah sent down His serenity upon him and reinforced him with troops you could not see. He made the word of the kuffar undermost. It is the word of Allah which is uppermost. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "If you do not help (the Prophet, remember) God had helped him when the infidels had forced him to leave (and he was) one of two. When both of them were in the cave, he said to his companion: \"Do not grieve, for God is with us.\" Then God sent divine peace on him, and invisible armies for his help, and made the unbelievers' purpose abject. Most exalted is God's word, for God is all-mighty and all-wise.\n",

Allah is with us.\" Then Allah caused His tranquillity to descend upon him, and supported him with hosts you did not see, He humbled the word of the unbelievers. As for Allah's Word, it is inherently uppermost. Allah is All-Powerful, All-Wise.\n",

When the unbelievers expelled him and he was one of the two people in the cave telling his friend, \"Do not worry; God is with us,\" then God gave him confidence and supported him with an army which you did not see and He defeated the cause of the disbelievers and made His own cause stand supreme. God is Majestic and All-wise.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "If you do not help him (Prophet Mohammed \u2013 peace and blessings be upon him), Allah has helped him \u2013 when he had to go forth due to the mischief of the disbelievers, just as two men* \u2013 when they were in the cave, when he was saying to his companion \u201cDo not grieve; indeed Allah is with us\u201d; then Allah caused His calm to descend upon him and helped him with armies you did not see, and disgraced the word of the disbelievers; and Allah\u2019s Word is supreme; and Allah is the Almighty, the Wise.
