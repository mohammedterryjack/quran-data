These [others mentioned] are the three, who will be mentioned afterwards: Mur\u0101ra b. al-Rab\u012b\u2018, Ka\u2018b b. M\u0101lik and Hil\u0101l b. Umayya. They stayed behind out of laziness and their inclination for peace and quiet, not out of hypocrisy. Unlike the others, however, they did not excuse themselves before the Prophet (s), and so the matter regarding them was suspended for fifty days, during which time people avoided them, until it was later revealed that God had relented to them.\n",

(Allah is Knower) of their repentance and also of their staying behind, (Wise) in that which ordained concerning them.\n"
