They planned something which they did not achieve and they were vindictive for no other reason than that Allah and His Messenger had enriched them from His bounty. If they were to make tawba, it would be better for them. But if they turn away, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the Next World, and they will not find any protector or helper on the earth.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "They swear by God: \"We never said this.\" But they surely said words disbelieving the truth, and they turned unbelievers after having come to faith, and designed what they could not accomplish. They did it only out of vengeance for God and His Apostle had enriched them by their grace. So, if they repent it is better for them. If they turn away then God would afflict them with painful punishment in this world and the next; and none will they have on the face of the earth to protect or help them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "They swear by Allah that they said nothing blasphemous whereas they indeed blasphemed, and fell into unbelief after believing, and also had evil designs which they could not carry into effect. They are spiteful against Muslims for no other reason than that Allah and His Messenger have enriched them through His bounty! So, if they repent, it will be to their own good. But if they turn away, Allah will sternly punish them in this world and in the Hereafter. None in the world will be able to protect or help them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "They (the hypocrites) swear by the Name of God (to make others believe in what they are saying). They have spoken the testimony of disbelief and have then turned back to disbelief. They have made unsuccessful attempts to cause trouble. There is no other reason for their ungratefulness except that God and His Messenger enriched them through their favors. If they repent, it will be better for them, but if they turn away (from the faith), God will make them suffer a painful punishment both in this life and in the life hereafter. They will find no guardian nor any helper in the land.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And they swear by Allah that they did not say it; whereas indeed they had certainly uttered the words of disbelief, and after having entered Islam turned disbelievers and had wished for what they did not get; and what annoyed them except that Allah, and His Noble Messenger, made them prosperous with His grace?

So if they repent, it is better for them; but if they turn away, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter.

        "TRANSLATION_17": "[9:74] They, the hypocrites, swear by God that they said nothing, of the defamation that has reached you [as being] from them; but they did indeed say the word of disbelief and did disbelieve after their submission [to God]: they did indeed manifest disbelief after having manifested submission [to God]. And they purposed that which they never attained, in the way of assassinating the Prophet on the night of al-\u2018Aqaba, upon his return from Tab\u016bk \u2014 there were about ten to twenty of them, and \u2018Amm\u0101r b. Y\u0101sir struck the faces of their riding camels when they came against him and were thus repulsed; and they were only spiteful, they detested, that God and His Messenger should have enriched them of His bounty, by way of spoils, when they had been in dire need: the meaning is that this was all that they attained from him, which is nothing to be spiteful about. So if they repent, of hypocrisy and believe in you, it will be better for them; but if they turn away, from belief, God will chastise them with a painful chastisement in this world, by having them killed, and in the Hereafter, in the Fire, and they have none on earth as protector, to guard them from Him, or helper, to defend them.\n",

When 'Amir Ibn Qays informed the Prophet (pbuh) Jallas swore by Allah that he did not say this. But Allah gave him the lie and said (yet they did say the word of disbelief, and did disbelieve after their Surrender (to Allah). And they purposed that which they could not attain) they wanted to expel and kill the Messenger without success, (and they sought revenge) they could not find anything wrong with the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions (only that Allah by His messenger should enrich them of His bounty) through the spoils of war. (If they repent) from disbelief and hypocrisy (it will be better for them) than disbelief and hypocrisy; (and if they turn away) from repentance, (Allah will afflict them with a painful doom in the world and the Hereafter, and they have no protecting friend) who will protect them (nor helper in the earth) to prevent them from that which is wanted with them.\n"
