If you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, God will not forgive them: it is said that the \u2018seventy\u2019 is intended to express [by hyperbole] a great frequency of asking forgiveness. In [the Sah\u012bh of] al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b there is a had\u012bth [which states]: \u2018If I was sure that were I to ask more than seventy times, God would forgive [them], I would have done so\u2019. It is also said, however, that the very number [seventy] is actually meant, on account of this other had\u012bth of his: \u2018I shall ask more than seventy times\u2019, whereupon it was made clear to him [the Prophet] that the matter regarding forgiveness had been concluded by the verse, [Q. 63:6] Alike it will be regarding them: whether you ask forgiveness for them or you do not ask forgiveness for them [God will not forgive them]; that is because they disbelieved in God and His Messenger; and God does not guide the wicked folk.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Ask forgiveness for them (0 Muhammad)) Allah says: if you ask forgiveness for 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy, Jadd Ibn Qays, and Mu'attib Ibn Qushayr and their followers-who were about 70 men-, (or ask not forgiveness for them) it is all the same for them; (though thou ask forgiveness for them seventy times Allah will not forgive them) that punishment. (That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His messenger) in secret, (and Allah guideth not) forgives not (wrong-doing folk) the hypocrites: 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host.\n"
