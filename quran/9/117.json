They were short of provision and mounts and in great hardship because of the heat, the enemy and the long distance they had to travel. (After the hearts of a party of them had almost swerved aside) a party of sincere believers almost refrained from going forth with the Prophet (pbuh) (then turned He unto them in mercy) He forgave them and made their hearts firm such that they went with the Prophet (pbuh).
