They will swear by Allah: 'Had we been able to, we would have gone out with you.' They are destroying their own selves. Allah knows that they are lying.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "(O Prophet), had the gain been close at hand, and easy the journey, they would surely have followed you; but hard was the journey and long the going. Even then they swear by God (and say): \"If we had the strength we would surely have gone out with you.\" They are only ruining themselves, for God is aware they lie.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Were it a gain at hand or a short journey, they would have surely followed you, but the distance seemed too far to them. Still they will swear by Allah: \"If only we could, we would surely have gone forth with you.\" They merely bring ruin upon themselves. Allah knows well that they are liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Had the gain been immediate or the journey shorter, they (hypocrites) would certainly have followed you, (Muhammad), but it was too far for them. They will swear by God, \"Had we had the ability, we would certainly have marched with you.\" They destroy only themselves and God knows that they are lying.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Had there been some wealth near at hand or a short journey, they would have certainly accompanied you, but the difficult path became very distant for them; and they will now swear by Allah that \u201cHad we been able, we would have surely accompanied you\u201d; they destroy their own souls; and Allah knows that undoubtedly, they are indeed liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Had it been a near gain and an easy journey, they would have followed you, but the distance was long for them; and they would swear by Allah: \"If we only could, we would certainly have come forth with you.\" They destroy themselves, and Allah knows that they are liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "Had it been a near advantage and a short journey, they would certainly have followed you, but the tedious journey was too long for them; and they swear by Allah: If we had been able, we would certainly have gone forth with you; they cause their own souls to perish, and Allah knows that they are most surely\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "Were it a gain near at hand, and an easy journey, they would have followed thee; but the distance was too far for them.

        "TRANSLATION_17": "[9:42] The following was revealed regarding the hypocrites who stayed behind [away from the campaign]: Had it \u2014 that to which you summon them \u2014 been a near, easily acquired, gain, a transient pleasure of this world, and an easy journey, of moderate [length], they would have followed you, seeking spoils; but the distance, the hardship, was too great for them, and so they stayed behind. Still they will swear by God, when you return to them: [saying]: \u2018Had we been able, to go forth, we would have gone forth with you,\u2019 destroying their souls, by swearing false oaths, and God knows that they truly are liars, in this saying of theirs.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Had it been a near adventure) a near spoil of war (and an easy journey they had followed thee) to the Battle of Tabuk with a good disposition of the soul, (but the distance seemed too far for them) Historic Syria seemed too far for them. (Yet will they swear by Allah) to you when you come back from the Battle of Tabuk, i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Abi Wajd Ibn Qays, Mu'attib Ibn Qushayr and their companions who did not take part in the battle of Tabuk ((saying): If we had been able) to acquire provision and mount (we would surely have set out with you) to the Battle of Tabuk. (They destroy their souls) by lying in their oaths, (and Allah knoweth that they verily are liars) because they were able to set out with the Prophet (pbuh).\n"
