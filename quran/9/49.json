Qays, to whom the Prophet (s) said, \u2018Will you do battle against the Byzantines?\u2019, and to which he replied, \u2018I am infatuated with women, and I fear that if I were to see these Byzantine women, I shall not be able to stay away from them and be led into temptation\u2019. God, exalted be He, says: Surely they have [already] fallen into temptation!, by staying behind (a variant reading [for saqat\u016b, \u2018they have fallen\u2019] has [the singular form] saqat, \u2018he has fallen\u2019). And surely Hell shall encompass the disbelievers, for whom there shall be no escape therefrom.\n",
