        "TRANSLATION_1": "He has relented towards the three also (who had refused to go to the battle of the Ditch) whose case was left undecided, and even the earth with all its expanse had become narrow for them, and their lives were confined, and they came to realise there was no refuge for them except in God. So He softened towards them that they may repent; for God surely accepts repentance and is merciful.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "And He also relented towards the three whose cases had been deferred. When the earth, for all its spaciousness, became constrained to them, and their own beings became a burden to them, and they realized that there was no refuge for them from Allah except in Him; He relented towards them that they may turn back to Him. Surely, it is Allah Who is Much Forgiving, Ever Merciful.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "God also forgave the three people who lagged behind. Grief made them feel as though there was no place in the whole vast earth to hide them or in their souls to conceal their sorrow. They began to believe that no one could save them from (the wrath of God) except He Himself. God pardoned them so that they would also repent for their sins. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And also upon the three who were kept in waiting; when the earth, vast as it is, was restricted for them, and they became weary of their own lives and became certain that there is no refuge from Allah except with Him; He then accepted their repentance in order that they remain repentant; indeed Allah is the Most Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "And (Allah has forgiven) the three who stayed behind, until for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened and their souls were straitened to them, and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah, and no refuge but with Him.

Then He turned to them so they could repent. Indeed, Allah is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.\n",

Then He turned [relenting] to them, He made them successful in finding repentance, that they might also turn [in repentance]. Truly God is the Relenting, the Merciful.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And to the three also (did He turn in mercy) who were left behind) He also turned in mercy to the three who stayed behind: Ka'b Ibn Malik and his two Companions: (when the earth, vast as it is, was straitened for them, and their own souls were straitened for them) their hearts became straitened because of the delay in the acceptance of their repentance (till they bethought) until they knew and became certain (them that there is no refuge from Allah) that there is no safety from Allah (save towards Him) save in repenting to Him for failing to join in the Battle of Tabuk. (Then turned He unto them in mercy) He pardoned and forgave them (that they (too) might turn (repentant unto Him)) for failing to join in the Battle of Tabuk. (Lo! Allah! He is the Relenting) the Forgiving, (the Merciful) towards he who repents.\n"
