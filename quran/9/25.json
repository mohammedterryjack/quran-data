        "TRANSLATION_0": "Allah has helped you on many occasions, including the Day of Hunayn* when your great numbers delighted you but did not help you in any way, and the earth seemed narrow to you for all its great breadth, and you turned your backs.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Indeed God has helped you on many occasions, even during the battle of Hunain, when you were elated with joy at your numbers which did not prove of the least avail, so that the earth and its vast expanse became too narrow for you, and you turned back and retreated.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Surely Allah has succoured you before on many a battlefield, and (you have yourselves witnessed His succour to you) on the day of Hunayn when your numbers made you proud, but they did you no good, and the earth, for all its vastness, constrained you, and you turned your backs in retreat.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "God has helped you on many occasions including the day of Hunayn (name of a place near Mecca). When you were happy with the number of your men who proved to be of no help to you and the whole vast earth seemed to have no place to hide you (from your enemies) and you turned back in retreat.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Indeed Allah helped you on many occasions \u2013 and on the day of Huneyn \u2013 when you prided in your multitude, so it did not benefit you at all, and the earth despite being vast became restricted for you \u2013 then you turned back and returned.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Truly, Allah has given you victory on many battlefields, and on the day of Hunayn (battle) when you rejoiced at your great number, but it availed you naught and the earth, vast as it is, was straitened for you, then you turned back in flight.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "Certainly Allah helped you in many battlefields and on the day of Hunain, when your great numbers made you vain, but they availed you nothing and the earth became strait to you notwithstanding its spaciousness, then you turned back retreating.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "God has already helped you on many fields, and on the day of Hunain, when your multitude was pleasing to you, but it availed you naught, and the land for all its breadth was strait for you, and you turned about, retreating.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Allah hath given you victory on many fields and on the day of Huneyn, when ye exulted in your multitude but it availed you naught, and the earth, vast as it is, was straitened for you; then ye turned back in flight;\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "Indeed, God has helped you on many occasions. On the day of Hunayn, when you took pride in your great numbers, they proved of no avail to you -- for the earth, despite all its vastness, became [too] narrow for you and you turned back, in retreat.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "Assuredly Allah hath succoured you on many fields and on the day of Hunain, When your number elated you; then it availed you naught, and the earth, wide as it is, straitened unto you; then ye turned away in retreat.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "Allah has certainly helped you in many situations, and on the day of Hunayn, when your great number impressed you, but it did not avail you in any way, and the earth became narrow for you in spite of its expanse, whereupon you turned your backs [to flee].\n",

        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Allah hath given you victory on many fields) on many battlefields (and on the day of Hunayn) and especially on the day of Hunayn, a valley between Mecca and Ta'if, (when ye exulted in your multitude) when you were pleased by your sheer numbers. They were then 10,000 men (but it availed you naught) but your multitude did not prevent your defeat, (and the earth, vast as it is, was straitened for you) because of fear; (then ye turned back in flight) from the enemy, who consisted of 4,000 men;\n"
