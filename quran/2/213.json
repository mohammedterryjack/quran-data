Then Allah sent out Prophets bringing good news and giving warning, and with them He sent down the Book with truth to decide between people regarding their differences. Only those who were given it differed about it, after the Clear Signs had come to them, envying one another. Then, by His permission, Allah guided those who had iman to the truth of that about which they had differed. Allah guides whomever He wills to a straight path.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Men belonged to a single community, and God sent them messengers to give them happy tidings and warnings, and sent the Book with them containing the truth to judge between them in matters of dispute; but only those who received it differed after receiving clear proofs, on account of waywardness (and jealousies) among them. Then God by His dispensation showed those who believed the way to the truth about which they were differing; for God shows whom He please the path that is straight.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "In the beginning all the people followed the same way. (Afterwards there came a change and differences arose). Then Allah sent Prophets to give good tidings to those who followed the Right Way and warnings to those who swerved from it. And He sent down with them the Book based on the Truth so that it should judge between the people concerning their differences. (Differences arose not because people were not given the knowledge of the Truth in the beginning, nay), differences arose between those very people who had been given clear teachings, and (for no other reasons than that) they wanted to tyrannize over one another. So Allah, by His leave, guided those who believed in the Prophets to the Truth about which they had differed; AIIah guides whomever He pleases to the Right Way.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "At one time all people were only one nation. God sent Prophets with glad news and warnings. He sent the Book with them for a genuine purpose to provide the people with the ruling about disputed matters among them. No one disputed this matter except those who had already received evidence before. Their dispute was only because of their own hostility. To deal with this dispute, God, through His will, sent guidance to the believers. God guides to the right path whomever He wants.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Mankind was on one religion; so Allah sent Prophets giving glad tidings and warnings \u2013 and with them sent down the true Book to judge between mankind on their differences; and only those to whom it was given created disputes regarding the Book, after clear commands had come to them, due to hostility of one another; so Allah, by His command, made the truth clear to the believers, concerning their disputes; and Allah may guide whomever He wills to the Straight Path.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Mankind was one community and Allah sent Prophets with glad tidings and warnings, and with them He sent down the Scripture in truth to judge between people in matters wherein they differed.

        "TRANSLATION_9": "Mankind was once a single community, [but then people developed differences], so God sent prophets to them as bearers of good tidings and warning, and sent down with them the Book containing the truth, so that He might judge between their disputes. It was only those to whom it [the scripture] was given who disagreed about it after clear signs had come to them, because of rivalry between them. God by His will guided the believers to the truth about which the others had disputed. God guides whom He will to a straight path.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_17": "[2:213] People were one community, in faith, but they fell into disagreement, and some believed, while others disbelieved; then God sent forth the prophets, to them, as bearers of good tidings, of Paradise for the believers, and warners, of the Fire for the disbelievers; and He revealed with them the Scripture, meaning, the Books, with the truth (bi\u2019l-haqqi, \u2018with the truth\u2019, is semantically connected to anzala, \u2018He revealed\u2019) that He might decide, according to it, between people regarding their differences, in religion; and only those who had been given it, the Scripture, so that some believed while others disbelieved, differed about it, [about] religion, after the clear proofs, the manifest arguments for God\u2019s Oneness, had come to them (min [of min ba\u2018di, \u2018after\u2019] is semantically connected to ikhtalafa, \u2018they differed\u2019, and together with what follows should be understood as coming before the exception [ill\u0101 lladh\u012bna, \u2018only those\u2019]); out of insolence, on the part of the disbelievers, one to another; then God guided those who believed to the truth, regarding which (min [of min al-haqqi, \u2018of the truth\u2019] here is explicative) they were at variance, by His leave, by His will; and God guides, with His guidance, whomever He will to a straight path, the path of truth.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Mankind were) in the times of Noah and Abraham (one community) of disbelievers; as it is said that this means: there were in the time of Abraham followers of the true Religion (Muslims), (and Allah sent Prophets) from the children of Noah and Abraham (as bearers of good tidings) of Paradise for whoever believes in Allah (and as warners) from hell for whoever does not believe in Allah, (and revealed therewith the Scripture) He sent down Gabriel to them with the Scripture, (with the Truth) expositing what is true and what is false (that it might judge) so that each prophet would judge by his Scripture (between mankind concerning that wherein they differed) in Religion; it is also said that this means: so that the Scripture is used as a final authority; and it is also said that this means: so that the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) rules them by the Scripture. (And only those unto whom (the Scripture) was given differed concerning it) concerning the Religion and Muhammad (pbuh) (after clear proofs had come unto them) clear proofs from their own Scripture, (through hatred one of another) out of resentful envy from their part and this is why they disbelieved in it. (And Allah by His will guided those who believe) by means of the prophets (unto the Truth of that concerning which they differed) in Religion. It is also said that this means: Allah protected the believers by means of the prophets from that which they differed over in matters of Religion, and directed them from falsehood to the Truth. (Allah guideth whom He will) whomever deserves it; and it is also said that this means: Allah holds firm whomever He wills by His grace and will (unto a straight path) unto an established religion that He is pleased with.\n"
