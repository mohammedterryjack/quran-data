The occasion for the revelation [of this verse] was: Ma\u2018qil b. Yas\u0101r\u2019s sister was divorced by her husband, who then wanted to restore her, but Ma\u2018qil refused, as reported by al-H\u0101kim.

(This) what is mentioned above (is an admonition) a command (for him among you who believeth in Allah and the Last Day. This) what is mentioned above (is more virtuous) better (for you, and cleaner) for your hearts and theirs from misgivings 40 and enmity. (Allah knoweth) the love of the wife for her husband: (while ye know not) this. This verse was revealed about Ma'qil Ibn Yasar al-Muzani who prevented his sister Jamilah from returning to her first husband 'Abdullah Ibn 'Asim with a new dowry and marriage contract.
