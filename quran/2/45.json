The singling out of this for mention is a way of emphasising its great importance; in one had\u012bth, [it is stated], \u2018When something bothered the Prophet (s), he would immediately resort to prayer\u2019; it is said that the address here is to the Jews: when greed and desire for leadership became impediments to their faith, they were enjoined to forbearance, which constituted fasting and prayer, since, the former stems from lust and the latter yields humility and negates pride. For it, prayer, is grievous, burdensome, except to the humble, those that are at peace in obedience,\n",
