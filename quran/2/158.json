It is reported from Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s that this pacing [between the two] is not obligatory, based on the fact that when no sin can be incurred, the context implies free choice. Al-Sh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b and others, however, considered it to be a pillar [of the Pilgrimage rituals]. The Prophet made clear its obligatory aspect when he said that, \u2018God has prescribed for you the pacing [sa\u2018y]\u2019, as reported by al-Bayhaq\u012b and others; and he [the Prophet] also said, \u2018Begin with what God has begun\u2019, meaning, al-Saf\u0101, as reported by Muslim; and whoever volunteers (tatawwa\u2018a: a variant reading is yattawa\u2018, the ta\u2019 here being assimilated) good, that is, any good deed such as circumambulation or other, that is not obligatory on him; God is Grateful, for such a deed and rewards that person for it, Knowing, it.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Allah then mentions the believers' dislike of going between al-Safa and al-Marwah in front of the idols which were placed there, saying: (Lo! Al-Safa and al-Marwah) going around al-Safa and al-Marwah (are among the rites of Allah) among the rites of pilgrimage that Allah, Exalted is He, has commanded. (It is therefore no sin) one commits no transgression (for him who is on pilgrimage to the House or visiteth it, to go around them (as the pagan custom is). And he who doeth good of his own accord) and whoever performs extra works other than this obligation of going between al-Safa and al-Marwah, (Lo! Allah is Responsive) accepts such works, (Aware) of your intentions; it is also said that this means: Allah accepts the smallest of your works and His reward is abundant.\n"
