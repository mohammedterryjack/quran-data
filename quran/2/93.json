Say, to them: \u2018Evil is that, thing, which your belief, in the Torah, enjoins on you, [in the way of] the worship of the [golden] calf, if you are believers\u2019, in it, as you claim; meaning, you are not believers, for faith does not command that you worship the calf \u2014 their forefathers are meant here. Likewise, you do not believe in the Torah, because you have denied [the prophethood of] Muhammad (s), whereas faith in it does not command you to reject him.\n",

(And (worship of) the calf was made to sink into their hearts) their love of worshipping the calf sank into their hearts (because of their rejection) as a punishment for their disbelief. (Say (unto them)) Muhammad! If love of worshipping the calf is equal in your eyes to love of your Creator, then: (Evil is that which your belief enjoineth on you) the worship of the calf enjoins on you, (if ye are believers) if you are truthful that your forefathers were believers.\n"
