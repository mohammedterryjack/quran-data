        "TRANSLATION_1": "God is not loath to advance the similitude of a gnat or a being more contemptible; and those who believe know whatever is from the Lord is true. But those who disbelieve say: \"What does God mean by this parable?\" He causes some to err this way, and some He guides; yet He turns away none but those who transgress,\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Well, Allah is not ashamed to cite the similitude of a gnat or of something even more insignificant than this. As for those who believe, they come to know from the same similitude that it is the Revelation from their Lord; but those who disbelieve, say, \"What does Allah mean by such similitudes?\" Allah leads astray many and guides many to the right way by the same thing. And He leads astray only those who disobey Allah;\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "God does not hesitate to set forth parables of anything even a gnat. The believers know that it is the truth from their Lord, but those who deny the truth say, \"What does God mean by such parables?\" In fact, by such parables God misleads and guides many. However, He only misleads the evil doers\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Indeed Allah does not, for the sake of explanation, shy to illustrate an example of anything, whether it is of a gnat or something further (inferior) than it; so the believers know it is the Truth from their Lord; as for the disbelievers, they say, \u201cWhat does Allah intend by such an example?\u201d He misleads many thereby, and He guides many thereby; and with it He misleads only those who are rebellious.\n",

But He makes only the disobedient go astray:\n",

Those who believe know that it is truth from their Lord; but those who reject Faith say: \"What means Allah by this similitude?\" By it He causes many to stray, and many He leads into the right path; but He causes not to stray, except those who forsake (the path),-\n",

        "TRANSLATION_17": "[2:26] God is not ashamed to strike, to make, a similitude (mathal: is the first direct object; m\u0101 either represents an indefinite noun described by what comes after it and constitutes a second direct object, meaning \u2018whatever that similitude may be\u2019; or it [the m\u0101] is extra to emphasise the vileness [involved], so that what follows constitutes the second direct object); even of a gnat, (ba\u2018\u016bda is the singular of ba\u2018\u016bd), that is, small flies; or anything above it, that is, larger than it, so that this explanation is not affected [by the size of the creature] with regard to the judgement [God is making]; as for the believers, they know it, the similitude, is the truth, established and given in this instance, from their Lord; but as for disbelievers, they say, \u2018What did God desire by this for a similitude?\u2019 (mathalan is a specification, meaning, \u2018by this similitude\u2019; m\u0101 is an interrogative of rejection and is the subject; dh\u0101 means alladh\u012b, whose relative clause contains its predicate, in other words, \u2018what use is there in it?\u2019). God then responds to them saying: Thereby, that is, by this similitude, He leads many astray, from the truth on account of their disbelieving in it, and thereby He guides many, believers on account of their belief in it; and thereby He leads none astray except the wicked, those that reject obedience to Him.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Then Allah mentioned the Jews' objection to the Qur'an's similes, saying: (Lo! Allah disdaineth not), He cannot abstain from coining similes, and how can He disdain mentioning something that if all created being were to join forces to create, they would not be able to do so. Allah does not disdain (to coin the similitude) Allah does not disdain explaining to people a similitude (even of a gnat), even regarding a gnat, (or what is above it) let alone a simile of something greater than a gnat such as a fly, or a spider. (Those who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (know that it), the simile, (is the Truth from their Lord; but those who disbelieve), in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (say: What doth Allah wish (to teach) by such similitude?) say: Muhammad! What Allah wishes by such simile is that (He misleadeth many thereby) of the Jews from the true Religion, (and He guideth many thereby) of the believers, (and He misleadeth thereby), by such similes, (only miscreants), the Jews.\n"
