If any of you is sick, or has an ailment of the head, such as lice or severe pains, and has thus shaved his head while in a state of pilgrimage inviolability, then, incumbent upon him is, a redemption by fast, for three days, or a voluntary almsgiving, consisting of three cubic measures of the principal food of the town for six needy persons, or a ritual sacrifice, that is, the slaughter of a sheep (aw, \u2018or\u2019, denotes freedom of choice).

In such a case, he should enter into the state of pilgrimage inviolability before the seventh of Dh\u016b\u2019l-Hijja, but ideally before the sixth, because one is discouraged from fasting on the Day of \u2018Arafa. Moreover, he should not fast during these the days of tashr\u012bq, according to the sounder of two opinions attributed to al-Sh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b.

If they are [present however], then no blood [sacrifice] or fast is obligatory in his case, even if he has enjoyed [the Visitation].

The term ahl, \u2018family\u2019, is said to denote \u2018oneself\u2019.

(And if ye are prevented) from performing the pilgrimage or the lesser pilgrimage because of enemies or ill-health, (then send such gifts as can be obtained with ease) then you should offer whatever gifts you can obtain: a sheep, cow or camel in order to leave the Sacred Precinct, (and shave not your heads) if you are prevented (until the gifts) that you have sent (have reached their destination) where it is going to be immolated. (And whoever among you is sick) and cannot remain in the place where he is, then he can return home before his gift reaches its destination (or hath an ailment of the head) or if his head is infested with lice, he should shave it. This verse was revealed about Ka'b Ibn 'Ujrah who shaved his hair when still in a state of ritual consecration because it was infested with lice, (must pay ransom of fasting) the ransom is to fast three days (or almsgiving) to six needy people from the inhabitants of Mecca (or offering) a sheep to be sent to the place of immolation. (And if ye are in safety) from the enemy and you have recovered from your sickness, then you should make up that which Allah has made obligatory upon you in the following year, whether it is a question of the pilgrimage or the lesser pilgrimage, (then whoever contenteth himself with) perfume and clothes after (the visit) the lesser pilgrimage and until he engages in ritual consecration (for the Pilgrimage (shall give) such gifts) then he should offer a sacrifice for making 'Umrah before Hajj (dam al-tamattu') and a sacrifice for doing Hajj and 'Umrah simultaneously (dam al-qaran wa'l-mut'a), whether it is a sheep, cow or camel (as can be had with ease. And whoever cannot find (such gifts)) either a sheep, cow or camel, (then a fast of three days) a fast of three consecutive days (while on the pilgrimage) in the ten days of the pilgrimage, the last of which being the Day of 'Arafah, (and of seven when ye have returned) on your way to your families or after you have returned to your families; (that is, ten in all) in exchange for the gifts. (That) i.e. offering a sacrifice for making 'Umrah before Hajj (is for him whose folk are not present at the Inviolable Place of Worship) whose family and home is not in the Sacred Precinct because the inhabitants of the Sacred Precinct are not obligated to give the offering for making 'Umrah before Hajj. (Observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah if you leave what you have been commanded to do, (and know that Allah is severe in punishment) towards anyone who leaves what he has been commanded to do, whether it is the offering of gifts or fasting.\n"
