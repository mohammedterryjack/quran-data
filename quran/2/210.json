The matter is determined, the matter of their destruction has been completed, and to God all matters are returned, in the Hereafter, where He will requite each according to his deeds (read passive [turja\u2018u al-um\u016br, \u2018matters are returned\u2019] or active [tarji\u2018u al-um\u016br, \u2018matters return\u2019]).\n",
