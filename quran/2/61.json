Go back to Egypt, then you will have what you are asking for.' Abasement and destitution were stamped upon them. They brought down anger from Allah upon themselves. That was because they rejected Allah's Signs and killed the Prophets without any right to do so. That was because they rebelled and went beyond the limits.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Remember, when you said: \"O Moses, we are tired of eating the same food (day after day), ask your Lord to give us fruits of the earth, herbs and cucumbers, grains and lentils and onions;\" he said: \"Would you rather exchange what is good with what is bad? Go then to the city, you shall have what you ask.\" So they were disgraced and became indigent, earning the anger of God, for they disbelieved the word of God, and slayed the prophets unjustly, for they transgressed and rebelled.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Remember: You grumbled: \"O Moses, we cannot endure one and the same sort of food. Pray your Lord to bring for us the products of the earth green herbs, vegetables, corn, garlic, onions, pulses and the like.\" Moses replied: \"What! would you exchange that which is meaner for that which is nobler? Well, go and live in a town and you will get there what you demand.\" By and by, they became so degraded that disgrace and humiliation, misery and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they incurred Allah's wrath. That was because they began to reject the Revelations of Allah and kill His Messengers without any just cause; that was the consequence of their disobedience and their persistent transgression against the Law.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "When you demanded Moses to provide you with a variety of food, saying, \"We no longer have patience with only one kind of food, ask your Lord to grow green herbs, cucumbers, corn, lentils, and onions for us,\" Moses replied, \"Would you change what is good for what is worse? Go to any town and you will get what you want.\" Despised and afflicted with destitution, they brought the wrath of God back upon themselves, for they denied the evidence (of the existence of God) and murdered His Prophets without reason; they were disobedient transgressors.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And when you said, \u201cO Moosa! We shall never put up with only one kind of food, so call upon your Lord to produce for us what the earth grows \u2013 some herbs, cucumbers, corn, lentils and onions\u201d; he said, \u201cWhat! You wish to exchange the better for something inferior? Therefore settle down in Egypt or any city, where you will get what you demand\u201d; and disgrace and misery were destined for them; and they returned towards Allah\u2019s wrath; that was because they disbelieved in Allah\u2019s signs and wrongfully martyred the Prophets; that was for their disobedience and transgression.\n",

So invoke your Lord for us to bring forth for us of what the earth grows, its herbs, its cucumber its Fum, its lentils and its onions.\" He said, \"Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower Go you down to any town and you shall find what you want!\" And they were covered with humiliation and misery, and they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. That was because they used to disbelieve in the Ayat (proofs, evidence) of Allah and killed the Prophets wrongfully. That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds (in their disobedience to Allah, i.e. commit crimes and sins.)\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "And when you said: O Musa! we cannot bear with one food, therefore pray Lord on our behalf to bring forth for us out of what the earth grows, of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions. He said: Will you exchange that which is better for that which is worse? Enter a city, so you will have what you ask for. And abasement and humiliation were brought down upon them, and they became deserving of Allah's wrath; this was so because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and killed the prophets unjustly; this was so because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "And when you said, 'Moses, we will not endure one sort of food; pray to thy Lord for us, that He may bring forth for us of that the earth produces - green herbs, cucumbers, corn, lentils, onions.' He said, 'Would you have in exchange what is meaner for what is better? Get you down to Egypt; you shall have there that you demanded.' And abasement and poverty were pitched upon them, and they were laden with the burden of God's anger; that, because they had disbelieved the signs of God and slain the Prophets unrightfully; that, because they disobeyed, and were transgressors.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "And when ye said: O Moses! We are weary of one kind of food; so call upon thy Lord for us that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth - of its herbs and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils and its onions.

Go to some town and there you will find all that you demand.\" Abasement and destitution were stamped upon them, and they incurred the wrath of God, for having rejected His signs, and they killed His prophets unjustly, because they were rebels and transgressors.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "And recall what time ye said: O Musa! we shall by no means bear patiently with one food, wherefore supplicate for us unto thy Lord that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth, of its vegetables, and its cucumbers, and its Wheat, and its lentils, and its onions. He Said: would ye take in exchange that which is mean for that which is better! Get ye down into a City, as verily therein is for you that which ye ask for. And stuck upon them were abjection and poverty. And they drew on themselves indignation from Allah. This, because they were ever disbelieving in the signs of Allah and slaying the prophets without justice. This, because they disobeyed and were ever trespassing.\n",

So invoke your Lord for us, so that He may bring forth for us of that which the earth grows\u2014its greens and cucumbers, its garlic, lentils, and onions.\u2019 He said, \u2018Do you seek to replace what is superior with that which is inferior? Go down to any town and you will indeed get what you ask for!\u2019 So they were struck with abasement and poverty, and they earned Allah\u2019s wrath.

Go ye down to any town, and ye shall find what ye want!\" They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah.
