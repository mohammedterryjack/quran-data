The same applies to forgetfulness after one remembers, error after being right and coercion after exerting one's effort freely. (He will forgive whom He will) He will forgive the one who repents of all sins (and He will punish whom He will) He will punish the one who does not repent. (And Allah is Able to do all things) in terms of forgiveness and punishment.\n"
