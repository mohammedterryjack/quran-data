        "TRANSLATION_0": "The metaphor of those who spend their wealth, desiring the pleasure of Allah and firmness for themselves, is that of a garden on a hillside. When heavy rain falls on it, it doubles its produce; and if heavy rain does not fall, there is dew. Allah sees what you do.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "But the semblance of those who expend their wealth to please God with firm and resolute hearts, is like a garden on a height on which the rain falls and it yields its fruits twice as much; and even if the rain does not fall the dew will suffice. For God sees all that you do.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "In contrast to them, the charity of those, who expend their wealth sincerely with the sole desire of pleasing Allah, may be likened to a garden on a plateau. If heavy rain falls, it yields its produce twofold: and even if there is no heavy rain but only a light shower, that too, is sufficient for it: whatever you do is in the sight of Allah.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "The example of those who spend their property to please God out of their firm and sincere intention is as the garden on a fertile land which, after a heavy rainfall or even a drizzle, yields double produce. God is Well-Aware of what you do.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And the example of those who spend their wealth in order to seek Allah\u2019s pleasure and to make their hearts steadfast, is similar to that of a garden on a height \u2013 hard rain fell on it, so bringing forth its fruit twofold; so if hard rain does not reach it, the dew is enough; and Allah is seeing your deeds.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "And the parable of those who spend their wealth seeking Allah's pleasure while they in their own selves are sure and certain that Allah will reward them (for their spending in His cause), is that of a garden on a height; heavy rain falls on it and it doubles its yield of harvest. And if it does not receive heavy rain, light rain suffices it. And Allah is All-Seer (knows well) of what you do.) This is the example of the believers who give away charity seeking only Allah's pleasure,\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "And the parable of those who spend their property to seek the pleasure of Allah and for the certainty 'of their souls is as the parable of a garden on an elevated ground, upon which heavy rain falls so it brings forth its fruit twofold but if heavy rain does not fall upon it, then light rain (is sufficient); and Allah sees what you do.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "But the likeness of those who expend their wealth, seeking God's good pleasure, and to confirm themselves, is as the likeness of a garden upon a hill; a torrent smites it and it yields its produce twofold; if no torrent smites it, yet dew; and God sees the things you do.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "And the likeness of those who spend their wealth in search of Allah's pleasure, and for the strengthening of their souls, is as the likeness of a garden on a height. The rainstorm smiteth it and it bringeth forth its fruit twofold. And if the rainstorm smite it not, then the shower. Allah is Seer of what ye do.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "But those who spend their wealth in order to gain God's approval, and to strengthen their souls are like a garden on elevated ground. When heavy rain falls on it, it doubles its produce; and if heavy rain does not fall, then light rain suffices. God sees what you do.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "And the likeness of those who expend their riches seeking the pleasure of Allah and for the strengthening of their souls is as the likeness of a garden on a height. A heavy rain falleth upon it, and it yieldeth its fruits two-fold and if no heavy rain falleth upon it, then a gentle rain and Allah is of that which ye work Beholder.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "The parable of those who spend their wealth seeking Allah\u2019s pleasure and to confirm themselves [in their faith], is that of a garden on a hillside: the downpour strikes it, whereupon it brings forth its fruit twofold; and if it is not a downpour that strikes it, then a shower, and Allah watches what you do.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "And the likeness of those who spend their substance, seeking to please Allah and to strengthen their souls, is as a garden, high and fertile: heavy rain falls on it but makes it yield a double increase of harvest, and if it receives not Heavy rain, light moisture sufficeth it. Allah seeth well whatever ye do.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "And the likeness of those who spend their wealth seeking Allah's Pleasure while they in their ownselves are sure and certain that Allah will reward them (for their spending in His Cause), is the likeness of a garden on a height; heavy rain falls on it and it doubles its yield of harvest. And if it does not receive heavy rain, light rain suffices it. And Allah is All-Seer of (knows well) what you do.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "But those who give away their wealth with a desire to please Allah and to reassure themselves are like a garden on a hillside, if heavy rain strikes it, it yields up twice its normal crop, and if heavy rain does not strike it, then light rain. Allah is the Seer of what you do.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "And the parable of those who spend their wealth seeking God\u2019s approval, and to strengthen their souls, is that of a garden on a hillside. If heavy rain falls on it, its produce is doubled; and if no heavy rain falls, then dew is enough. God is seeing of everything you do.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "And the example of those who spend their wealth seeking means to the approval of Allah and assuring [reward for] themselves is like a garden on high ground which is hit by a downpour - so it yields its fruits in double. And [even] if it is not hit by a downpour, then a drizzle [is sufficient]. And Allah, of what you do, is Seeing.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[2:265] But the likeness, of the expenditure, of those who expend their wealth, seeking God\u2019s good pleasure, and to confirm themselves, that is, to realise the reward thereof, in contrast to the hypocrites who do not hope for it, since they do not believe in it, is as the likeness of a garden, an orchard, upon a hill, (read rabwa or rubwa) a high ground; a torrent smites it and it yields, gives forth, its produce (read ukulah\u0101 or uklah\u0101), its fruits, twofold, twice the fruits of another [garden]; if no torrent smites it, then dew, (tall, a light drizzle) which falls on it and suffices it on account of its altitude. In other words, it grows and bears fruit, regardless of how much rain falls; likewise are the expenditures of those mentioned: they will increase with God, regardless of how much they were; and God sees what you do, and He will requite you for it.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And the likeness of those who spend their wealth) the likeness of the wealth of those who spend it (in search of Allah's pleasure) seeking Allah's pleasure, (and for the strengthening of their souls) truly, out of conviction and certitude in their hearts that they will be rewarded, (is as the likeness of a garden on a height) on an elevated plain. (The rainstorm smiteth it and it bringeth forth its fruit twofold. And if the rainstorm smite it not, then the shower) this is like the spending of the believer, whether small or great, when it is done with sincerity and fearingness, Allah multiplies it as He multiplies the fruits of a garden. (Allah is Seer of what ye do) of what you spend.\n"
