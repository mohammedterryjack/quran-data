It is also said that the [l\u0101] negation of the verb [yut\u012bq\u016bnahu] is not actually implied, because at the very beginning of Islam, they could choose between fasting or offering the redemption; but later on this was abrogated by fixing the Fast [as an obligation], where God says, So let those of you, who are present at the month, fast it [Q. 2:185]: Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s said [by way of qualification] \u2018Except for the pregnant one and the one breastfeeding, if they break their fast out of   concern for the child; in the case of these two, the verse remains valid and has not been abrogated\u2019). For him who volunteers good, by offering more than the minimum amount mentioned for the redemption; that, volunteering, is good for him; but that you should fast (wa-an tas\u016bm\u016b is the subject) is better for you (khayrun lakum is its predicate), than breaking the fast and paying the redemption, if you but knew, that this is better for you, then do it.\n",

But this is abrogated by Allah's saying: (And whoever of you is present, let him fast the month). It is also said that this means: those who can afford a ransom and are not able to fast, old men and women who are unable to fast, they should feed a needy person, for every missed day of fast in Ramadan, half a measure of wheat. (But whoso doeth good of his own accord) gives more than two pounds, (it is better for him) in terms of reward: (and that ye fast is better for you) than giving ransom (if ye did but know-)\n"
