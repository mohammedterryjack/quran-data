        "TRANSLATION_5": "He (Musa) said, \"He says, `It is a cow neither trained to till the soil nor water the fields, sound, having no blemish in it.' \" They said, \"Now you have brought the truth.\" So they slaughtered it though they were near to not doing it.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_7": "He said, 'He says she shall be a cow not broken to plough the earth or to water the tillage, one kept secure, with no blemish on her.' They said, 'Now thou hast brought the truth'; and therefore they sacrificed her, a thing they had scarcely done.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_17": "[2:71] He said, \u2018He says she shall be a cow not broken, not subdued for labour, that is, to plough the earth, churning its soil for sowing (tuth\u012br al-ard: the clause describes the word dhal\u016bl, and constitutes part of the negation); or to water the tillage, that is, the land prepared for sowing; one safe, from faults and the effects of toil; with no blemish, of a colour other than her own, on her\u2019. They said, \u2018Now you have brought the truth\u2019, that is, [now] you have explained it clearly; they thus sought it out and found it with a boy very dutiful towards his mother, and they eventually purchased it for the equivalent of its weight in gold; and so they sacrificed her, even though they very nearly did not, on account of its excessive cost. In a had\u012bth [it is stated that], \u2018Had they sacrificed any cow, it would have sufficed them, but they made it difficult for themselves and so God made it difficult for them\u2019.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "((Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Surely she is a cow unyoked) unfettered; (she plougheth not the soil) she is not subjugated for the ploughing of the soil (nor watereth the tilth) nor for carrying water to irrigate it; (whole) free from any blemish (and without mark) spots or flecks of white. (They said: now thou bringest the Truth) now we know the cow's right description. They looked for it and bought her in exchange for her weight in gold. (So they sacrificed her, though almost they did not) i.e. initially; as it is said because the cow was hugely expensive.\n"
