It is not lawful for you to keep anything you have given them unless a couple fear that they will not remain within Allah's limits. If you fear that they will not remain within Allah's limits, there is nothing wrong in the wife ransoming herself with some of what she received. These are Allah's limits, so do not overstep them. Those who overstep Allah's limits are wrongdoers.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Divorce is (revokable) two times (after pronouncement), after which (there are two ways open for husbands), either (to) keep (the wives) honourably, or part with them in a decent way. You are not allowed to take away the least of what you have given your wives, unless both of you fear that you would not be able to keep within the limits set by God. If you fear you cannot maintain the bounds fixed by God, there will be no blame on either if the woman redeems herself.

There is, however, an exception to this; if you fear that they might not be able to keep within the limits imposed by Allah, there is no harm if both agree mutually that the wife should obtain divorce by giving something as compensation to the husband.

It is not lawful for you to take back from women what you have given them unless you are afraid of not being able to observe God's law.

It is not lawful for you, O male spouses, to take of what you have given them, of dowry, if you   divorce them, unless the, married, couple fear that they may not maintain God\u2019s bounds, that is to say, that they will not honour the rights God has established for them (a variant reading [for yakh\u0101f\u0101, \u2018they (dual form) fear\u2019] has yukh\u0101f\u0101, with the direct object taking the accusative ending; all\u0101 yuq\u012bm\u0101 is an inclusive substitution for the person [governing the verb]; both verbs are also read in the second person [sc. takh\u0101f\u0101, \u2018you fear\u2019, tuq\u012bm\u0101, \u2018you maintain\u2019]). If you fear they may not maintain God\u2019s bounds, neither of them would be at fault if she were to ransom herself, of some money, so that he should divorce her. In other words, in this instance, there is no culpability either for the man, should he take of the dowry, or for the woman, should she offer of it. Those, prescriptions mentioned, are God\u2019s bounds; do not transgress them. Whoever transgresses God\u2019s bounds \u2014 those are the evildoers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Divorce must be pronounced twice) He says: the divorce in which a man is entitled to take back his wife is pronounced once on two separate occasions (and then (a woman) must be retained) before she is pronounced divorced a third time and before performing major ritual ablution from the third menstruation (in honour) with kind companionship and intercourse (or released in kindness) or divorced a third time with such kindness as restores her rights. (And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women aught of that which ye have given them) of dowry; (except (in the case) when both arbiters) when the husband and wife both know that she wants to ransom her divorce (fear that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife. (And if ye fear) if you know (that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (in that case it is no sin for either of them) and especially the husband (if the woman ransom herself) if the husband takes what the woman ransoms herself with, out of the generosity of her soul. This verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose wife Jamilah was the daughter of 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, chief of the hypocrites. This woman ransomed her divorce from her husband by giving him back what he gave her as dowry. (These are the limits of Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (Transgress them not) do not step beyond that which Allah has prohibited. (For whoso transgresseth Allah's limits) steps beyond them: (such are wrong-doers) harmful to themselves.\n"
