Most surely Allah has power over everything.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "The lightning almost takes away their vision. When the lightning brightens their surroundings, they walk and when it is dark, they stand still. Had God wanted, He could have taken away their hearing and their vision. God has power over all things.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_7": "the lightning wellnigh snatches away their sight; whensoever it gives them light, they walk in it, and when the darkness is over them, they halt; had God willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight. Truly, God is powerful over everything.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "The lightning almost snatcheth away their sight from them. As often as it flasheth forth for them they walk therein, and when it darkeneth against them they stand still.

        "TRANSLATION_9": "The lightning almost takes away their sight: whenever it flashes upon them, they walk on, but as soon as darkness falls around them, they stand still. Indeed, if God pleased, He could take away their hearing and their sight: God has power over all things.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_17": "[2:20] The lightning well-nigh, almost, snatches away their sight, that is, takes it away swiftly; whensoever it gives them light, they walk in it, in its light; and when the darkness is over them, they stop, that is, they stand still: a simile of the perturbation that the Qur\u2019\u0101nic arguments cause in their hearts, and of their acknowledging the truths of what they love to hear and recoiling from what they detest; had God willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight, that is, the exterior faculty, in the same way that He took away their inner one; Truly, God has power over all things, [that] He wills, as for example, His taking away of the above-mentioned.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(The lightning), i.e. fire, (almost snatcheth away their sight from them), i.e. from the unbelievers. Similarly, the exposition of the Qur'an almost snatched away their error. (As often as it flasheth forth), the lightening, (for them they walk therein) in the brightness of lightening, (and when it darkeneth against them they stand still) they remain in darkness. Likewise, when the hypocrites declared themselves to be believers, they went along with that which the believers went along with because their outward faith was accepted. But when they died, they remained in the darkness of the grave. (And if Allah willed, He could destroy their hearing), take away the thunder, (and their sight) the lightening. Likewise, if Allah willed, He could take away the hearing of the hypocrites and Jews through the rebukes and threats contained in the Qur'an, and He could also take away their sight through the exposition contained therein. (Indeed Allah is able to do all things) in terms of destroying their hearing and sight.\n"
