He said, 'I too give life and cause to die.' Ibrahim said, 'Allah makes the sun come from the East. Make it come from the West.' And the one who was a kafir was dumbfounded. Allah does not guide wrongdoing people.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Have you thought of the man who argued with Abraham about his Lord because God had given him a kingdom? When Abraham said: \"My Lord is the giver of life and death,\" he replied: \"I am the giver of life and death.\" And Abraham said: \"God makes the sun rise from the East; so you make it rise from the West,\" and dumbfounded was the infidel. God does not guide those who are unjust.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Have you not considered the case of the person who had an argument with Abraham as to `Whom Abraham acknowledged as his Lord?' The dispute arose because Allah had given him the kingship, (which had made him arrogant). When Abraham said, \"My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death,\" he answered, \"I give life and cause death.\" Then Abraham said, \"Well, Allah brings the sun from the east: just bring it from the west.\" At this the disbeliever was confounded: (yet he did not believe), for Allah does not show guidance to unjust people.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "(Muhammad), have you heard about the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord for His granting him authority? Abraham said, \"It is only my Lord who gives life and causes things to die.\" His opponent said, \"I also can give life and make things die.\" Abraham said, \"God causes the sun to come up from the East. You make it come from the West.\" Thus the unbeliever was confounded. God does not guide the unjust people.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Did you (O dear Prophet Mohammed \u2013 peace and blessings be upon him) not see him who argued with Ibrahim (Abraham) concerning his Lord, as Allah had given him the kingdom? When Ibrahim said, \u201cMy Lord is He Who gives life and causes death\u201d, he answered, \u201cI give life and cause death\u201d; Ibrahim said, \u201cSo indeed it is Allah Who brings the sun from the East \u2013 you bring it from the West!\u201d \u2013 the disbeliever was therefore baffled; and Allah does not guide the unjust.\n",

When Ibrahim said: My Lord is He who gives life and causes to die, he said: I give life and cause death.

        "TRANSLATION_10": "Bethinkest thou not of one who contended with Ibrahim concerning his Lord, because Allah had vouchsafed unto him dominion! When Ibrahim said: my Lord is He Who giveth life and causeth death, he said: give life and cause death. Ibrahim said: verily Allah bringeth the sun from the east, then bring it thou from the west.

Abraham said: \"My Lord is He Who Giveth life and death.\" He said: \"I give life and death\".

Nor doth Allah Give guidance to a people unjust.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_14": "Have you not seen he who argued with Abraham about his Lord that Allah had given him the kingship! When Abraham said: 'My Lord is He who revives, and causes to die' He said: 'I revive, and cause to die' Abraham said: 'Allah brings up the sun from the east; so you bring it from the west' Then he who disbelieved became pale.

When Abraham said, \"My Lord is the one who gives life and causes death,\" he said, \"I give life and cause death.\" Abraham said, \"Indeed, Allah brings up the sun from the east, so bring it up from the west.\" So the disbeliever was overwhelmed [by astonishment], and Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[2:258] Have you not seen him who disputed with Abraham, concerning his Lord, because of the fact, that God had given him the kingship?, that is, his arrogance towards this very grace of God: this was Nimrod (Nimr\u016bd). When (idh is a substitution for h\u0101jja, \u2018disputed\u2019) Abraham, in response to the other\u2019s question, \u2018Who is this Lord of yours to whom you are calling us?\u2019, said: \u2018My Lord is He who gives life, and makes to die\u2019, the One that creates life and death in bodies; he [Nimrod] said, \u2018I give life, by sparing, and make to die\u2019, by killing. He then had two men brought before him, killed one and spared the other. When Abraham realised that this man was a fool, Abraham, resorting to a more sophisticated argument, said: \u2018God brings the sun from the east; so bring, you, it from the west.\u2019 Then the disbeliever was confused, perplexed and amazed; and God   guides not the folk who do evil, disbelieving, to the art of argument.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Bethink thee) have you not been informed (of him who had an argument with Abraham about his Lord) about the Religion of his Lord, (because Allah had given him the kingdom) he is Nimrod Ibn Canaan; (how, when Abraham said: My Lord is He Who giveth life and causeth death) gives life upon the resurrection and causes death by ending the life of this world, (he answered: I give life and cause death. Abraham said) give me proof of what you say. So Nimrod brought two prisoners, killed one and spared the other and then said: this is my proof. When he saw this, Abraham said: (Lo! Allah causeth the sun to rise in the East) from the direction of the East, (so do thou cause it to come up from the West) from the direction of the West. (Thus was the disbeliever abashed) the one who disbelieved kept quiet and could not argue. (And Allah guideth not) to the right argument (wrong-doing folk) the unbelievers, referring here to Nimrod.\n"
