The disbelievers reviled them for making fighting lawful in a sacred month, and so God revealed the following: They ask you about the sacred, the forbidden, month, and fighting in it (qit\u0101lin f\u012bhi, \u2018fighting in it\u2019, is an inclusive substitution [for al-shahri l-har\u0101mi, \u2018the sacred month\u2019]). Say, to them: \u2018Fighting (qit\u0101lun is the subject) in it is a grave thing (kab\u012br, \u2018grave\u2019, is the predicate), that is, heinous in terms of sin; but to bar (saddun is the subject), people, from God\u2019s way, His religion, and disbelief in Him, in God, and, to bar from, the Sacred Mosque, that is, Mecca, and to expel its people, the Prophet (s) and the believers, from it \u2014 that is graver (the predicate of the [last] subject), [that is] more heinous in terms of sin than fighting in it, in God\u2019s sight; and sedition, your idolatry, is graver than, your, slaying\u2019, in it. They, the disbelievers, will not cease to fight against you, O believers, until, so that, they turn you from your religion, to unbelief, if they are able; and whoever of you turns from his religion, and dies disbelieving \u2014 their, good, works have failed, that is, they are invalid, in this world and the Hereafter. Thus they will not count for anything and will not result in any reward. The specification of death as a condition is because if that person were to return to Islam [again], his original deeds would not be invalidated, and he will be rewarded for them, and he would not have to repeat them, [deeds] such as [performing] the Pilgrimage: al-Sh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b is of this opinion.
