Jerusalem], or [it was revealed] when the idolaters barred the Prophet (s) from entering Mecca in the year of the battle of Hudaybiyya; such men might never enter them, save in fear (ill\u0101 kh\u0101\u2019if\u012bna is a predicate, also functioning as a command, that is to say, \u2018Frighten them by threats of waging war against them, so that not one of them shall enter it feeling secure\u2019); for them in this world is degradation, debasement through being killed, taken captive and forced to pay the jizya; and in the Hereafter a mighty chastisement, namely, the Fire.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Then He mentioned Tatus Ibn Asipanos al-Rumi, king of the Christians who destroyed Jerusalem, saying: (And who doth greater wrong) in his disbelief (than he who forbideth the approach to the sanctuaries of Allah) Jerusalem (lest His name should be mentioned therein) by declaring Allah's Oneness and calling to prayer, (and striveth for their ruin?) in the ruin of Jerusalem by throwing carrions in it. And this lasted until the reign of 'Umar. (As for such) for the Romans, (it was never meant that they should enter them) Jerusalem (except in fear) hiding from the believers for fear of being killed, for they would be killed if found. (Theirs in the world is ignominy) a chastisement in that their cities, Constantinople, Amorium ('Ammuriyyah) and Rome (Rumiyyah) would be ruined (and theirs in the Hereafter is an awful doom) more severe than the punishment they were subjected to in this world.\n"
