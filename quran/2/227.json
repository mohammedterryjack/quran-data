This verse was revealed about a man who swore not to have sex with his wife for four months or longer. If this man had honoured his oath, his wife would have been considered divorced from him, one single act of divorce; if, on the other hand, he had sex with her before the elapse of this period, he should make amends for breaking his oath.\n"
