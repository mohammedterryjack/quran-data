        "TRANSLATION_0": "When your Lord said to the angels, 'I am putting a khalif on the earth,' they said, 'Why put on it one who will cause corruption on it and shed blood when we glorify You with praise and proclaim Your purity?' He said, 'I know what you do not know.'",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Remember, when your Lord said to the angels: \"I have to place a trustee on the earth,\" they said: \"Will You place one there who would create disorder and shed blood, while we intone Your litanies and sanctify Your name?\" And God said: \"I know what you do not know.\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Just recall the time when your Lord said to the angels, \"I am going to appoint a vicegerent on the Earth.\" They humbly enquired, \"Are you going to appoint such a one as will cause disorder and shed blood on the Earth? We are already engaged in hymning Your praise, and hallowing Your name\".\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "When your Lord said to the angels, \"I am appointing someone as my deputy on earth,\" they said (almost protesting), \"Are you going to appoint one who will commit corruption and bloodshed therein, even though we (are the ones who) commemorate Your Name and glorify You?\" The Lord said, \"I know that which you do not know\".\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels, \u201cI am about to place My Caliph in the earth\u201d; they said, \u201cWill You place (as a caliph) one who will spread turmoil in it and shed blood?

        "TRANSLATION_17": "[2:30] And, mention, O Muhammad (s), when your Lord said to the angels, \u2018I am appointing on earth a vicegerent\u2019, who shall act as My deputy, by implementing My rulings therein \u2014 and this [vicegerent] was Adam; They said, \u2018What, will You appoint therein one who will do corruption therein, through disobedience, and shed blood, spilling it through killing, just as the progeny of the jinn did, for they used to inhabit it, but when they became corrupted God sent down the angels against them and they were driven away to islands and into the mountains; while we glorify, continuously, You with praise, that is, \u201cWe say Glory and Praise be to You\u201d, and sanctify You?\u2019, that is, \u2018We exalt You as transcendent above what does not befit You?; the l\u0101m [of laka, \u2018You\u2019] is extra, and the sentence [wa-nuqaddisu laka, \u2018We sanctify You\u2019] is a circumstantial qualifier, the import being, \u2018thus, we are more entitled to be Your vicegerents\u2019); He, exalted be He, said, \u2018Assuredly, I know what you know not\u2019, of the benefits of making Adam a vicegerent and of the fact that among his progeny will be the obedient and the transgressor, and justice will prevail between them. They said, \u2018God will never create anything more noble in His eyes than us nor more knowledgeable, since we have been created before it and have seen what it has not seen. God then created Adam from the surface of the earth (ad\u012bm al-ard [ad\u012bm literally means \u2018skin\u2019]), taking a handful of all its colours and mixing it with different waters, then made him upright and breathed into him the Spirit and he thus became a living being with senses, after having been inanimate.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Then Allah, Exalted is He, mentioned the story of the angels who were commanded to prostrate to Adam, saying: (And when your Lord said unto the angels) who were already on the earth: (Lo! I am about to place a vicegerent in the earth), I am creating a vicegerent from the earth, (they said: Wilt Thou place therein), will you create therein (one who will do harm therein) by committing sin (and will shed blood) through transgression, (while we, we hymn Thy praise), pray following Your command (and sanctify Thee) and mention you in a state of purity? (He said: Surely I know that) which shall ensue from this vicegerent (which you know not).\n"
