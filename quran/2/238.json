Hanbal] and others; it is also said to mean \u2018in silence\u2019 [s\u0101kit\u012bn], on the basis of a had\u012bth of Zayd b. Arqam, in which he said, \u2018We used to speak to each other sometimes during prayer, but when this was revealed, we were commanded to be silent and were forbidden to talk\u2019, as reported by the two Shaykhs [Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim].\n",
