        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And make not Allah, by your oaths, a hindrance) a reason by means of which you make your oaths. This 38 was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Rawahah who swore not to show kindness to his sister and her husband and not to speak with them or make up between them. But Allah warned him against doing so, saying: do not make Allah a reason by means of which you make oaths, (to your being righteous) that you should not honour your oath (and observing your duty unto Him) and ward off severing ties of kinship (and making peace) and not make peace (among mankind). He says: return to that which is better for you and make amend for your oaths; it is also said that this means: avoid making oaths by Allah about not showing kindness to anyone and your not making peace between people. (For Allah is Hearer) of your oath to stop showing kindness to people, (Knower) of your intentions and the amends that will absolve you from your oaths.\n"
