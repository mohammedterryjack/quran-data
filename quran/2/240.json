The testament mentioned here was abrogated by the \u2018inheritance\u2019 verse [Q. 4:12], and the waiting of one year [without expulsion] was abrogated by the previous verse four months and ten [Q. 2:234] which was revealed later. In the opinion of al-Sh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b, may God have mercy on him, the habitation remains hers.\n",

This, i.e. the sustenance due on the deceased towards any wife he leaves behind, was however abrogated by her inheritance. (Allah is Mighty) for He is vengeful towards any that leaves what He has commanded, (Wise) in that He abrogated apportioning a year of sustenance and habitation to the wife whose husband is deceased and substituted it with what is due to her of inheritance: a quarter or eighth of the deceased's wealth.\n"
