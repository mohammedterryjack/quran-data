If you were to follow their whims, the ones to which they summon you, after the knowledge, the revelation, that has come to you, then you, if, hypothetically, you were to follow them, will surely be among the evildoers.\n",

(And if thou shouldst follow their desires) after being warned and pray towards their Qiblah (after the knowledge which hath come unto you) that the Sacred Precinct is the Qiblah of Abraham, (then surely) if you do that then surely (wert thou of the evil-doers) who harm themselves. 24\n"
