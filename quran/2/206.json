This verse was revealed about al-Akhnas Ibn Shurayq who was both eloquent and good looking and the Prophet (pbuh) used to like his speech. This person used to say to him that he loved him and that he was entirely with him in secret and in the open, and used to give his oath to this effect. But he was a hypocrite and it is alleged that he burned someone's crops and killed a donkey belonging to others.\n"
