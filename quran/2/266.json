        "TRANSLATION_17": "[2:266] Would any of you wish to have a garden, an orchard, of date-palms and vines, with rivers flowing beneath it, for him there is in it all manner of fruit, then old age smites him, and makes him too weak to profit from it, and he has seed, but they are weak, young children who cannot manage it; then a whirlwind (i\u2018s\u0101r are violent winds) with fire smites it, and it is consumed?, so that he loses what he is most in need of, and now he and his children have become incapacitated, confused, without any resources. This is a similitude of how the expenditure of the one expending for show, or the one who reproaches [after having expended], vanishes and how it is of no avail when he will be most in need of it in the Hereafter (the interrogative [ayawaddu, \u2018would any wish\u2019] is intended as a denial). According to Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s, this is the person who performs deeds of obedience, but when Satan comes to him, he begins to work disobedience, until all his good deeds have been consumed. So, in the way that He has explained what has been mentioned, God makes clear the signs to you, so that you might reflect, and take heed.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Would any of you like) wish (to have a garden of palm-trees and vines, with rivers flowing beneath it) under its trees, houses and rooms, (with all kinds of fruit for him therein) in the garden; (and old age hath stricken him and he hath feeble offspring) who cannot fend for themselves; (and a fiery whirlwind) a strong cold or hot wind (striketh it) i.e. the garden (and it is (all) consumed by fire. Thus Allah maketh plain His revelations) His signs through commands and prohibitions (unto you, in order that you may give thought) so that you may reflect on the similes of the Qur'an. This is also like the unbelievers in the Hereafter, they shall have no power neither will they be able to come back to the life of this world just as a person advanced in age is without strength and cannot revert to his former vigour and youth.\n"
