Rather devoutness is possessed by those who have taqwa. So come to houses by their doors and have taqwa of Allah, so that hopefully you will be successful.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "They ask you of the new moons. Say: \"These are periods set for men (to reckon) time, and for pilgrimage.\" Piety does not lie in entering the house through the back door, for the pious man is he who follows the straight path. Enter the house through the main gate, and obey God. You may haply find success.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "They ask you about the phases of the moon. Say, \"These are signs for the people to reckon dates and fix the periods for hajj.\" Also tell them, \"It is no virtue to enter your houses from their backs during the Hajj days); real virtue is that one should refrain from incurring the displeasure of Allah; so enter your houses by their proper doors. and fear Allah so that you may gain (true) success.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "(Muhammad), they ask you about the different phases of the moon. Tell them that they are there to indicate to people the phases of time and the pilgrimage season. It is not a righteous act to enter houses from the back. Righteousness is to be pious and enter the houses from the front door. Have fear of God so that perhaps you will have lasting happiness.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "They ask you, (O dear Prophet Mohammed \u2013 peace and blessings be upon him), regarding the crescents; say, \u201cThey are indicators of time for mankind and for Hajj (the pilgrimage)\u201d; and it is not a virtue at all that you enter the houses by demolishing their back portions, but in reality virtue is piety; and enter the houses using their gates \u2013 and keep fearing Allah, hoping that you achieve success.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "They ask you (O Muhammad) about the crescents. Say: \"These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage.\" It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, etc.) that you enter the houses from the back, but Al-Birr is from Taqwa. So enter houses through their proper doors, and have Taqwa of Allah that you may be successful.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "They ask you concerning the new moon. Say: They are times appointed for (the benefit of) men, and (for) the pilgrimage; and it is not righteousness that you should enter the houses at their backs, but righteousness is this that one should guard (against evil); and go into the houses by their doors and be careful (of your duty) to Allah, that you may be successful.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "They will question thee concerning the new moons. Say: 'They are appointed times for the people, and the Pilgrimage.'

Say, \u2018They are timekeeping signs for the people and [for the sake of] hajj.\u2019 It is not piety that you enter houses from their rear; rather, piety is [personified by] one who is Godwary, and enter houses from their doors and be wary of Allah, so that you may be felicitous.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "They ask thee concerning the New Moons. Say: They are but signs to mark fixed periods of time in (the affairs of) men, and for Pilgrimage.

        "TRANSLATION_16": "They ask you, [O Muhammad], about the new moons. Say, \"They are measurements of time for the people and for Hajj.\" And it is not righteousness to enter houses from the back, but righteousness is [in] one who fears Allah. And enter houses from their doors. And fear Allah that you may succeed.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[2:189] They will ask you, O Muhammad (s), about the new moons (ahilla, plural of hil\u0101l): \u2018Why do they seem very thin, and then wax until they are full of light, and then wane again as at the first, and are not always the same, in the way that the sun is?\u2019 Say, to them: \u2018They are appointed times (maw\u0101q\u012bt is the plural of m\u012bq\u0101t) for the people, for them to know the times for sowing the land, for business, for their women\u2019s waiting periods, their fast and their breaking it, and the Pilgrimage\u2019 (wa\u2019l-hajji and the Pilgrimage\u2019, is a supplement to li\u2019l-n\u0101si, \u2018for the people\u2019), that is to say, [appointed times] by which its season is known, for if they [the new moons] always looked the same, none of these things could be known. It is not piety to come to the houses from their backs, in [your] state of pilgrimage inviolability (ihr\u0101m), when you would bore holes in them to enter them and then exit, disregarding their doors; they used to do this and claim that it was out of piety; but piety is to fear, God by not contravening His commands; so come to the houses by their doors, when in a state of pilgrimage inviolability, and fear God, that you may prosper, [that you may] triumph.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(They ask thee (0 Muhammad), of new moons) they ask you about the increase and decrease of the moon. (Say) Muhammad! (They are fixed seasons for mankind) they are signs for people so that they pay back their debts and know the waiting periods of their women and the timing of their fast and the breaking of their fast (and for the pilgrimage) and for the timing of pilgrimage. This verse was revealed about Mu'adh Ibn Jabal when he asked the Prophet (pbuh) about the timing of the pilgrimage. (It is not righteousness) it is not an act of obedience or God-fearing (that ye go to houses by the backs thereof) during ritual consecration (ihram), (but the righteous man) the obedient person during the time of ritual consecration (is he who wardeth off (evil)) hunting and other things. (So go to the houses) enter the houses (by the gates thereof) by the gates you used to enter, (and observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah during the time of ritual consecration, (that ye may be successful) so that you will be spared Allah's wrath and punishment. This verse was revealed about a group of Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) from the tribes of Kinanah and Khuza'ah, who used to enter their houses, during the time of ritual consecration, from the back or from the roof, as was the habit during the pre-Islamic era.\n"
