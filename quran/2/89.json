The curse of God be on those who deny!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "And how are they behaving now towards a Book which has come to them from Allah? Inspite of the fact that it confirms the Scriptures which they already possessed. and, inspite of the fact that, before it came, they used to pray for a signal victory over the disbelievers, they rejected it when it came, although they recognized it. May Allah's curse be upon such disbelievers!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "When a Book came to them from God which confirms what is with them (the fact of truthfulness of the Prophet Muhammad in their Scripture), and, despite the fact that they had been praying for victory over the disbelievers (by the help of the truthful Prophet), they refuse to accept this book, even though they know it (to be the Truth). May God condemn those who hide the Truth!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And when the Book from Allah (the Holy Qu\u2019ran) came to them, which confirms the Book in their possession (the Taurat / Torah) \u2013 and before that they used to seek victory through the medium of this very Prophet (Mohammed \u2013 peace and blessings be upon him) over the disbelievers; so when the one whom they fully recognised (the Holy Prophet) came to them, they turned disbelievers \u2013 therefore Allah\u2019s curse is upon the disbelievers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "And when there came to them (the Jews), a Book (this Qur'an) from Allah confirming what is with them (the Tawrah) and the Injil (Gospel), although aforetime they had invoked Allah (for the coming of Muhammad) in order to gain victory over those who disbelieved, then when there came to them that which they had recognised, they disbelieved in it. So let the curse of Allah be on the disbelievers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "And when there came to them a Book from Allah verifying that which they have, and aforetime they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieve, but when there came to them (Prophet) that which they did not recognize, they disbelieved in him; so Allah's curse is on the unbelievers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "When there came to them a Book from God, confirming what was with them -- and they aforetimes prayed for victory over the unbelievers -- when there came to them that they recognized, they disbelieved in it; and the curse of God is on the unbelievers.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And when there cometh unto them a Scripture from Allah, confirming that in their possession) which accords with that which is in their possession (though before that) before Muhammad (pbuh) (they were asking for a signal triumph) through Muhammad and the Qur'an (over those who disbelieved) of their enemies: the tribes of Asad, Ghatafan, Muzaynah, and Juhaynah (and when there cometh unto them that which they knew) of his traits and description in their Book (they disbelieved therein) they denied it was him. (The curse of Allah) His wrath and torment (is on disbelievers) the Jews. 15\n"
