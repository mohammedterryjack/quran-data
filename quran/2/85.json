What repayment will there be for any of you who do that except disgrace in this world? And on the Day of Rising, they will be returned to the harshest of punishments. Allah is not unaware of what ytheyou do.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "But you still kill one another, and you turn a section of your people from their homes, assisting one another against them with guilt and oppression. Yet when they are brought to you as captives you ransom them, although forbidden it was to drive them away. Do you, then, believe a part of the Book and reject a part? There is no other award for them who so act but disgrace in the world, and on the Day of Judgement the severest of punishment; for God is not heedless of all that you do.\n",

Then is it only a part of the Book that ye believe in, and do ye reject the rest? but what is the reward for those among you who behave like this but disgrace in this life?- and on the Day of Judgment they shall be consigned to the most grievous penalty.

Qurayza had allied themselves with the Aws, and the Nad\u012br with the Khazraj, but every member of an alliance would fight against a fellow ally, thus destroying each other\u2019s homes and expelling one another, taking prisoners and then ransoming them. When they were asked: \u2018Why do you fight them and then pay their ransom?\u2019, they would reply, \u2018Because we have been commanded to ransom\u2019; and they would be asked, \u2018So, why do you fight them then?\u2019, to which they would say, \u2018For fear that our allies be humiliated\u2019; God, exalted, says: What, do you believe in part of the Book, that is, the part about ransom, and disbelieve in part?, namely, the part about renouncing fighting, expulsion and assistance [against one another]; What shall be the requital of those of you who do that, but degradation, disgrace and ignominy, in the life of this world: they were disgraced when Qurayza were slewn and the Nad\u012br were expelled to Syria, and ordered to pay the jizya; and on the Day of Resurrection to be returned to the most terrible of chastisement? And God is not heedless of what you do (ta\u2018mal\u016bna, or read ya\u2018mal\u016bna, \u2018they do\u2019).\n",

(Believe ye in part of the Scripture) the part that stipulates freeing your captives from the enemy (and disbelieve ye in part thereof?) and leave the captives of your friends without ransoming them. It is also said that this verse means: do you believe in those parts of the scripture that suit your whim and disbelieve in those parts that do not? (And what is the reward of those who do so save ignominy in the life of the world) by being killed or captured as slaves, (and on the Day of Resurrection they will be consigned to the most grievous doom.
