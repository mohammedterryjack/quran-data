        "TRANSLATION_0": "To those who are kafir, the life of this world is painted in glowing colours and they laugh at those who have iman. But on the Day of Rising those who fear Allah will be over them. Allah provides for whomever He wills without any reckoning.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Enamoured are the unbelievers of the life of this world, and scoff at the faithful. But those who keep from evil and follow the straight path will have a higher place than they on the Day of Reckoning; for God gives in measure without number whomsoever He will.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "This worldly life has been made very charming and alluring for those who have adopted the way of disbelief. So they mock at those who have adopted the way of belief, but (they forget that) the pious people will rank above them on the Day of Resurrection. As to the wordly provisions, Allah has full authority and power to bestow these without measure on anyone He wills.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "The worldly life is made to seem attractive to the disbelievers who scoff at the faithful, but the pious, in the life hereafter, will have a position far above them. God grants sustenance (without account) to anyone He wants.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_6": "The life of this world is made to seem fair to those who disbelieve, and they mock those who believe, and those who guard (against evil) shall be above them on the day of resurrection; and Allah gives means of subsistence to whom he pleases without measure.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "Decked out fair to the unbelievers is the present life, and they deride the believers; but those who were godfearing shall be above them on the Resurrection Day; and God provides whomsoever He will without reckoning.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Beautified is the life of the world for those who disbelieve; they make a jest of the believers. But those who keep their duty to Allah will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. Allah giveth without stint to whom He will.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "The life of this world is made to appear attractive for those who deny the truth and they scoff at those who believe. But those who fear God shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection: God bestows His bounties on whoever He pleases without stinting.\n",

Y\u0101sir], and Suhayb [al-R\u016bm\u012b], mocking them and treating them condescendingly with their wealth; but those who fear, idolatry, namely, those mentioned, shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection; and God sustains whomever He will without reckoning, with ample sustenance in the Hereafter or in this world, when He gives to those that were mocked possession of the property and lives of those that mocked them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Beautified is the life of the world) what is in this world of comfortable living (for those who disbelieve) Abu Jahl and his entourage; (they make a jest of believers) Salman [al-Farisi], Bilal [Ibn Rabah], Suhayb [al- Rumi] and their fellow believers because of their abject poverty. (But those who ward off) disbelief and ascribing partners to Allah: i.e. Salman and his fellow believers (will be above them) in this world by having a strong argument against them and also by having status and standing (on the Day of Resurrection. Allah giveth) abundant wealth (without stint) without faltering or affectation; it is also said that He gives to whoever He wills in Paradise without stint (to whom He will).\n"
