Whatever good you do, by way of voluntary almsgiving, God knows it, and will reward you for it. And take provision, to suffice you your journey: this was revealed regarding the people of Yemen, who use to make the Pilgrimage and not take any provisions with them, thus, becoming a burden for others. But the best provision is piety [taqw\u0101, \u2018piety\u2019, literally \u2018guarding\u2019] with which you are able to guard against asking others [for things]; and fear you Me, O people of pith!, [O] possessors of intellect.\n",

(And whatsoever good ye do) whatever you abstain from whether it is lewdness, abuse or angry conversation in the Sacred Precinct (Allah knoweth it) Allah will accept it. (So make provision for yourselves) people of sound minds, from the provision of this world; Allah says here: take from the provisions of this world, people of sound minds, what is enough to spare you from asking others, otherwise just trust in Allah; (for the best provision to ward off evil) for trust in Allah is the best provision in this world. (Therefore keep your duty unto Me) fear Me in the Sacred Precinct, (0 men of understanding). This verse was revealed about some people from the Yemen who used to perform the pilgrimage without taking any provisions with them. As a consequence, they used to wrongfully obtain provisions from the settlements they found on their way and hence Allah now prohibited them from doing so.\n"
