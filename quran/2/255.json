(He knoweth that which is in front of them) in front of the angels regarding the matter of the Hereafter and who is to intercede (and that which is behind them) of the life of this world, (while they encompass nothing of His knowledge save that He will). Allah says: the angels know nothing of the Hereafter or of the life of this world save that which Allah has taught them. (His throne includeth the heaven and the earth) He says that His Chair extends far beyond the heavens and the earth, (and He is never weary of preserving them) it is not burdensome for Him to preserve the Throne and Chair without the angels.
