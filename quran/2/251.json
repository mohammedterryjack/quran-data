If it were not for Allah's driving some people back by means of others, the earth would have been corrupted. But Allah shows favour to all the worlds.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "By the will of God they defeated them, and David killed Goliath, and God gave him kingship and wisdom, and taught him whatsoever He pleased. If God did not make men deter one another this earth would indeed be depraved. But gracious is God to the people of the world.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Consequently, by Allah's grace, they routed the unbelievers, and David killed Goliath; and Allah gave him kingship and wisdom and taught him whatever other things He willed. And if Allah had not been repelling one set of people by means of another, the earth would have been filled with chaos. But Allah is bountiful to the world (and so repels chaos in this way).\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "They defeated their enemy through God's will. David slew Goliath and God granted David the kingdom and wisdom and also taught him whatever He wanted. Had God not made one group of people repel the other, the earth would have become full of corruption, but God is generous to His creatures.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "So they routed them by the command of Allah; and Dawud (David) slew Jalut, and Allah gave him the kingdom and wisdom, and taught him all whatever He willed; and if Allah does not ward off some men by others, the earth will be destroyed, but Allah is Most Munificent towards the entire creation.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "So they routed them by Allah's leave and Dawud (David) killed Jalut (Goliath), and Allah gave him (Dawud) the kingdom [after the death of Talut and Samuel] and Al-Hikmah (prophethood), and taught him of that which He willed.

        "TRANSLATION_18": "(So they routed them by Allah's leave) by Allah's help (and David) the Prophet (slew Goliath) the unbeliever; (and Allah gave him the kingdom) Allah gave David sovereignty over the Children of Israel (and wisdom) understanding and prophethood, (and taught him of that which He willeth) i.e. how to make armour. (And if Allah had not repelled some men by others) as He repelled through David the evil of Goliath from the Children of Israel (the earth would have been corrupted). He says: Allah repelled from the believers, by means of the prophets, the evil of their enemies, and He repelled from those who refrained from participating in the fight for Allah's sake, by means of those who fought in His sake, the evil of their enemies. If it were not thus, the earth would have been corrupted. (But Allah is a Lord of Kindness to all the worlds) by this repelling.\n"
