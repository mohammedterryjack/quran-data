When heavy rain fell on it, the whole of the soil washed away and the rock was left bare Such people do not gain the reward they imagine they have earned by their seeming charity; Allah does not show the Right Way to the ungrateful.\n",

(His likeness) the likeness of the person who reminds others about what he has given them and the alms given by one who associates partners with Allah (is as the likeness of rock whereon is dust of earth; a rainstorm smiteth it, leaving it smooth and bare) without any dust on it. (They have no control of aught) to obtain a reward for anything in the Hereafter (of that which they have gained) that which they have spent in the life of this world. Allah says here: the reward of the person who boasts about what he has spent on alms and of the person who hurts those he gives alms to, is like dust on a rock when rain pours down on it and no dust remains. (Allah guideth not) rewards not (the disbelieving folk) and also those who show off their spending while still associating partners with Allah, just as He does not reward the alms of those who remind others about what they have spent on them.\n"
