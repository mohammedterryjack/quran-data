Say, to them: \u2018In both, that is, in the partaking of both, is great sin (a variant reading [for kab\u012br, \u2018great\u2019] has kath\u012br, \u2018much\u2019) because of the fighting, cursing and swearing that ensue from it; and profit for men, by way of delight and enjoyment in wine, and acquiring money effortlessly from gambling; but the sin in them, that is, the degenerate behaviour in which they result, is greater, graver, than the usefulness\u2019. When this verse was revealed, some gave up drinking, while others persisted, until the verse of s\u016brat al-M\u0101\u2019ida [Q. 5:90-91]   finally made it illicit. And they will ask you what, that is to say, how much, they should expend. Say, expend, \u2018Comfortably\u2019 (al-\u2018afwa [in the accusative] is also read in the nominative, al-\u2018afwu, implying a preceding huwa), that is, the surplus of your need, and do not expend what you need, ruining yourselves. So, just as He explained to you what has been mentioned, God makes clear His signs to you that you might reflect,\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(They question thee about strong drink and games of chance). This was revealed about 'Umar Ibn al- Khattab who prayed: \"0 Allah! Show us Your judgement regarding alcoholic drinks!\" So Allah said to Muhammad (pbuh): (Say) Muhammad! (in both is great sin) this is after they were declared unlawful, (and (some) utility for men) by means of their trading, i.e. before they were unlawful; (but the sin of them) after their being declared unlawful (is greater than their usefulness) before they were made unlawful; and then both were prohibited. (And they ask thee what they ought to spend). This was revealed about 'Amr Ibn al-Jamuh who asked the Prophet (pbuh): \"What should we spend from our wealth\". Allah told His Prophet: they ask you about what they should spend from their wealth. (Say: That which is superfluous) that which is in surplus to your sustenance requirements and of food for your dependents. But this was abrogated by 37 those verses on the poor-due. (Thus Allah maketh plain to you (the) revelations) the commands and prohibitions and the insignificance of this world, (that ye may reflect) that it is evanescent.\n"
