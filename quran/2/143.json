        "TRANSLATION_1": "We have made you a temperate people that you act as witness over man, and the Prophet as witness over you. We decreed the Qiblah which you faced before that We may know who follow the Apostle and who turn away in haste. And this was a hard (test) except for those who were guided by God.

We had appointed the former giblah towards which you used to turn your face merely to test who would follow the Messenger and who would turn back. It was indeed a hard test but not for those who had been blessed with Guidance from Allah.

The direction which you had been facing during your prayers (the qibla) was only made in order that We would know who would follow the Messenger and who would turn away. It was a hard test but not for those to whom God has given guidance. God did not want to make your previous prayers worthless; God is Compassionate and All-merciful.\n",

And We made the Qiblah which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e., disobey the Messenger). Indeed it was great (heavy, difficult) except for those whom Allah guided. And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e., your prayers offered towards Jerusalem). Truly, Allah is full of kindness, the Most Merciful towards mankind.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_12": "Thus, have We made of you an Ummat justly balanced, that ye might be witnesses over the nations, and the Messenger a witness over yourselves; and We appointed the Qibla to which thou wast used, only to test those who followed the Messenger from those who would turn on their heels (From the Faith). Indeed it was (A change) momentous, except to those guided by Allah. And never would Allah Make your faith of no effect. For Allah is to all people Most surely full of kindness, Most Merciful.\n",

And We made the Qiblah (prayer direction towards Jerusalem) which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e. disobey the Messenger). Indeed it was great (heavy) except for those whom Allah guided. And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered towards Jerusalem). Truly, Allah is full of kindness, the Most Merciful towards mankind.\n",

We did not change the direction that you were facing except that We might know who followed the Messenger from him who turned on both his heels. Though it was a hardship except for those whom Allah has guided. But Allah would never waste your faith. Indeed, Allah is Gentle with people, the Most Merciful.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "Thus We made you a moderate community, that you may be witnesses to humanity, and that the Messenger may be a witness to you.

And indeed, it is difficult except for those whom Allah has guided. And never would Allah have caused you to lose your faith. Indeed Allah is, to the people, Kind and Merciful.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[2:143] Thus, in the same way that We guided you to it, We appointed you, O community of Muhammad (s), a midmost community, excellent and upright, that you might be witnesses to the people, on the Day of Resurrection, that their messengers delivered [the Message] to them; and that the Messenger might be a witness to you, that he delivered [the Message] to you, and We did not appoint, make, the direction, for you now, the direction, you were facing, that is the Ka\u2018ba: the Prophet (s) used to face it in prayer, but when he emigrated he was commanded to face the Holy House [of Jerusalem], in order to win the hearts of the Jews. He prayed in this direction for sixteen or seventeen months before he changed direction; except that We might know, [that it become] manifest knowledge, who followed the Messenger, and believed in him, from him who turned on his heels, and returned to unbelief doubting the religion and thinking that the Prophet (s) was confused about this issue; and a number of them apostatised as a result of this\u2014 though it, the change of direction, were (wa-in, \u2018though\u2019, is softened, and its noun apocopated, originally being: wa-innah\u0101) a grave thing, troublesome for people, save for those, of them, whom God has guided; but God would never cause your faith, that is, your prayers towards the Holy House [of Jerusalem], to be wasted, but He will reward you for them (the reason that this [verse] was revealed was that some had asked about the status of those that had died before the change of direction [of prayer]); truly, God is Gentle with, believing, people, Merciful, when He does not let their deeds go to waste (al-ra\u2019fa means \u2018intensity of mercy\u2019, and is mentioned first to allow for the end rhyme of the verse [with the preceding one]).\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Thus) i.e. just as we have honoured you with the Religion of Abraham (Islam) and his direction of prayer (We have appointed you a middle nation) a middlemost community, (that you be witnesses) for the prophets (over mankind, and that the Messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (may be a witness over you) that you are upright and follow the straight path. (And We appointed) changed (the Qiblah which ye formerly observed) prayed towards for a period of 19 months (only that We might know) see and distinguish (him who followeth the Messenger) concerning the Qiblah, (from him who turneth) reverts (on his heels) to his former religion and direction of prayer. (In truth it) the changing of the Qiblah (was a hard (test) save for those whom Allah guided) whose hearts Allah had protected. (But it was not Allah's purpose that your faith should be in vain) that He thwarts your faith as it was prior to the abrogation of legal rulings; and it is also said that this means: it is not Allah's purpose to thwart your faith but rather His purpose is to abrogate the legal rulings which conduct your faith; and it is also said that this means: Allah did not thwart your prayers towards Jerusalem but He has abrogated the ruling which required you to pray towards Jerusalem, (for Allah is full of pity, Merciful) in that He does not thwart your faith as it was before the abrogation of legal rulings (towards mankind) towards the believers.\n"
