He, the prophet, said, to them: \u2018Might it be that (\u2018asaytum, or \u2018as\u012btum) if fighting is prescribed for you, you will not fight? (all\u0101 tuq\u0101til\u016b is the predicate of \u2018as\u0101, \u2018might it be\u2019; the interrogative is intended to confirm the expectation that follows [sc. that they will not fight]). They said, \u2018Why should we not fight in God\u2019s way, when we have been expelled from our habitations and our children?\u2019, as a result of these latter being taken captive or killed, that which they suffered at the hands of Goliath and his men. The meaning is, \u2018There is nothing to stop us fighting, provided the requirement [we demanded] is forthcoming\u2019. God, exalted be He, says, Yet when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned their backs, from fighting in cowardice, except a few of them, the ones that crossed the river with Saul (T\u0101l\u016bt), as will be mentioned; and God has knowledge of the evildoers, and will requite them accordingly. The prophet then asked his Lord to send forth a king, and God responded by sending forth Saul.\n",

(He said: Would ye then) do you suppose then that you will (refrain from fighting if fighting) against your enemy (were prescribed for you?) made obligatory upon you. (They said: why should we not fight in Allah's way when we have been expelled from our dwellings) from our homes (and separated from our children) who were taken as slaves? (Yet, when fighting was prescribed for them) was made obligatory upon them, (they turned away) they refrained from fighting their enemy, (all save a few of them) 313 men. (And Allah is Aware of evil-doers) who shy away from fighting their enemy.\n"
