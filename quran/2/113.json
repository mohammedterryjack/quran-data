Thus, in the way that these have said, the ignorant, from among the Arabs and others, say the like of what these say (this last phrase [mithla qawlihim, \u2018the like of what they say\u2019] is the explication of dh\u0101lika, \u2018that [way]\u2019): that is to say, to every person of religion they would say, \u2018You have no basis\u2019; God shall decide between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences, in religion and will admit the confirmer into Paradise and the falsifier into the Fire.1568039483\n",

(Even thus spoke those who know not) knew the Oneness of Allah through their own forefathers; and it is said this means: they knew the Book of Allah from others. (Allah will judge between them) between the Jews and Christians (on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ).\n"
