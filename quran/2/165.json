The general meaning [of the verse] then is: \u2018If they were aware in this world of the severity of God\u2019s chastisement and of the fact that power is God\u2019s alone, the moment they come to see it with their own eyes, on the Day of Resurrection, they would not take to themselves compeers\u2019.\n",
