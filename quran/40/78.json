And it was never [permitted] for any messenger, from among them, to bring a sign except with God\u2019s permission, for they are [also] servants enthralled [by Him]. Hence when God\u2019s command comes, for the chastisement to be sent down on the disbelievers, judgement, between the messengers and their deniers, is passed justly; and it is thence that the advocates of falsehood become losers, that is to say, [it is thence that] the judgement and the loss become manifest for mankind, although such [advocates of falsehood] will have always been losers always before that.\n",
