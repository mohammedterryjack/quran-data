        "TRANSLATION_1": "Joseph had indeed come to you before with clear proofs, but you did not cease to doubt what he had brought until he died, when you said: 'God will not send a prophet after him.' That is how God leads the waster, the sceptic astray.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Verily Joseph came to you with Clear Signs before, yet you continued to doubt his Message. Thereafter when he died, you said: 'Allah shall send no Messenger after him.'\u201d Thus Allah leads astray those who transgress the limits and are given to much doubting;\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Joseph came to you before with illustrious evidence but you still have doubts about what he brought. When he passed away, you said, \"God will never send any Messenger after him.\" Thus does God causes to go astray the skeptical transgressing people,\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "\u201cAnd indeed Yusuf came to you with clear signs before this, thereupon you remained doubtful concerning what he had brought; to the extent that when he died, you said, \u2018Allah will surely not send any Noble Messenger after him\u2019\u201d; this is how Allah sends astray whoever transgresses, is doubtful. \u2013\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "And indeed Yusuf did come to you, in times gone by, with clear signs, but you ceased not to doubt in that which he did bring to you, till when he died, you said: \"No Messenger will Allah send after him.\" Thus Allah leaves astray him who is a transgressor and a skeptic.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "And certainly Yusuf came to you before with clear arguments, but you ever remained in doubt as to what he brought; until when he died, you said: Allah will never raise an apostle after him. Thus does Allah cause him to err who is extravagant, a doubter\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "Joseph brought you the clear signs before, yet you continued in doubt concerning that he brought you until, when he perished, you said, \"God will never send forth a Messenger after him.\" Even, so God leads astray the prodigal and the doubter.'\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "And verily Joseph brought you of old clear proofs, yet ye ceased not to be in doubt concerning what he brought you till, when he died, ye said: Allah will not send any messenger after him. Thus Allah deceiveth him who is a prodigal, a doubter.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "Joseph came to you before with clear signs, but you never ceased to doubt the message he brought you. When he died, you said, 'God will not send another messenger.'\"\" In this way God leaves the transgressors and doubters to go astray --\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "And assuredly there came Unto you Yusuf aforetime with evidences, yet ye ceased not to be in doubt concerning that which he brought Unto you, until when he died, ye said: God shall by no means raise an apostle after him.

When he died, you said, \u2018\u2018Allah will never send any apostle after him.\u2019\u2019 That is how Allah leads astray those who are unrestrained and skeptical.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_14": "Before this, Joseph brought you clear signs, but you continued to be doubtful of that which he brought. When he passed away you said: \"Allah will never send another Messenger after him.\" As such Allah leads astray the sinner, the doubter.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "Joseph had come to you with clear revelations, but you continued to doubt what he came to you with. Until, when he perished, you said, \u201cGod will never send a messenger after him.\u201d Thus God leads astray the outrageous skeptic.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "And Joseph had already come to you before with clear proofs, but you remained in doubt of that which he brought to you, until when he died, you said, 'Never will Allah send a messenger after him.' Thus does Allah leave astray he who is a transgressor and skeptic.\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[40:34] And verily Joseph brought you, before, in other words, before Moses \u2014 according to one opinion, this Joseph is the son of Jacob, having been given life until the time of Moses; according to another opinion this is Joseph son of Abraham son of Joseph son of Jacob \u2014 clear signs, manifest miracles, but you continued to be in doubt concerning what he had brought you until, when he died, you said, without any evidence [to support such a claim]: \u201cGod will never send any messenger after him\u201d \u2014 in other words, you will never cease to disbelieve in Joseph and others [that may come after him]. So, that is, just as you have been led astray, God leads astray one who is a prodigal, an idolater, a skeptic\u2019, a doubter of that which the clear signs have certified.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And verily Joseph brought you) it is Ezekiel who said this (of old) before Moses (clear proofs) commands, prohibitions, the interpretation of dreams and the tearing off of his shirt, (yet ye ceased not to be in doubt concerning what he) Joseph (brought you till, when he died, ye said: Allah will not send any messenger after 543 him) after his death. (Thus Allah deceiveth) misguides from His religion (him who is a prodigal) an idolater, (a doubter) because of his idolatry.\n"
