But God, exalted be He, says: Without any doubt \u2014 verily \u2014 theirs shall be the Fire and they shall be abandoned therein, or [it, mufrat\u016bn, means that] they shall be foremost in [entering] it (a variant reading [for mufrat\u016bn] has mufrit\u016bn, meaning that \u2018they transgress the bounds\u2019).\n",
