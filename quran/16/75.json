        "TRANSLATION_0": "Allah does make a metaphor: an owned slave possessing no power over anything, and someone We have given plentiful provision who gives out from it secretly and openly. Are they the same? Praise be to Allah! They are not! But most people do not know it.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "God presents the example of a man who is a hired servant with no power over anything, and another on whom We have bestowed a handsome fortune, who spends from it in private and in public: Can they be equal? Praised be God! But most men do not understand.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Allah sets forth a parable: There is one who is a slave and is owned by another and has no power over anything; and there is one whom We have granted good provision Ourselves, of which he spends both secretly and openly. Can they be equal? All praise be to Allah. But most of them do not even know (this simple fact).\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "God tells a parable about a helpless servant and one to whom He has given honorable provisions and who has spent for the cause of God privately and in public. Can these two people be considered equal? It is only God who deserves all praise, but most people do not know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Allah has illustrated an example \u2013 there is a slave, himself the property of another, not owning anything \u2013 and another one upon whom We have bestowed a good livelihood from Us, he therefore spends from it, secretly and publicly; will they be equal? All praise is to Allah; in fact, most of them do not know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Allah gives the example of a servant under the possession of another, he has no power of any sort, and a man on whom We have bestowed good provisions from Us, and he spends from that secretly and openly. Can they be equal (By no means). All the praises and thanks are to Allah. Nay! (But) most of them know not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "Allah sets forth a parable: (consider) a slave, the property of another, (who) has no power over anything, and one whom We have granted from Ourselves a goodly sustenance so he spends from it secretly and openly; are the two alike? (All) praise is due to Allah! Nay, most of them do not know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "God has struck a similitude: a servant possessed by his master, having no power over anything, and one whom We have provided of Ourselves with a provision fair, and he expends of it secretly and openly. Are they equal? Praise belongs to God! Nay, most of them know not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Allah coineth a similitude: (on the one hand) a (mere) chattel slave, who hath control of nothing, and (on the other hand) one on whom we have bestowed a fair provision from Us, and he spendeth thereof secretly and openly. Are they equal? Praise be to Allah! But most of them know not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "God makes a comparison between an owned slave possessing no power over anything, and someone to whom We have given plentiful provision, who gives out from it privately and openly. Are they equal? Praise be to God! But most people do not know it.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "Allah propoundeth a similitude: there is a bondman enslaved who hath not power over aught; and there is one whom We have provided from Ourselves with goodly provision and he expendeth thereof secretly and openly; can they be equal? All praise Unto Allah; but most of them know not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "Allah draws a parable: a slave owned [by his master] who has no power over anything, and another one [a free man] whom We have provided a goodly provision and who spends out of it secretly and openly. Are they equal? All praise belongs to Allah. But most of them do not know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "Allah sets forth the Parable (of two men: one) a slave under the dominion of another; He has no power of any sort; and (the other) a man on whom We have bestowed goodly favours from Ourselves, and he spends thereof (freely), privately and publicly: are the two equal? (By no means;) praise be to Allah. But most of them understand not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "Allah puts forward the example (of two men a believer and a disbeliever); a slave (disbeliever) under the possession of another, he has no power of any sort, and (the other), a man (believer) on whom We have bestowed a good provision from Us, and He spends thereof secretly and openly. Can they be equal? (By no means, not). All the praises and thanks be to Allah. Nay! (But) most of them know not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "Allah strikes a parable. A servant owned by his master, having no power over anything, and one to whom We have given from Us a fine provision who spends it secretly and openly, are they equal? Praise be to Allah! No, most of them do not know!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "God cites the example of a bonded slave, who has no power over anything; and someone to whom We have given plentiful provision, from which he gives secretly and openly. Are they equal in comparison? All praise belongs to God, but most of them do not know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "Allah presents an example: a slave [who is] owned and unable to do a thing and he to whom We have provided from Us good provision, so he spends from it secretly and publicly. Can they be equal? Praise to Allah! But most of them do not know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[16:75] God strikes a similitude (mathalan, this is substituted by [the following, \u2018abdan maml\u016bkan]) a slave who is a chattel (maml\u016bkan, an adjective to distinguish him [this type of slave] from a free man, who is the servant of God [alone]) having no power over anything, since he has no mastery, and one on whom (man, is an indefinite [noun], adjectivally qualified, in other words, a free man) We have bestowed a fair provision from Us, such that he spends thereof secretly and openly, that is, disposing of it as he wishes: the first similitude is for the idols, while the second is His, exalted be He. Are they equal?, the powerless slaves and the dispensing free men? No. Praise belongs to God, alone. But most of them, that is, the people of Mecca, do not know, the chastisement they will come to, and so they associate others with God.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Allah then gave a parable regarding the believer and the disbeliever, saying: (Allah coineth a similitude: (on the one hand) a (mere) chattel slave) Allah explained the traits of this slave, (who hath control of nothing) he has no power to spend or do any good, and in this respect he is just like the disbeliever from whom no good ever comes, (and (on the other hand) one on whom We have bestowed a fair provision) abundant wealth (from Us, and he spendeth thereof secretly) between him and his Lord (and openly) between him and other people for the sake of Allah; this is the simile of the sincere believer. (Are they equal) in their reward and obedience? (Praise be to Allah!) gratitude is due to Allah and divine Oneness is also Allah's. (But most of them know not) the parable of the Qur'an. It is also said that this verse was revealed about 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan and an Arab man called Abu'l-'Is Ibn Umayyah.\n"
