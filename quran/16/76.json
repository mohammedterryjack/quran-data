Is he, that is, the dumb one mentioned, equal to one who enjoins justice, that is, to one who is able to speak, of benefit to people, since he enjoins it [justice] and encourages [others to] it, and follows a path, a way, that is straight? \u2014 this being the second [man], the believer \u2014 No [he is not equal to him]. It is also said that this [last similitude] is a similitude of God, while the [similitude of the] dumb one is of the idols, so that the preceding [verse] contains the similitude of the disbeliever and the believer.\n",

(Is he equal) in terms of bringing benefit and driving away harm, i.e. the idol (with one who enjoineth justice) the Oneness of Allah (and followeth a straight path) i.e. Allah's divine Oneness, meaning Allah?\n"
