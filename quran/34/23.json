And they remained in this state. (Yet, when fear is banished from their hearts) and Gabriel came down to them, and they lifted their heads, (they say) the angels said to Gabriel and the angels who were with him: (What was it that your Lord said) Gabriel? (They say) Gabriel and the angels with him say: (The Truth) the Qur'an. (And He is the Sublime) more sublime than anyone and anything, (the Great) greater than everyone and everything.\n"
