        "TRANSLATION_1": "Do they not see what is before them and what is behind them of the heavens and the earth? We could cleave the earth and sink them, if We pleased, or drop a fragment of the sky upon them. There is surely a sign in this for every penitent creature.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_3": "Have they not seen the heavens and the earth in front and behind them. Had We wanted, We could have caused the earth to swallow them up or made a part of the sky fall upon them. In this there is evidence (of the truth) for every repenting person.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "So did they not see what is before them and what is behind them in the sky and the earth? If We will, We can bury them into the earth or cause a part of the sky to fall on them; indeed in this is a sign for every repentant bondman.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_6": "Do they not then consider what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and the earth? If We please We will make them disappear in the land or bring down upon them a portion from the heaven; most surely there is a sign in this for every servant turning (to Allah).\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "Have they not regarded what lies before them and what lies behind them of heaven and earth? Did We will, We would make the earth to swallow them, or We would drop down on them lumps from heaven. Surely in that is a sign to every penitent servant.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Have they not observed what is before them and what is behind them of the sky and the earth? If We will, We can make the earth swallow them, or cause obliteration from the sky to fall on them. Lo! herein surely is a portent for every slave who turneth (to Allah) repentant.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "Do they not observe how they are encompassed by what is before them and what is behind them in heaven and on earth?

        "TRANSLATION_15": "Do they not reflect upon what lies before them and behind them, of the heaven and the earth? If We will, We can make the earth cave in beneath them, or make pieces of the sky fall down on them. In that is a sign for every devout servant.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "Then, do they not look at what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and earth? If We should will, We could cause the earth to swallow them or [could] let fall upon them fragments from the sky. Indeed in that is a sign for every servant turning back [to Allah].\n",

If We will [it], We can make the earth swallow them or let fall on them fragments (read kisfan or kisafan: \u2018large pieces\u2019) from the heaven (a variant reading has the third person singular for all three verbs [sc. yash\u0101\u2019, \u2018He will\u2019, yakhsif, \u2018He makes to swallow\u2019, yusqit, \u2018He lets fall\u2019]). Surely in that, which is observed, there is a sign for every penitent servant, turning back to his Lord, [signs] indicating God\u2019s power to resurrect and to do what He will.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Have they not observed) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (what is before them) what is above and below them of the sky and the earth (and what is behind them) and what is above and below them (of the sky and the earth? If We will, We can make the earth swallow them, or cause obliteration from the sky to fall on them) and thus destroy them. (Lo! herein) in what I have mentioned concerning the sky and the earth (surely is a portent) a lesson (for every slave who turneth (to Allah) repentant) who hastens to Allah and to His obedience.\n"
