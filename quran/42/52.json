        "TRANSLATION_3": "Thus, We have revealed a Spirit to you, (Muhammad), by Our command. Before, you did not even know what a Book or Faith was, but We have made the Quran as a light by which We guide whichever of Our servants We want. You certainly guide (people) to the right path,\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And this is how We sent the divine revelation to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed \u2013 peace and blessings be upon him) \u2013 a life giving thing, by Our command; neither did you know the Book nor the detailed commands of religion, but We have made this Qur\u2019an a light by which We guide whomever We will from Our bondmen; and indeed you surely do guide to the Straight Path.\n",

You did not know, before revelation came to you, what the Book was, [what] the Qur\u2019\u0101n [was], nor faith, that is, its ordinances and [ritual] ceremonies (the negation comments in place of the verb on the action, and what has come after it constitutes two direct objects); but We have made it, namely, the Spirit \u2014 or the Qur\u2019\u0101n \u2014 a light by which We guide whomever We will of Our servants. And verily you guide, you are summoning [people], by means of what is revealed to you, to a straight path, [a straight] way: the religion of Islam,\n",

(But We have made it) i.e. the Qur'an (a light) an exposition of commands and prohibitions, the lawful and unlawful, the Truth and falsehood (whereby) by means of the Qur'an (We guide whom We will) whoever deserves it (of Our bondmen. And lo! thou verily dost guide) do call (unto a right path) a straight, true religion.\n"
