        "TRANSLATION_3": "He has plainly clarified the religion which is revealed to you and that which Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus were commanded to follow (He has explained it) so that you would be steadfast and united in your religion.

        "TRANSLATION_6": "He has made plain to you of the religion what He enjoined upon Nuh and that which We have revealed to you and that which We enjoined upon Ibrahim and Musa and Isa that keep to obedience and be not divided therein; hard to the unbelievers is that which you call them to; Allah chooses for Himself whom He pleases, and guides to Himself him who turns (to Him), frequently.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "He has laid down for you as religion that He charged Noah with, and that We have revealed to thee, and that We charged Abraham with, Moses and Jesus: 'Perform the religion, and scatter not regarding it.

Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him).\n",

        "TRANSLATION_16": "He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus - to establish the religion and not be divided therein.

Dreadful is for the idolaters that to which you summon them, in the way of affirming the Oneness [of God]. God chooses for it, for the [task of] affirming [His] Oneness, whomever He will, and He guides to it whomever turns penitently, [whomever] applies himself to obedience of Him.\n",

(Dreadful for the idolaters) Abu Jahl and his host (is that unto which thou callest them) of Allah's divine Oneness and the Qur'an. (Allah chooseth for Himself) for His religion (whom He will) this he who is born a Muslim and dies as a Muslim, (and guideth unto Himself him who turneth (towards Him)) and guides to His religion whoever turns to Him of the disbelievers.\n"
