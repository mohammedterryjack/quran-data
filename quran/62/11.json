The following [verse] was then revealed: But when they sight some [opportunity for] business or a diversion, they scatter off towards it, that is, towards the business, since it is what they seek more than diversion, and leave you, during the sermon, standing. Say: \u2018That which is with God, in the way of reward, is better, for those who believe, than diversion and commerce. And God is the best of providers\u2019.

(Say) to them, Muhammad: (That which Allah hath) of reward (is better) for you (than pastime) the sound of the drum (and than merchandise) of Dihyah al-Kalbi; He says: if you had stayed with your Prophet and prayed behind him and then made supplications before leaving the mosque, that would have been better for you in terms of reward and bestowal of honour from Allah, and much better than leaving the mosque without doing this, (and Allah is the Best of providers) Allah is the best of those who give; i.e. say this when the hypocrites come to you'.
