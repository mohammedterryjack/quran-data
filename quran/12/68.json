        "TRANSLATION_0": "But when they entered as their father said, it did not save them from Allah at all. yet a need in Ya'qub's soul was satisfied. He had knowledge which We had taught him, but most of mankind simply do not know.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "When they entered as their father had advised them, nothing could avail them against (the will of) God, yet it confirmed a premonition Jacob had, for verily he had knowledge as We had taught him, though most men do not know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "And it so happened that when they entered the city (by many gates) as their father had directed them, this precautionary measure proved ineffective against Allah's will. There was an uneasiness in Jacob's soul which he so tried to remove. Surely he was possessed of knowledge owing to the knowledge that We bestowed upon him. But most people do not know the truth of the matter.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Even though they entered the town as their father had told them, it would not have been of any avail to them against the decree of God. It only served to satisfy Jacob's desire and judgment. He was certainly well versed by Our instruction, but most people do not know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And when they entered from the place where their father had commanded them to; that would not at all have saved them against Allah \u2013 except that it was Yaqub\u2019s secret wish, which he fulfilled; and indeed he is a possessor of knowledge, due to Our teaching, but most people do not know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "And when they entered according to their father's advice, it did not avail them in the least against (the will of) Allah; it was but a need of Ya`qub's inner self which he discharged. And verily, he was endowed with knowledge because We had taught him, but most men know not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "And when they had entered as their father had bidden them, it did not avail them aught against Allah, but (it was only) a desire in the soul of Yaqoub which he satisfied; and surely he was possessed of knowledge because We had given him knowledge, but most people do not know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "And when they entered after the manner their father commanded them, it availed them nothing against God; but it was a need in Jacob's soul that he so satisfied. Verily he was possessed of a knowledge for that We had taught him; but most men know not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "And when they entered in the manner which their father had enjoined, it would have naught availed them as against Allah; it was but a need of Jacob's soul which he thus satisfied; and lo! he was a lord of knowledge because We had taught him; but most of mankind know not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "They entered [safely] as their father had told them. However, he had no power to guard them against God's decree. It was only a wish in Jacob's soul which he had thus fulfilled. He was possessed of knowledge which We had given him. But most people have no knowledge.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "And when they entered as their father had enjoined them, it availed them not against Allah at all; it was only a craving in the soul of Ya qub that he satisfied; verily he was endued with knowledge, for We had taught him; but most of the people know not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "When they entered whence their father had bidden them, it did not avail them anything against Allah, but only fulfilled a wish in Jacob\u2019s heart. Indeed, he had the knowledge of what We had taught him, but most people do not know.\n",

For he was, by our instruction, full of knowledge (and experience): but most men know not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "And when they entered according to their father's advice, it did not avail them in the least against (the Will of) Allah, it was but a need of Ya'qub's (Jacob) inner-self which he discharged. And verily, he was endowed with knowledge because We had taught him, but most men know not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "And when they entered from where their father had instructed them, nothing helped them against (the decree of) Allah. It was but a need in Jacob's soul which he had fulfilled. He possessed knowledge because of what We had taught him, though most people do not know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "And when they entered as their father had instructed them, it did not avail them anything against God; it was just a need in the soul of Jacob, which he carried out. He was a person of knowledge inasmuch as We had taught him, but most people do not know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "And when they entered from where their father had ordered them, it did not avail them against Allah at all except [it was] a need within the soul of Jacob, which he satisfied. And indeed, he was a possessor of knowledge because of what We had taught him, but most of the people do not know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[12:68] God, exalted be He, says: And when they entered in the manner which their father had bidden them, that is, separately, it did not avail them anything (min shay\u2019in: min is extra) against God, that is, [against] His decree; it was but a need in Jacob\u2019s soul which he [thus] satisfied, and this [need] was his desire to fend off the evil eye [from them], out of affection [for them]. And verily he was possessed of knowledge, because We had taught him; but most of mankind \u2014 and they are the disbelievers \u2014 do not know, [about] God\u2019s inspiring His elect.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And when they entered) Egypt (in the manner which their father had enjoined) as their father commanded them, (it would have naught availed them as against Allah) against what Allah had decreed for them; (it was but a need of Jacob's soul) in Jacob's heart (which he thus satisfied) which he expressed; (and lo! He) i.e. Jacob (was a lord of knowledge) of remembrance (because We had taught him) of that which We taught him of legal rulings, punishments, decree and destiny; he knew that nothing happens except what Allah decrees; (but most of mankind) the people of Egypt (know not) this nor believe in it.\n"
