Yet comely patience!, without any anxiety! (fasabrun jam\u012blun is the predicate of a missing subject such as amr\u012b, \u2018my course]\u2019).

(And Allah it is whose help is to be sought) I seek the help of Allah (in that (predicament) which ye describe) to be patient for his death, as you say.
