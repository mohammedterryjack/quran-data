        "TRANSLATION_1": "(As they were leaving) their father said to them: \"O my sons, do not seek one approach but employ different ways (of attaining your object). If anything should befall you from God I shall not be able to avert it, for all authority belongs to God. I have placed my trust in Him, and the trusting should rely on Him alone.\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "And he enjoined them: \"My sons! Do not enter the city by one gate; rather enter it by different gates. I can be of no help to you against Allah. Allah's command alone prevails. In Him have I put my trust and in Him should all those who have faith put their trust.\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Jacob then told his sons, \"Do not enter the town all together by a single gate, but each of you enter separately. I cannot help you against (the decree of) God.

Yet I cannot avail, protect, you, by this that I have said, against God (min All\u0101hi: min is extra) anything, which He might have decreed against you; this [that I have said] is only out of affection [for you]. Judgement belongs to God, alone. On Him I rely, in Him I trust, and on Him let all the trusting rely\u2019.\n",

(I can naught avail you as against Allah) against Allah's decree concerning you. (Lo! the decision) the judgement regarding what is decreed for you (rests with Allah only. In Him do I put my trust) I delegate my matter and yours to Him, (and in Him let all the trusting put their trust) those who rely should rely on Him; it is also said that this means: the believers should put their trust in Allah. Here, Jacob feared the evil eye against his sons, because they were all seemly and handsome.\n"
