This is from that which my Lord has taught me \u2014 herein is an incitement for them to believe, which he reinforces with the following words: Lo! I have forsaken the creed, the religion, of a folk who do not believe in God and who moreover (hum, \u2018they\u2019 [is repeated] for emphasis) are disbelievers in the Hereafter.\n",

(This) the interpretation of dreams (is of that which my Lord hath taught me. Lo! I have forsaken the religion of folk) I did not follow the religion of a people (who believe not in Allah and are disbelievers in) they are deniers of (the Hereafter) resurrection after death.\n"
