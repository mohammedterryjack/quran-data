So it was, that We made him see the proof, that We might ward off from him evil, betrayal, and lewdness, [the act of] fornication. Truly he was of Our devoted servants, in terms of obedience (mukhlis\u012bn: a variant reading has mukhlas\u012bn, in other words, \u2018chosen/purified [servants]\u2019).\n",

(Thus it was, that We might ward off from him evil and lewdness) adultery. (Lo! he was of Our chosen slaves) who are protected from adultery.\n"
