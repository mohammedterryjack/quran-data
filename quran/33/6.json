        "TRANSLATION_1": "The Prophet is closer to the faithful than they are themselves; and his wives are as their mothers.

That was in the Book inscribed.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[33:6] The Prophet is closer to the believers than their [own] souls, in terms of what he calls them to and what their own souls have called them to contravene, and his wives are their mothers, insofar as they [the believers] are forbidden to marry them. And those related by blood, kinsmen, are more entitled, to inherit [from], one another in the Book of God than the [other] believers and the Emigrants, in other words, than inheriting on account of [their sharing] faith and the Emigration, which had been the case at the beginning of Islam but was then abrogated; barring any favour you may do your friends, by [making] a bequest, which is permissible. This, namely, the abrogation of inheritance on account of [shared] faith and Emigration by the inheritance on account of kinship, is written in the Book \u2014 in both instances al-kit\u0101b, \u2018the Book\u2019, denotes the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahf\u016bz).\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "He said: (The Prophet is closer to the believers) the Prophet has a better right to preserve the children of the believers (than their selves) after they die, due to the saying of the Prophet (pbuh): \"Whoever dies and leaves behind a burden I will carry it for him, or a debt I will pay it back for him, or wealth it will go to his inheritors\", (and his wives) the wives of the Prophet (pbuh) (are (as) their mothers) are like their mother in unmarriageability. (And the owners of kinship) those related with ties of kinship (are closer one to another) have more right to one another in relation to inheritance (in the ordinance of Allah) thus it is written in the Guarded Tablet; and it is said: thus it is written in the Torah; and it is said: thus it is written in the Qur'an (than (other) believers and the fugitives (who fled from Mecca) except that ye should do kindness) a bequest not exceeding a third of the whole inheritance (to your friends) your custodians in religion or your friends. (This) inheritance for relatives and bequests for friends or clients (is written in the Book) in the Guarded Tablet; it is also said: it is written in the Torah and the Children of Israel practise it.\n"
