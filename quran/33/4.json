        "TRANSLATION_17": "[33:4] God has not placed two hearts inside any man: [this was revealed] in order to refute those disbelievers who said that they each had two hearts with which they could reason better than Muhammad\u2019s single mind; nor has He made your wives whom (read as all\u0101\u2019\u012b, or all\u0101\u2019) you repudiate by zih\u0101r (read tazzahhar\u016bna, or tuz\u0101hir\u016bna; the original t\u0101\u2019 [of tataz\u0101har\u016bna] has been assimilated with the z\u0101\u2019) \u2014 a man would say to his wife for example, \u2018You are for me as [untouchable as] my mother\u2019s back\u2019 \u2014 your mothers, in other words, [He has not made you wives] like [your] mothers, so that they are illicit [for conjugality] in that respect, [a practice] which in pre-Islamic times was considered a [valid form of] divorce. An atonement with [necessary] conditions is necessary in such a case, as mentioned in s\u016brat al-Muj\u0101dila [Q. 58:2-3]. Nor has He made those whom you claim as [adopted] sons (ad\u2018iy\u0101\u2019, the plural of da\u2018iyy, which is one claimed as the son of one who is not his [biological] father) your sons, in reality. That is a mere utterance of your mouths, namely, [of] the Jews and the hypocrites. When the Prophet (s) married Zaynab bt. Jahsh, who had been Zayd b. H\u0101ritha\u2019s wife, the adopted son of the Prophet (s), they said, \u2018Muhammad married his son\u2019s wife!\u2019, and so God proved them liars in this. But God speaks the truth, in this [matter], and He guides to the way, the way of truth.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Allah hath not assigned unto any man two hearts within his body) this was revealed about Abu Ma'mar Jamil Ibn Asad who was called \"the one with two hearts\" because of his measured speech, (nor hath He made your wives whom ye declare (to be your mothers)) by a simple oath ((to be your mothers) your mothers) as your mother in relation to unmarriageability-this was revealed about Aws Ibn al-Samit the 472 brother of 'Ubadah Ibn al-Samit and his wife Khawlah-, (nor hath he made those whom ye claim (to be your sons)) those whom you adopted in order to help and strengthen you (your sons) like your real sons. (This is but a saying of your mouths) between yourselves. (But Allah saith the Truth) Allah explains the Truth (and He showeth the way) and lead to what is right.\n"
