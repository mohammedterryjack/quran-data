As Moses chased it and took his robe to cover himself, they saw that he had no such inflammation (udra is an inflammation of the testicle). And he was distinguished in God\u2019s sight. An instance of our Prophet (s) being subjected to hurt was when [on one occasion] while dividing up the spoils a man said to him, \u2018This is a division that I do not want to please God!\u2019, whereat the Prophet (s) became angered and said, \u2018May God have mercy upon Moses, for truly he was hurt with worse than this, but endured\u2019 \u2014 reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b.\n",
