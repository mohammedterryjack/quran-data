But when fear departs they flay you with sharp tongues, grasping for wealth. Such people have no iman and Allah will make their actions come to nothing. That is easy for Allah.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Being chary of helping you. But when danger appears you will find them looking at you with eyes turning like a man's in the swoon of death. Yet when the danger is past they lash you with sharp tongues, covetous of the best (of booty). Such as these have not come to belief. So God nullifies whatever they have done. This is how (the innate law of) God works inevitably.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "They are utterly niggardly (in coming to your aid). Whenever there is danger, you will see them looking at you, their eyes rolling as though they were on the verge of fainting at the approach of death. But when the danger passes away, their greed for wealth prompts them to greet you with their sharp, scissor-like tongues. These are the ones who never truly believed, and so Allah has caused their deeds to be reduced to naught. That is easy enough for Allah.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "They are niggardly in spending for you. When fear comes, you can see them looking at you, their eyes rolling about like to faint because of the agony of death. When their fear subsides, they start to bite you with their sharp tongues. They are miserly in spending for a virtuous cause and have no faith. God has turned their deeds devoid of all virtue. This was not at all difficult for God.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "They reduce the help towards you; so when a fearful time comes, you will observe them looking at you with eyes rolling like one enveloped by death; then when the time of fear is over, they begin slandering you with sharp tongues in their greed for the war booty; they have not accepted faith, therefore Allah has nullified their deeds; and this is easy for Allah.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Being miserly towards you. Then when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes revolving like one over whom hovers death; but when the fear departs, they will smite you with sharp tongues, miserly towards good. Such have not believed. Therefore, Allah makes their deeds fruitless and that is ever easy for Allah.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "Being niggardly with respect to you; but when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes rolling like one swooning because of death; but when the fear is gone they smite you with sharp tongues, being niggardly of the good things. These have not believed, therefore Allah has made their doing naught; and this is easy to Allah.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "being niggardly towards you. When fear comes upon them, thou seest them looking at thee, their eyes rolling like one who swoons of death; but when the fear departs, they flay you with sharp tongues, being niggardly to possess the good things. Those have never believed; God has made their works to fail; and that is easy for God.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Being sparing of their help to you (believers). But when the fear cometh, then thou (Muhammad) seest them regarding thee with rolling eyes like one who fainteth unto death.

And that is easy for Allah.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_10": "Being niggardly toward you. Then when the fightin cometh, thou beholdest them look unto thee, their eyes rolling about, like the eyes of him who fainteth unto death. Then when the fighting is over they inveigh against you with sharp tongues, being niggardly of the good things. These have not believed; wherefore Allah hath made their works of none effect, and that is with Allah ever easy.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "grudging you [their help]. So when there is panic, you see them looking at you, with their eyes rolling like someone fainting at death. Then, when the panic is over, they scald you with [their] sharp tongues in their greed for the spoils. They never have had faith. So Allah has made their works fail, and that is easy for Allah.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "Covetous over you. Then when fear comes, thou wilt see them looking to thee, their eyes revolving, like (those of) one over whom hovers death: but when the fear is past, they will smite you with sharp tongues, covetous of goods. Such men have no faith, and so Allah has made their deeds of none effect: and that is easy for Allah.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "Being miserly towards you (as regards help and aid in Allah's Cause). Then when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes revolving like (those of) one over whom hovers death, but when the fear departs, they will smite you with sharp tongues, miserly towards (spending anything in any) good (and only covetous of booty and wealth). Such have not believed. Therefore Allah makes their deeds fruitless, and that is ever easy for Allah.\n",

But when fear departs, they lash you with sharp tongues, indisposed toward [any] good. Those have not believed, so Allah has rendered their deeds worthless, and ever is that, for Allah, easy.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[33:19] grudging to you, in their help (ashihha, \u2018grudging\u2019, is the plural of shah\u012bh, and is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject [of the verb] ya\u2019t\u016bna, \u2018they engage\u2019). And when there is a panic, you see them looking at you, their eyes rolling like one, that is, like the look of one, or the rolling of one, fainting at death, in other words, [one] in the throes thereof; but when the panic subsides, and the spoils have been secured, they scald you, they hurt you, or they smite you, with [their] sharp tongues, in their greed for the riches, in other words, for the spoils, which they demand [greedily]. Those, they never believed, really. Therefore God has invalidated their works, and that, invalidation, is easy for God, by His will.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Being sparing of their help to you (believers)) they claimed they took pity on the believers; it is also said that this means: they are too niggardly when it is a question of spending on the believers. (But when the fear) of the enemy (cometh, then thou (Muhammad) seetthem) the hypocrites in the Ditch (regarding thee with rolling eyes like one who fainteth unto death) like the one suffering from the pangs of death. (Then, when the fear) of the enemy (departeth, they scald you with sharp tongues) they attack and vilify you (in their greed for wealth (from the spoil)) they are stingy when it comes to spending in the way of Allah. (Such) those who have such traits (have not believed) are not sincere in their faith. (Therefore Allah maketh their deeds fruitless) Allah thwarts their good deeds by means of their evil works. (And that) thwarting good deeds (is easy for Allah).\n"
