This [verse] was revealed regarding \u2018Abd All\u0101h b. Jahsh and his sister Zaynab, whose hand the Prophet had asked for in marriage, but meaning on behalf of Zayd b. H\u0101ritha. They were loathe to this [proposal] when they found out [that it was on the latter\u2019s behalf], for they had thought that the Prophet (s) wanted to marry her himself. But afterwards they consented because of the [following part of the] verse: And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger has certainly strayed into manifest error. Thus the Prophet (s) gave her in marriage to Zayd. Then on one occasion he [the Prophet] caught sight of her and felt love for her, whereafter [when he realised that] Zayd lost his affection for her and so said to the Prophet (s), \u2018I want to part with her\u2019. But the Prophet said to him, \u2018Retain your wife for yourself\u2019, as God, exalted be He, says:\n",
