        "TRANSLATION_1": "You may have thought that they were awake, yet they were asleep. We made them turn right and left, while their dog lay with his forelegs stretched across the threshold. If you had looked at them you would have surely turned away and fled with horror at the sight.\n",

Had you looked upon them you would have certainly fled away from them, their sight filling you with terror.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "One would think them (the youths) awake while, in fact, they were sleeping. We turned their bodies from right to left and their dog stretched its front legs on the ground. Had one looked them over, he would have run away from them in terror.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And you may think they are awake, whereas they are asleep; and We turn them over to the right and the left \u2013 and their dog is on the threshold of the cave, with its paws outstretched; O listener, were you to look at them closely, you would turn back running away from them, and be filled with their dread.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "And you would have thought them awake, whereas they were asleep.

And We turned them on their right and on their left sides, and their dog stretching forth his two forelegs at the entrance [of the Cave or in the space near to the entrance of the Cave (as a guard at the gate)]. Had you looked at them, you would certainly have turned back from them in flight, and would certainly have been filled with awe of them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "You might have thought them awake, though they were sleeping. We turned them about to the right and to the left, while their dog stretched its paws at the entrance.

And We caused them to turn over to the right and to the left, lest the earth consume their flesh, and their dog [lay] stretching its forelegs, his paws, on the threshold, at the opening of the cave: whenever they turned over it would turn over just like them, both during sleep and consciousness. If you had observed them you would have turned away from them in flight and you would have been filled (read la-mulli\u2019ta or lamuli\u2019ta) with awe because of them (read ru\u2018ban or ru\u2018uban, \u2018awe\u2019): [it was] through this awe that God protected them from anyone entering upon them.\n",

(If thou hadst observed them closely) in that state (thou hadst assuredly turned away from them in flight, and hadst been filled with awe of them) and you would have been sacred of them.\n"
