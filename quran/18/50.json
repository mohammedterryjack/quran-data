        "TRANSLATION_2": "And recall when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam\"; all of them fell prostrate, except Iblis. He was of the jinn and so disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will you, then, take him and his progeny as your guardians rather than Me although they are your open enemies?

Will you then take him and his offspring \u2014 this address is to Adam and his progeny (the [final pronominal suffix] h\u0101\u2019 in both words refers to Ibl\u012bs) for your patrons instead of Me, obeying them, when they are an enemy to you?, in other words, [when they are your] enemies (wa-hum lakum \u2018aduwwun is a circumstantial qualifier). How evil for the evildoers is that substitute!, of Ibl\u012bs and his offspring, in obeying them instead of obeying God.\n",

(He was of the jinn) of the tribe of the jinn, (so he rebelled against his Lord's command) he disobeyed his Lord and refused to prostrate to Adam. (Will ye choose him) will you worship him (and his seed for your protecting friends) as lords (instead of Me) instead of Allah, (when they are an enemy unto you) whose enmity is quite manifest? (Calamitous is the exchange) in worship; it is also said that this means: evil is that which they exchanged: they exchanged the worship of Allah with the worship of Satan; and it is also said: they exchanged the protecting friendship of Allah with the protecting friendship of Satan (for evil-doers) for idolaters!\n"
