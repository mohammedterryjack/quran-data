The import is: [the life of] this world is likened to flourishing vegetation which then becomes dry, is broken up and scattered by the winds (a variant reading [for riy\u0101h, \u2018winds\u2019] has r\u012bh).

Likewise, the life of this world will vanish and nothing of its adornment will remain. (Allah is Able to do all things) He is Able to make the life of this world vanish and the Hereafter subsist.\n"
