Indeed We have prepared for the wrongdoers, that is, the disbelievers, a Fire, and they will be surrounded by its pavilion, [by] that which encloses [the Fire itself]. If they cry out for help, they will be succoured with water like molten copper, like thick [burning] oil, which scalds faces, because of [the intensity of] its heat, if it is brought near them. What an evil drink, that is, and how ill, is the Fire [as], a resting-place! (murtafaqan is a specification derived from the agent of the verb, in other words, vile is the person choosing to rest thereon; and this is in contrast to what He will say next about Paradise: How fair a resting-place [below, verse 31]. For, indeed, what resting-place can there be in the Fire?\n",

Then whosoever will, let him believe, and whosoever will, let him disbelieve) this is a threat from Allah; it is also said that this means: for whomever Allah wants faith, he will believe; and for whomever He does not want faith, he will not believe. (Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers) for 'Uyaynah and his host (Fire. Its tent encloseth them) the extent of the Fire surrounds them. (If they ask for showers) if they ask for water to drink, (they will be showered with water like molten lead) like boiling oil or hot liquid silver (which burneth the faces. Calamitous the drink and ill the resting place!) evil is their dwelling; He says: evil is the abode of their companions: the satans and the disbelievers.\n"
