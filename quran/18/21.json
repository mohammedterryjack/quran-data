        "TRANSLATION_0": "Accordingly We made them chance upon them unexpectedly so they might know that Allah's promise is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour. When they were arguing among themselves about the matter, they said, 'Wall up their cave, their Lord knows best about them.' But those who got the better of the argument concerning them said, 'We will build a place of worship over them.'",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Thus did We inform the people about them that they may know the promise of God is true, and there is no doubt that the Hour will come. As they were arguing among themselves as to what should be done with them, (some) said: \"Erect a monument over them. Their Lord is best cognisant of them.\" Those who prevailed, said: \"We shall build a place of worship over their (sepulchre).\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Thus did We make their case known to the people of the city so that they might know that Allah's promise is true, and that there is absolutely no doubt that the Hour will come to pass. But instead of giving thought to this, they disputed with one another concerning the People of the Cave, some saying: \"Build a wall over them. Their Lord alone knows best about them.\" But those who prevailed over their affairs said: \"We shall build a place of worship over them.\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "We caused their story to become public so that people would know that God's promise was true and that there is no doubt about the coming of the Day of Judgment. They started to argue with each other about the matter (Resurrection) and some of them said, \"Let us establish a building at the youths' sleeping place (to hide them). Their Lord knew best their intentions about them. The majority prevailed in their suggestion of the establishment of a mosque in that place.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And this is how We made them known for people to know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt concerning the Last Day; when the people began disputing among themselves regarding them, they said, \u201cConstruct a building over their cave\u201d; their Lord well knows them; those who dominated in this matter said, \u201cWe promise we will build a mosque over them.\u201d\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "And thus We made their case known, that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour. (Remember) when they (the people) disputed among themselves about their case, they said: \"Construct a building over them; their Lord knows best about them,\" (then) those who won their point said: \"We verily, shall build a place of worship over them.\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "And thus did We make (men) to get knowledge of them that they might know that Allah's promise is true and that as for the hour there is no doubt about it. When they disputed among themselves about their affair and said: Erect an edifice over them-- their Lord best knows them. Those who prevailed in their affair said: We will certainly raise a masjid over them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "And even so We made them stumble upon them, that they might know that God's promise is true, and that the Hour -- there is no doubt of it. When they were contending among themselves of their affair then they said, 'Build over them a building; their Lord knows of them very well.' Said those who prevailed over their affair, 'We will raise over them a place of worship.'\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "And in like manner We disclosed them (to the people of the city) that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that, as for the Hour, there is no doubt concerning it. When (the people of the city) disputed of their case among themselves, they said: Build over them a building; their Lord knoweth best concerning them. Those who won their point said: We verily shall build a place of worship over them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "Thus We disclosed things to them so that they might know that God's promise was true and there was no doubt about the Hour [Judgement Day]. The people argued about them among themselves. They said, \"Build a monument over them. Their Lord knows best concerning them.\" Those who prevailed in their affair said, \"Let us surely build a place of worship over them.\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "And likewise We caused their affair to be lit upon that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that the Hour- there is no doubt thereof, Recall what time they were disputing among themselves regarding their affair, and then they said: build over them a building--their Lord is the Best Knower about them-then those who prevailed in their affair said: surely we will raise over them a place of worship.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "So it was that We let them come upon them, that they might know that Allah\u2019s promise is true, and that there is no doubt in the Hour. As they disputed among themselves about their matter, they said, \u2018Build a building over them. Their Lord knows them best.\u2019 Those who had the say in their matter said, \u2018We will set up a place of worship over them.\u2019\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "Thus did We make their case known to the people, that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour of Judgment. Behold, they dispute among themselves as to their affair.

        "TRANSLATION_13": "And thus We made their case known to the people, that they might know that the Promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour. (Remember) when they (the people of the city) disputed among themselves about their case, they said: \"Construct a building over them, their Lord knows best about them,\" (then) those who won their point said (most probably the disbelievers): \"We verily shall build a place of worship over them.\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "And so We made them (the unbelievers) stumble upon them, so that they might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt about theHour. They argued among themselves over their affair, then (the unbelievers) said: 'Build a building over them (their remains). Their Lord knows best who they were. 'But those who prevailed over the matter said; 'We will build around them a Mosque'\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "So it was, that We caused them to be discovered, that they would know that the promise of God is true, and that of the Hour there is no doubt. As they were disputing their case among themselves, they said, \u201cBuild over them a building.\u201d Their Lord knows best about them. Those who prevailed over their case said, \u201cWe will set up over them a place of worship.\u201d\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "And similarly, We caused them to be found that they [who found them] would know that the promise of Allah is truth and that of the Hour there is no doubt. [That was] when they disputed among themselves about their affair and [then] said, \"Construct over them a structure. Their Lord is most knowing about them.\" Said those who prevailed in the matter, \"We will surely take [for ourselves] over them a masjid.\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[18:21] And so, just as We aroused them, it was that We disclosed them, [to] their people and the believers, that they, that is, their people, might know that God\u2019s promise, of resurrection, is true: by virtue of the fact that One Who has the power to make them sleep for [such] a long period of time, or sustain them in that state without nourishment, also has the power to resurrect the dead; and that, as for the Hour, there is no doubt, no uncertainty, concerning it. Behold (idh adverbially qualifies a\u2018tharn\u0101, \u2018We disclosed\u2019) they were disputing, that is, the believers and the disbelievers, among themselves their affair, the affair of the youths, with regard to building something around them [as a monument]; so they, the disbelievers, said, \u2018Build over them, that is, around them, a building, to cover them up; their Lord knows them best.\u2019 Those who prevailed   regarding their affair, the affair of the youths, namely, the believers, \u2018We will verily set up over them, around them, a place of worship\u2019, for prayers to be performed therein. And this indeed took place at the entrance of the cave.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And in like manner We disclosed them (to the people of the city)) the city of Ephesus, the believers among 314 them and the disbelievers, and their king of the time was a believer called Yustafad, the king Decius had died long before that (that they might know) both the believers and disbelievers (that the promise of Allah) resurrection after death (is true) takes place, (and that, as for the Hour, there is no doubt concerning it. When (the people of the city) disputed of their case among themselves) when their words differed among themselves, (they said) i.e. the disbelievers said: (Build over them a building) a church because they are followers of our religion; (their Lord knoweth best concerning them. Those who won their point said) those whose argument did not prevail, i.e. the believers: (We verily shall build a place of worship over them) because they are followers of our religion; their difference being about this point.\n"
