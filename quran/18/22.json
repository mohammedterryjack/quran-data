And they, that is, the believers, will say, \u2018Seven; and their dog the eighth of them\u2019 (the sentence is [part of] the subject clause, the predicate of which is the adjectival qualification of sab\u2018a, \u2018seven\u2019 [namely, th\u0101minuhum, \u2018the eighth of them\u2019] with the additional w\u0101w [wath\u0101minuhum], which is said to be for emphasis, or an indication that the adjective is [semantically] attached to that which it is qualifying). The qualification of the first two sayings as being \u2018random\u2019, but not the third, is proof that [the latter] is the satisfactory and correct [number]. Say: \u2018My Lord knows best their number, and none knows them except a few\u2019: Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s said, \u2018I am [one] of these \u201cfew\u201d [described]\u2019, and he mentioned that they were seven. So do not contend concerning them except with an outward manner [of contention], [except] with that which has been revealed to you, and do not question concerning them, do not ask for opinions [from], any of them, [from] the People of the Scripture, the Jews. The people of Mecca asked him [the Prophet] about the story of the People of the Cave, and so he said to them, \u2018I will tell you about it tomorrow\u2019, but without adding [the words], \u2018If God wills\u2019 (insh\u0101\u2019a\u2019 Ll\u0101hu) and so the following was revealed:\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "((Some) will say) the Christians of Najran, al-Sayyid and his followers who were Nestorians, will say: (They were three) they were three young men in the Cave, (their dog) Qatmir (the fourth, and (some) say) al- 'Aqib and his followers who were Jacobite Christians will say: (Five) they were five young men, (their dog the sixth, guessing at random) without having definite knowledge; (and (some) say) the followers of al-Malik who were Melkites: (Seven) they were seven young men, (and their dog the eighth. Say) to them, Muhammad: (My Lord is best aware of their number. None knoweth them save a few) among the believers. Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him and with his father, said: \"I am among those few: they were eight young men, and the dog\". (So contend not concerning them) so do not argue with them concerning the number of the sleepers of the Cave (except with an outward contending) unless you recite the Qur'an to them outwardly, (and ask not any of them to pronounce concerning them) do not ask any one of them about their number; enough is what Allah has clarified to you.\n"
