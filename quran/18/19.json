(They said: We have tarried a day) and when they left the cave and saw that the sun did set yet, they said: (or some part of a day.

(Now send one of you) Yamblichus (Yamlikha) (with this your silver coin unto the city) of Ephesus (Afsus), (and let him see what food is purest there) the largest quantity; it is also said that this means: the best of bread and most lawful slaughtered meat (and bring you a supply thereof.
