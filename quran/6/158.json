Say: 'Wait, then; We too are waiting.'",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "What are the people waiting for? For the angels to come down, or your Lord to appear, or some signs from your Lord? The day when certain signs appear from your Lord, the embracing of faith shall not be of any avail to one who did not come to belief at first, or who did not perform good deeds by virtue of his faith. Tell them: \"Wait on, we are waiting too (for the good and evil to become distinct).\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "What! Do they wait either for the angels to appear before them or for your Lord to come unto them or for some clear signs of your Lord to appear before them? When some clear signs of your Lord will appear, believing will be of no avail to anyone who did not believe before, or who earned no good deeds through his faith. Say: 'Wait on; we too are waiting.'\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Are they waiting until the angels or your Lord come to them or for some miracles to take place? On the day when some miracles of God will take place, the belief of any soul will be of no avail to it unless some good deeds have been done with it, or it has been formed before the coming of such a day. (Muhammad), tell them, \"Wait and we, too, are waiting.\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "What are they waiting for \u2013 except that the angels come to them, or the punishment from your Lord, or one of the signs of your Lord? On the day when the (foretold) sign of your Lord comes, not a single soul who had not earlier accepted faith nor earned any good from its faith, will benefit from accepting faith; say, \u201cWait \u2013 we too are waiting.\u201d\n",

On the day that one of your Lord\u2019s signs comes \u2014 and this is the rising of the sun from the west, as reported in the had\u012bth of the two Sah\u012bhs [of Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim] \u2014 it shall not benefit a soul to believe if it had not believed theretofore (lam takun \u0101manat min qabl is an adjectival qualification of nafs, \u2018a soul\u2019) or, a soul which had not [until then], earned in its belief some good, some [act of] obedience, that is to say, its repentance shall be of no benefit to it, as [stated] in the had\u012bth [corpus]. Say: \u2018Wait, for one of these things, We too are waiting\u2019, for it.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Wait they) i.e. the people of Mecca, (indeed, for nothing less than that the angels should come unto them) to take their souls away at the moment of death, (or thy Lord should come) on the Day of Judgement, and His coming is without modality, (or there should come one of the portents from thy Lord) i.e. the rising of the sun from the West? (In the day when one of the portents from they Lord cometh) before the rising of the sun from the West, (its belief availeth naught a soul which theretofore) before the rising of the sun from the West (believed not, nor in its belief earned good) nor was it sincere in its belief, nor doing any good works before the rising of the sun from the West. This is because no faith, works or repentance are accepted from an unbeliever who embraces Islam upon seeing the sun rise from the West, unless that person is young at that time or is born after. In such a case, if he leaves Islam after the sun rises from the West and then returns to Islam, his repentance is accepted. Likewise, the repentance of a sinning believer who repents of his sins after the sun rises from the West is accepted. (Say) Muhammad to the people of Mecca: (Wait you) the Day of Judgement! (Lo! We (too) are waiting) for your punishment on the Day of Judgement or before the Day of Judgement; it is also said that this means: Say, Muhammad, wait for my destruction, I am also waiting for yours.\n"
