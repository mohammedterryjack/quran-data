Eat of the fruit thereof when it ripens, before its maturity [passes], and pay the due thereof, the alms as appropriate, on the day of its harvest (read yawma has\u0101dahu or yawma has\u0101dihi), that is, one tenth or half of it, and do not be prodigal, by giving it all away, so that nothing remains for [the consumption of] your dependants. Truly, God does not love the prodigal, who overstep [the bounds of] that which He has delimited for them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(He it is Who produceth) creates (gardens trellised) spread out: i.e. not resting on trunks such as vines and other vegetations (and untrellised) that which rests on trunks such as walnuts and almonds, (and the date- palm, and crops of diverse flavour) sweetness and sourness, (and the olive) and He created the olive tree (and the pomegranate) of pomegranate trees, (like) in colour and appearance (and unlike) in taste. (Eat you of the fruit thereof) of the fruit of the palm-tree (when it fruits) when it ripens, (and pay the due thereof upon the harvest day) it could also mean upon measuring it, (and be not prodigal) do not spend in disobedience of Allah nor prevent the obedience of Allah; it is also said that this means: do not forbid the Bahirah, the Sa'ibah, the Wasilah and the Ham. (Lo! Allah loveth not the prodigals) those who spend in disobedience of Allah; or it could mean: the idolaters. It is said that this verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays who collected with his own hands the harvest of 500 palm-trees and gave it away, not leaving a thing for his own family.\n"
