        "TRANSLATION_1": "Thus God guides whomsoever He please by opening wide his breast to surrender; and Straitens the breasts of those He allows to go astray, (who feel suffocated) as if they were ascending the skies. Thus will God punish those who do not believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Thus, (it is a fact that) whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his breast for Islam; and whomsoever He wills to let go astray, He causes his breast to become strait and constricted, as if he were climbing towards the heaven. Thus Allah lays the abomination (of flight from and hatred of Islam) on those who do not believe\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "God will open the hearts of whomever He wants to guide to Islam, but He will tighten the chest of one whom He has led astray, as though he was climbing high up into the sky. Thus, God places wickedness on those who do not accept the faith.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And whomever Allah wills to guide, He opens his bosom for Islam; and whomever He wills to send astray, He makes his bosom narrow and firmly bound as if he were being forced by someone to climb the skies; this is how Allah places the punishment on those who do not believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islam; and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky. Thus Allah puts the wrath on those who believe not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "Therefore (for) whomsoever Allah intends that He would guide him aright, He expands his breast for Islam, and (for) whomsoever He intends that He should cause him to err, He makes his breast strait and narrow as though he were ascending upwards; thus does Allah lay uncleanness on those who do not believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "Whomsoever God desires to guide, He expands his breast to Islam; whomsoever He desires to lead astray, He makes his breast narrow, tight, as if he were climbing to heaven. So God lays abomination upon those who believe not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "And whomsoever it is Allah's will to guide, He expandeth his bosom unto the Surrender, and whomsoever it is His Will to send astray, He maketh his bosom close and narrow as if he were engaged in sheer ascent. Thus Allah layeth ignominy upon those who believe not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "When God desires to guide someone, He opens his breast to Islam; and whoever He wills to let go astray, He causes his breast to be constricted as if he had to climb up to the skies. That is how God heaps ignominy upon those who refuse to believe.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_11": "Whomever Allah desires to guide, He opens his breast to Islam, and whomever He desires to lead astray, He makes his breast narrow and straitened as if he were climbing to a height. Thus does Allah lay [spiritual] defilement on those who do not have faith.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_14": "Whomsoever Allah desires to guide, He expands his chest to Islam (submission). Whomsoever He desires to lead astray, He makes his chest narrow, tight, as though he were climbing to heaven. As such Allah lays the scourge on the unbelievers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "Whomever God desires to guide, He spreads open his heart to Islam; and whomever He desires to misguide, He makes his heart narrow, constricted, as though he were climbing up the sky. God thus lays defilement upon those who do not believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "So whoever Allah wants to guide - He expands his breast to [contain] Islam; and whoever He wants to misguide - He makes his breast tight and constricted as though he were climbing into the sky. Thus does Allah place defilement upon those who do not believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[6:125] Whomever God desires to guide, He expands his breast to Islam, by casting into his heart a light which it [the heart] expands for and accepts, as reported in a had\u012bth; and whomever He, God, desires to send astray, He makes his breast narrow (read dayqan or dayyiqan), [unable] to accept it, and constricted, extremely tight (read harijan, \u2018constricted\u2019, as an adjective, or harajan as a verbal noun, by which it [the heart of the misguided one] is described hyperbolically) as if he were engaged in ascent (yassa\u2018\u2018ad, is also read as yass\u0101\u2018ad: in both [forms] the original t\u0101\u2019 has been assimilated with the s\u0101d; a third [variant reading] has yas\u2018ad) to the heaven, when he is charged with [the obligations of] the faith, because of the hardship for him therein. So, like this making [of the breast narrow], God casts ignominy, chastisement, or [He casts] Satan, that is, He gives him authority, over those who do not believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "149 (And whomsoever it is Allah's will to guide) to His religion, (He expandeth his bosom) His heart (unto the Surrender) unto accepting Islam, (and whomsoever it is His will to send astray) to leave in error and disbelief, (He maketh his bosom) He leaves his heart (close) like the ferrule of a spear (and narrow) in doubt; this could also mean: the light cannot find a way, or a passage to his heart (as if he were engaged in sheer ascent) like a person who is told to rise in heaven: the heart of such a person is not guided to Islam. (Thus Allah layeth ignominy) Allah leaves denial (upon those) in the heart of those (who believe not) in Muhammad (pbuh), or in the Qur'an, and then He punishes them for their disbelief.\n"
