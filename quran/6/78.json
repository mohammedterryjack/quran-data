This is bigger than the first and the second. (And when it set) when it disappeared, Abraham said: I do not love a lord who is not lasting. If Allah does not guide me, I shall be of those who err. It is also said that Abraham said 'this is my Lord' mocking his people, for his people worshipped the sun, the moon and the stars. He therefore objected to such worship by mocking them, saying to them: could the like of these be a Lord? When he emerged from the hole and went to his people- he was then 17 years old-he looked at the sky and the earth and then said: my Lord is Him Who has created this. He then proceeded until he found a group of his people attending with devotion to their idols, (he exclaimed: my people! Lo! I am free from all that ye associate (with Him)) of idols. 142\n"
