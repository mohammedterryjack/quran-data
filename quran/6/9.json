        "TRANSLATION_0": "And if We had made him an angel We would still have made him a man, and further confused for them the very thing they are confused about!",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Even if We had sent down an angel as messenger he would have appeared in the garb of a man and filled them with confusion, like the one they are filled with.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Had We appointed an angel, We would have sent him down in the form of a man - and thus We would have caused them the same doubt which they now entertain.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Were We to have made him (Our Messenger) an angel, We would have made him resemble a human being and they would have again complained that the matter was as confusing to them as it is to them now.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And had we appointed an angel as a Prophet, We would still have made him as a man and would keep them in the same doubt, as they are now in.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "And had We appointed him an angel, We indeed would have made him a man, and We would have certainly caused them confusion in a matter which they have already covered with confusion.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "And if We had made him angel, We would certainly have made him a man, and We would certainly have made confused to them what they make confused.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "And had We made him an angel, yet assuredly We would have made him a man, and confused for them the thing which they themselves are confusing.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Had we appointed him (Our messenger) an angel, We assuredly had made him (as) a man (that he might speak to men); and (thus) obscured for them (the truth) they (now) obscure.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "Indeed, if We had sent an angel as messenger, We would have made him in the form of a man as well, and would have thus added to their confusion.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "And had We made him an angel, We would still have made him a man, and We would have confounded for them that which they are confounding.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "Had We made him an angel, We would have surely made him a man, and We would have surely confounded them just as they confound [the truth now].\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "If We had made it an angel, We should have sent him as a man, and We should certainly have caused them confusion in a matter which they have already covered with confusion.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "And had We appointed him an angel, We indeed would have made him a man, and We would have certainly caused them confusion in a matter which they have already covered with confusion (i.e. the Message of Prophet Muhammad SAW).\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "If We had made him an angel, We would have given him the resemblance of a man, and would have as such confused them with that in which they are already confused.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "Had We made him an angel, We would have made him a man, and confused them when they are already confused.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Had We appointed an angel) as Our messenger, (We assuredly had made him (as) a man) in the form of a man such that they are able to look at him; (and (thus) obscured for them) the real form of the angel ((as) they (now) obscure) the traits and description of Muhammad.\n"
