        "TRANSLATION_0": "No, it is simply that what they were concealing before has been shown to them; and if they were sent back they would merely return to what they were forbidden to do. Truly they are liars.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "But no. What they were hiding has now become clear to them. If they were sent back they would surely return to what had been forbidden them, for surely they are liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "No! They will say this merely because the Truth which they had concealed will become obvious to them; or else if they were sent back, they would still revert to what was forbidden to them. (So this plea of theirs would be a lie too) for they are just liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Whatever they had concealed will be revealed to them. If they were to return to (the worldly life), they would again worship idols, for they are liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "In fact it has become clear to them what they used to hide before; and were they to be sent back, they would commit the same which they were forbidden to, and undoubtedly they are liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Nay, what they had been concealing before has become manifest to them. But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "Nay, what they concealed before shall become manifest to them; and if they were sent back, they would certainly go back to that which they are forbidden, and most surely they are liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "No; that which they were concealing before has now appeared to them; and even if they were returned, they would again commit the very thing they were prohibited; they are truly liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Nay, but that hath become clear unto them which before they used to hide. And if they were sent back they would return unto that which they are forbidden. Lo! they are liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "The truth they used to hide will become all too clear to them. But if they were sent back, they would return to what they had been forbidden. For they are indeed liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "Yea! manifest hath become unto them that which they were erst wont to hide. And were they sent back they would surely return to that which was prohibited to them, and verily they are perfect liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "Indeed, what they used to hide before has now become evident to them. But were they to be sent back they would revert to what they were forbidden, and they are indeed liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "Yea, in their own (eyes) will become manifest what before they concealed. But if they were returned, they would certainly relapse to the things they were forbidden, for they are indeed liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "Nay, it has become manifest to them what they had been concealing before. But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars.\n",

[Q. 6:23]) has now become evident to them, as their limbs have borne witness [against them], and so they [now] wish for that [mentioned in the previous verse]; and even if, hypothetically, they were returned, to the world, they would return to that which they are forbidden, of idolatry; they are truly liars, when they promise that they would believe [if they were to be returned].\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Nay, but that) their punishment (hath become clear unto them which before) in the life of this world (they used to hide) their disbelief and idolatry. (And if they were sent back) to the life of this world, as they request (they would return unto that which they are forbidden) their disbelief and idolatry. (Lo! they are liars) because were they to be returned, they would still not believe.\n"
