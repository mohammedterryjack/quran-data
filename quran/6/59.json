And no soul knows what it has earned for the morrow; nor does any soul know in what land it will die. Truly God is Knowing, Aware, Q. 31:34], as reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b. He knows what is, happening, on land, [in] the deserts, and in the waters, [in] the towns along the rivers; and not a leaf (min waraqatin: min is extra) falls, but He knows it. Not a grain in the shadows of the earth, nothing of wet or dry ([this entire clause] wa-l\u0101 habbatin f\u012b zulum\u0101ti l-ardi wa-l\u0101 ratbin wa-l\u0101 y\u0101bisin is a supplement to waraqatin, \u2018a leaf\u2019) but it is in a clear book, namely, the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahf\u016bz). The exceptive clause [ill\u0101 f\u012b kit\u0101bin mub\u012bn, \u2018but it is in a clear book\u2019] constitutes an inclusive substitution for the previous exceptive clause [ill\u0101 ya\u2018lamuh\u0101, \u2018but He knows it\u2019].\n",

(None but He knoweth them) no one knows the keys of the unseen: when the punishment for which you are impatient will come down on you. (And He knoweth what is in the land and the sea) of created beings and marvels; it is also said that this means: Allah knows what He destroys in the land and in the sea. (Not a leaf falleth) from a tree (but He knoweth it) He knows how many times it spins in the air before it falls, (not a grain amid the darkness of the earth) under a rock at the bottom of the earth except that He knows it, (naught of wet) i.e. water (or dry) steppe (but (it is noted) in a) written (clear record) all of it is in the Guarded Tablet: with their precise measure and time.\n"
