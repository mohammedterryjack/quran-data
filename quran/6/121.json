        "TRANSLATION_1": "Do not eat of that over which God's name has not been pronounced, for that would amount to exceeding the limits of law. Certainly the devils inspire their proteges to dispute with you: If you obey them, you will surely become an idolater.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Do not eat of (the animal) over which the name of Allah has not been pronounced (at the time of its slaughtering), for that is a transgression. And behold, the evil ones do inspire doubts and objections into the hearts of their friends so that they dispute with you; but if you obey them, you will surely yourselves turn into those who associate others with Allah in His divinity.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Do not eat the flesh of an animal which has been slaughtered without a mention of the Name of God; it is a sinful deed. Satan teaches his friends to argue with you. If you obey them, you will certainly be idol worshippers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And do not eat that on which Allah\u2019s name has not been mentioned, and indeed that is disobedience; and undoubtedly the devils inspire in the hearts of their friends to fight with you; and if you obey them, you are then polytheists.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_6": "And do not eat of that on which Allah's name has not been mentioned, and that is most surely a transgression; and most surely the Shaitans suggest to their friends that they should contend with you; and if you obey them, you shall most surely be polytheists.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "And eat not of that over which God's Name has not been mentioned; it is ungodliness. The Satans inspire their friends to dispute with you; if you obey them, you are idolaters.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "And eat not of that whereon Allah's name hath not been mentioned, for lo! it is abomination. Lo! the devils do inspire their minions to dispute with you. But if ye obey them, ye will be in truth idolaters.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "and do not eat anything over which God's name has not been pronounced, for that surely is disobedience. The devils inspire their followers to argue with you. If you obey them, you will become of those who associate partners with God.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "And eat not of that whereon the name of Allah hath not been pronounced; for verily that is a departure. Verily the Satans are ever inspiring their friends that they may wrangle with you; and were ye to obey them, verily ye shall become associaters indeed.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_13": "Eat not (O believers) of that (meat) on which Allah's Name has not been pronounced (at the time of the slaughtering of the animal), for sure it is Fisq (a sin and disobedience of Allah). And certainly, the Shayatin (devils) do inspire their friends (from mankind) to dispute with you, and if you obey them [by making Al-Maytatah (a dead animal) legal by eating it], then you would indeed be Mushrikun (polytheists) [because they (devils and their friends) made lawful to you to eat that which Allah has made unlawful to eat and you obeyed them by considering it lawful to eat, and by doing so you worshipped them, and to worship others besides Allah is polytheism].\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "Do not eat from that which the Name of Allah has not been mentioned, for it is a sin. The satans will reveal to their guided ones to argue with you. If you obey them, you shall indeed become idolaters.\n",

And truly the devils inspire, whisper [to], their friends, the disbelievers, to dispute with you, in deeming carrion lawful; and if you obey them, in this [matter], you are truly idolaters.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And eat not of that whereon Allah's name hath not been mentioned) of immolated animals intentionally, (for lo! it is abomination) i.e. eating it without a necessity is a sin and declaring it lawful, in denial of the revelation, is an act of disbelief. (Lo! the devils do inspire) whisper to (their minions) Abu'l-Ahwas and his folk (to dispute with you) regarding the consumption of the meat of carrion, idolatry and about the angels being the daughters of Allah. (But if you obey them) in their idolatry and the consumption of the meat of carrion, declaring it lawful without being in dire need of it, (ye will be in truth idolaters) like them.\n"
