Or, is it meant as a eulogy, or both? These are three possibilities, the most likely of which is the last, as the Shaykh [Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Mahall\u012b] states in [his commentary on] s\u016brat alKahf [Q. 18:1]; Who created the heavens and the earth \u2014 He singles out these two for mention because for the observer they constitute the most awesome [visible] creation; and He appointed, He created, darknesses and light, that is, every darkness (zulma) and every light: the use of the plural only in the case of the former is because it [darkness] has many causes; and this is one of the proofs of His Oneness; then those who disbelieve, despite the existence of this proof, ascribe equals to their Lord, they worship others equally.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "And on his authority from Ibn 'Abbas, regarding Allah's saying (Praise be to Allah) he said: '(Praise be to Allah) Allah says: gratitude and godhood are Allah's, (Who hath created the heavens) in two days: Sunday 131 and Monday (and the earth) in two days: Tuesday and Wednesday, (and has appointed darkness and light) He created faith and disbelief or night and day. (Yet those who disbelieve) the unbelievers of Mecca (ascribe rivals) idols (unto their Lord).\n"
