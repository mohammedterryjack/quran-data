        "TRANSLATION_1": "Indeed it is God who splits up the seed and the kernel, and brings forth the living from the dead, the dead from the living. This is God: So whither do you stray?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Truly it is Allah Who causes the grain and the fruit-kernel to sprout. He brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living. Such is Allah. So whither are you tending in error?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "It is God who makes all kinds of seeds grow, brings forth the living from the dead, and the dead from the living. It is God who does such things, so how can you turn away from Him?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Indeed it is Allah Who splits the grain and the seed; it is He Who brings forth living from the dead, and it is He Who brings forth dead from the living; such is Allah; so where are you reverting?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Verily! It is Allah Who causes the seed grain and the fruit stone to split and sprout. He brings forth the living from the dead, and it is He Who brings forth the dead from the living. Such is Allah, then how are you deluded away from the truth\n",

Allah (it is) who spliteth the grain) i.e. He creates all kinds of grains; it is also said that this means: He creates that which is in the grains (of corn and the date-stone (for sprouting)) just as He creates all that which contains stones. (He bringeth forth the living from the dead) He brings forth living creatures and beasts from sperm drops; it is also said that this means: He creates birds from eggs; and it is said that this means: He creates a spike of grain and fruits from grains and stones, (and is the bringer forth of the dead from the living) He brings forth sperms from living creatures and beasts; it is also said that this means: He creates eggs from birds; and it is said that this means: He creates grains from corn and fruits. (Such) who does this (is Allah) and not any other god. (How then are you perverted) why then do you lie?\n"
