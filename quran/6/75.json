The adversaries are told that they can observe God's signs in the phenomena of the universe, just as Abraham could.

The sun, moon and stars which rise and set before their eyes day after day and night after night witness them as misguided at their setting as at their rising. Yet the same signs were observed by the perceptive Abraham, and the physical phenomena helped him arrive at the Truth.\n",
