(Now hath there come unto you a clear proof) a clarification (from your Lord) i.e. the Qur'an and the Messenger, (a guidance) from error (and a mercy) for the one who believes in him; (and who doeth greater wrong) who is more insolent and more daring vis-a-vis Allah (than he who denieth the revelations of Allah) who denies Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, (and turneth away from them? We award unto those who turn away from Our revelations) Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (an evil doom) a severe torment (because of their aversion) vis-a-vis Muhammad and the Qur'an.\n"
