The meaning is: there is nothing to prevent you from eating what has been mentioned, for He has explained to you what is forbidden for consumption, and that [over which God\u2019s Name has been invoked] is not among these [forbidden things]. But truly many are led astray (read la-yadill\u016bna, \u2018[many] are led astray\u2019, or la-yudill\u016bna, \u2018[many] lead [others] astray\u2019), by their whims, by what their own selves fancy, in the way of permitting [the consumption of] carrion and otherwise, without any knowledge, with which to support their claims. Truly your Lord knows the transgressors, those who overstep [the bounds] of what is lawful into what is unlawful.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(How should ye not eat of that over which the name of Allah hath been mentioned) of immolated animals, (when He hath explained unto you that which is forbidden unto you) such as the meat of carrion, blood and pork, (unless you are compelled thereto) except if you are forced to eat the meat of carrion. (But lo! Many) Abu'l-Ahwas and his folk (are led astray by their own lusts) call on you to eat the meat of carrion (through ignorance) or proof. (Lo! your Lord, He is best aware of the transgressors) who move from the lawful to that which is unlawful.\n"
