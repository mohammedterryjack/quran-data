While 'Uyaynah was inviting them to idolatry. It is also said that this verse was revealed about Abu Bakr and his son 'Abd al-Rahman. Prior to embracing Islam, 'Abd al-Rahman used to invite his parents to his religion. Allah said to his Prophet: tell Abu Bakr to say to his son 'Abd al- Rahman: are you asking us 'Abd al-Rahman, to worship, instead of Allah, that which does not benefit us in this world in our provision or livelihood or in the Hereafter if we were to worship it, nor hurt us, if we did not worship it? Are you really asking us to return to our old religion after Allah has guided us to the religion of Muhammad (pbuh). If we were to do as you ask us, we would be like 'Abd al-Rahman who erred and whom the devils lured away from Allah's religion. The parents of 'Abd al-Rahman-Abu Bakr and his wife-invited him to Islam and repentance, while he invited them to idolatry. His parents say to him: obey us and embrace Islam. (Say) Muhammad: (Lo! the guidance of Allah is Guidance) the religion of Allah is Islam and our Qiblah is the Ka'bah, (and we are ordered to surrender) to make our worship and confession of Allah's divine Oneness sincere (to the Lord of the Worlds) to Allah, Lord of the Worlds,\n"
