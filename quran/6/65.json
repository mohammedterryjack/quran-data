Q. 11:67], or from beneath your feet, such as the causing of the earth to cave in [cf. Q. 29:40], or to confound you, to confuse you, in parties, sects with differing whims, and to make you taste the violence of one another\u2019, through fighting. When this [verse] was revealed, the Prophet (s) said, \u2018This [chastisement etc.] is easier and lighter\u2019; but when the last statement was revealed, he said, \u2018I seek refuge with Your Countenance!\u2019, as reported by al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b. Muslim reports the [following] had\u012bth: \u2018I requested from my Lord not to make my community violent towards each other, but He denied me this [request]\u2019. In another had\u012bth, when it was revealed, he [is reported to have] said, \u2018As for this, it will surely come to pass, even though its proper meaning has not yet come\u2019. See how We dispense, [how] We clarify for them, the signs, the proofs of Our power, that perhaps they might understand, that they might realise that what they follow is falsehood.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Say) to them, Muhammad: (He is able to send punishment upon you from above you) as He did on the people of Noah and the people of Lot (or from beneath your feet) or make the earth swallow you as it swallowed Korah, (or to bewilder you with dissension) make divide into conflicting sects as He did with the Children of Israel after the prophets (and make you taste the tyranny) the sword of (one of another. See) Muhammad (how We display the revelations) how We expound in the Qur'an the events of past nations and that which We did with them (so that they may understand) so that they may understand Allah's commands and His divine Oneness.\n"
