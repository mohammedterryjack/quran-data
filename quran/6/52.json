        "TRANSLATION_0": "Do not chase away those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His Face. Their reckoning is in no way your responsibility and your reckoning is in no way their responsibility. Indeed if you did chase them away, you would be among the wrongdoers.",

The idolaters had reviled them and demanded that he [the Prophet] expel them, so that they could sit with him. The Prophet (s) wanted [to do] this, because of his desire that they become Muslims. You are not accountable for them in anything (min shay\u2019in: min is extra), if what they hide in themselves be displeasing; nor are they accountable for you in anything, that you should drive them away (this is the response to the negative sentence) and be of the evildoers, if you do this.\n",

(Thou art not accountable for them) for their provision (in aught, nor are they accountable for you) for your provision (in aught, that thou shouldst repel them and be of the wrong-doers) of those who harm themselves.\n"
