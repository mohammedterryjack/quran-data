He used to visit al-H\u012bra for commerce and purchase books containing the stories of the non-Arab peoples and then recount these to the people of Mecca. He would say, \u2018Muhammad recounts to you the stories of \u2018\u0100d and Tham\u016bd, whereas I relate to you the stories of the Persians and the Byzantines!\u2019 They would thus [go to] enjoy his stories and neglect to listen to the Qur\u2019\u0101n.\n",
