And none denies Our signs, an example of which is Our delivering [them] from [such treacherous] waves, except every perfidious ingrate, [ungrateful] for God\u2019s graces, exalted be He.\n",

But when He bringeth them safe to land, some of them) some of the disbelievers (compromise) in their speech and works, such that they are softer than they were. (None denieth Our signs) Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (save every traitor ingrate) who disbelieves in Allah and is ungrateful for His bounties.\n"
