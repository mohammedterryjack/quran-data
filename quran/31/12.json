In other words, [We gave him wisdom] and We said to him: \u2018Give thanks to God, for the wisdom that He has given you. Whoever gives thanks only for his own sake, because the reward for his gratitude shall be his, and whoever is ungrateful, for a grace, then surely God is Independent, [without need] of His creation, Praised\u2019, in what He does.\n",
