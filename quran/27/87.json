According to Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s, however, these [excepted individuals] are the martyrs who are [described as], living with their Lord, provided for [by Him]\u2019 [Q. 3:169]. And all (kullun: the nunation compensates for the [missing] genitive annexation), in other words, and every one of them, after being brought back to life on the Day of Resurrection, will come to Him (read in the form of the verb [atawhu] or the active participle [\u0101t\u016bhu]) in [utter] humility, humbled (the past tense, atawhu, is used to express the fact that this will have happened).\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And (remind them of) the Day when the Trumpet will be blown) this is the blowing of death, (and all who are in the heavens) the angels (and the earth) of created beings (will start in fear) will die, (save him whom Allah wills) from among the dwellers of heaven: Gabriel, Michael, Seraphiel and the angel of death, for these will not die upon the first blowing of the Trumpet, but they will die after that. (And all) i.e. the dwellers of the heavens and earth (come unto Him, humbled) they will come to Allah on the Day of Judgement abased and humbled.\n"
