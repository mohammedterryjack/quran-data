He informed his Companions of this and they rejoiced. But when they set off with him [from Medina], and the disbelievers impeded them at al-Hudaybiyya such that they had to retreat, which was distressing for them, for some of the hypocrites began to have doubts [about the Prophet\u2019s sincerity], this [verse] was revealed (bi\u2019l-haqqi, \u2018in all truth\u2019, is semantically connected to sadaqa, \u2018fulfilled\u2019, or it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-ru\u2019y\u0101, \u2018the vision\u2019, and what comes after it is the explanation thereof): \u2018You will assuredly enter the Sacred Mosque, God willing \u2014 this is [said] to secure blessings \u2014 in safety, to shave your heads, that is, all the hair, or to shorten [it], [to shorten] some of the hair (both muhalliq\u012bna and muqassir\u012bna are implied circumstantial qualifiers), without any fear\u2019, ever. So He knew, [there to be] in the truce, what you did not know, in the way of reconciliation [between the believers and the Meccans], and assigned [you] before that, entry, a near victory, namely, the conquest of Khaybar \u2014 the vision was fulfilled in the following year.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Allah hath fulfilled the vision for His messenger in very truth) truly. This is because the Prophet (pbuh) had told his Companions: (Ye shall indeed enter the Inviolable Place of Worship, if Allah will, secure) from the enemy, ((having your hair) shaven and cut, not fearing) the enemy; and Allah did fulfil what the Prophet (pbuh) had said to his Companions. (But He knoweth that which ye know not) Allah had known that what he promised was not to take place in that year but in the following year, while you did not know this, (and hath given you a near victory beforehand) i.e. the conquest of Khaybar before the fulfilment of this vision.\n"
