Had it not been for (the presence of) believers, men and women, (among the unbelievers) of whom you were unaware, and whom you might have trampled and thus incurred guilt unknowingly on account of them, (the matter would have been settled).

God would not have kept you from fighting the disbelievers, had there not been believing men and women (among them) whom you did not know and whom you might have unknowingly harmed. God did this because He grants mercy to whomever He wants. Had they been distinguishable from the believers, We would certainly have punished them with a painful torment.\n",

And were it not for [some of] the believing men and believing women, being present at Mecca alongside the disbelievers, whom you did not know, to be believers \u2014 lest you should trample them, that is to say, [lest] you should slay them together with the disbelievers, had you been given permission to embark on the conquest (an tata\u2019\u016bhum is an inclusive substitution for \u2013hum, \u2018them\u2019 [of lam ta\u2018lam\u016bhum, \u2018whom you did not know\u2019]), and thus incur sin on account of them without, your, knowing, it \u2026 (the third person pronouns in both groups [of people] predominantly   imply males; the response to lawl\u0101, \u2018were it not\u2019, has been omitted [through ellipsis], being [something along the lines of] la-udhina lakum f\u012b\u2019l-fathi, \u2018you would have been permitted to embark on the conquest\u2019), but permission for this was not given at the time, so that God may admit into His mercy whom He will, such as those believers mentioned. Had they been clearly separated, [had] they [the believers] been distinguishable from the disbelievers, We would have surely chastised the disbelievers among them, of the people of Mecca [immediately] thereat, by permitting you to go ahead with the conquest thereof, with a painful chastisement.\n",

(And if it had not been for believing men) al-Walid and Salamah the sons of Hisham, 'Ayyash Ibn Rabi'ah and Abu Jandal Ibn Suhayl Ibn 'Amr (and believing women) in Mecca, (whom ye know not lest ye should tread them under foot) lest you should kill (and thus incur) because of killing (guilt for them) blood money and the sin of killing them; (unknowingly) without knowing that they were believers, if it were not for that, Allah would have set you on them to kill them; (that Allah might bring into His mercy) that Allah may honour with His religion (whom He will) whoever deserves it. (If (the believers and the disbelievers) had been clearly separated) if the believers had moved out from among the disbelievers (We verily had punished those of them who disbelieved) the disbelievers of Mecca (with painful punishment) with your swords. 599\n"
