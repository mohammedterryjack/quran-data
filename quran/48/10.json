        "TRANSLATION_0": "Those who pledge you their allegiance pledge allegiance to Allah. Allah's hand is over their hands. He who breaks his pledge only breaks it against himself. But as for him who fulfils the contract he has made with Allah, We will pay him an immense reward.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Those who swear allegiance to you indeed swear allegiance to God; and God's protection is over them. Then whosoever breaks the promise breaks it to his own loss; but whosoever fulfills the promise made to God will receive a great reward from Him.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Those who swore fealty to you, (O Prophet), in fact swore fealty to Allah. The Hand of Allah is above their hands. So whoever breaks his covenant breaks it to his own hurt; and whoever fulfils the covenant that he made with Allah, He will bestow on him a great reward.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Those who pledge obedience to you are, in fact, pledging obedience to God. The hands of God are above their hands. As for those who disregard their pledge, they do so only against their own souls. Those who fulfill their promise to God will receive a great reward.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Those who swear allegiance to you (O dear Prophet Mohammed \u2013 peace and blessings be upon him), do indeed in fact swear allegiance to Allah; Allah's Hand* of Power is above their hands; so whoever breaches his oath, has breached his own greater promise; and whoever fulfils the covenant he has with Allah \u2013 so very soon Allah will bestow upon him a great reward. (Used as a metaphor.)\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Verily, those who give pledge to you, they are giving pledge to Allah. The Hand of Allah is over their hands. Then whosoever breaks his pledge, breaks it only to his own harm; and whosoever fulfills what he has the covenants he makes with Allah, He will bestow on him a great reward.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "Surely those who swear allegiance to you do but swear allegiance to Allah; the hand of Allah is above their hands. Therefore whoever breaks (his faith), he breaks it only to the injury of his own soul, and whoever fulfills what he has covenanted with Allah, He will grant him a mighty reward.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "Those who swear fealty to thee swear fealty in truth to God; God's hand is over their hands. Then whosoever breaks his oath breaks it but to his own hurt; and whoso fulfils his covenant made with God, God will give him a mighty wage.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Lo! those who swear allegiance unto thee (Muhammad), swear allegiance only unto Allah. The Hand of Allah is above their hands. So whosoever breaketh his oath, breaketh it only to his soul's hurt; while whosoever keepeth his covenant with Allah, on him will He bestow immense reward.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "Behold, all who pledge their allegiance to you indeed pledge their allegiance to God: the hand of God is over their hands. Hence, he who breaks his oath, breaks it only to his own loss. Whereas he who remains true to what he has pledged to God, shall have a great reward bestowed upon him by God.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "Verily those who swear fealty Unto thee, only swear fealty Unto Allah: the hand of Allah is over their hands. So whosoever breaketh his oath, breaketh it only to his soul's hurt; and whosoever fulfilleth that which he hath convenanted with Allah, him anon He shall give a mighty hire.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "Indeed those who swear allegiance to you, swear allegiance only to Allah: the hand of Allah is above their hands. Then whosoever breaks his oath, breaks it only to his own detriment, and whoever fulfills the covenant he has made with Allah, He will give him a great reward.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "Verily those who plight their fealty to thee do no less than plight their fealty to Allah: the Hand of Allah is over their hands: then any one who violates his oath, does so to the harm of his own soul, and any one who fulfils what he has covenanted with Allah,- Allah will soon grant him a great Reward.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "Verily, those who give Bai'a (pledge) to you (O Muhammad SAW) they are giving Bai'a (pledge) to Allah. The Hand of Allah is over their hands. Then whosoever breaks his pledge, breaks only to his own harm, and whosoever fulfills what he has covenanted with Allah, He will bestow on him a great reward.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "Those who swear allegiance to you swear allegiance to Allah. The Hand of Allah is above their hands. He who breaks his oath breaks it against his self, but for he that keeps his covenant made with Allah, Allah shall give him a mighty wage.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "Those who pledge allegiance to you are pledging allegiance to God. The hand of God is over their hands. Whoever breaks his pledge breaks it to his own loss. And whoever fulfills his covenant with God, He will grant him a great reward.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "Indeed, those who pledge allegiance to you, [O Muhammad] - they are actually pledging allegiance to Allah. The hand of Allah is over their hands. So he who breaks his word only breaks it to the detriment of himself. And he who fulfills that which he has promised Allah - He will give him a great reward.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[48:10] Truly those who pledge allegiance to you, the \u2018Pledge of Beatitude\u2019 (bay\u2018at al-ridw\u0101n) given at alHudaybiyya, in fact pledge allegiance to God \u2014 this [statement] is akin to: Whoever obeys the Messenger, verily obeys God [Q. 4:80]. The Hand of God is above their hands, [the hands] with which they pledged allegiance to the Prophet, in other words, God, exalted be He, has observed their pledge of allegiance and will requite them in accordance with [their adherence to] it. So whoever reneges, [whoever] breaches the pledge, reneges \u2014 [that is] the evil consequences of his breach will eventually be \u2014 against his own soul; and whoever fulfils the covenant which he has made with God, He will give him (fa-sa-yu\u2019t\u012bhi; or read fa-sanu\u2019t\u012bhi, \u2018We will give him\u2019) a great reward.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Then He mentioned the pact of Ridwan at al-Hudaybiyyah which took place under a tree, the Samurah tree; those present at this pact were about 1500 people, and swore allegiance to the Prophet of Allah which, among others, entailed giving counsel, help and not running away [in war]. Allah said: (Lo! those who swear allegiance unto thee (Muhammad)) on the Day of al-Hudaybiyyah, (swear allegiance only unto Allah) it is as if they swear allegiance to Allah. (The Hand of Allah) in terms of reward and help (is above their hands) in relation to truthfulness, fulfilment and completion. (So whosoever breaketh his oath, breaketh it only to his soul's hurt) the punishment of this breaking is against his soul; (while whosoever keepeth his covenant with Allah) and remain truthful and loyal, (on him will He bestow immense reward) on him Allah bestows abundant reward in Paradise. None of those who swore allegiance broke his oath, because they were all sincere and died honouring the allegiance of Ridwan. That is to say to the exception of one man named Jadd Ibn Qays, a hypocrite, who hid on that day behind his camel and did not join in when the swearing of allegiance took place. Allah made him die in his state of hypocrisy.\n"
