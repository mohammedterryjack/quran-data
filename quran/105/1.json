He had built a church in San\u2018\u0101\u2019 in order to divert pilgrims away from Mecca to it. A man from among the Ban\u016b Kin\u0101na defecated in it and stained its prayer niche with a deflowered virgin\u2019s blood, in contempt of it. Abraha then swore that he would knock down the Ka\u2018ba. So he approached Mecca with his troops riding Yemeni elephants with Mahm\u016bd at the vanguard.
