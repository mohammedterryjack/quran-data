        "TRANSLATION_1": "The true way with God is peace; and the people of the Book did not differ until knowledge (of this revelation) had come to them, out of mutual opposition. But those who deny the signs of God (should remember) He is swift in the reckoning.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "The true religion with Allah is Islam. The People of the Book adopted many different ways rather than follow the true way of Islam even after the knowledge of truth had reached them, and this merely to commit excesses against one another. Let him who refuses to follow the ordinances and directives of Allah know that Allah is swift in His reckoning.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "In the sight of God Islam is the religion. The People of the Book created differences in the matters (of religion) because of their hostility among themselves, only after knowledge had come to them. Let whoever denies the revelations of God know that the reckoning of God is swift.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Indeed the only true religion in the sight of Allah is Islam; those who had received the Books differed only after the knowledge came to them, due to their hearts\u2019 envy; and whoever disbelieves in the signs of Allah, then Allah is Swift At Taking Account.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam. Those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) did not differ except out of rivalry, after knowledge had come to them. And whoever disbelieves in the Ayat of Allah, then surely, Allah is Swift in reckoning.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "Surely the (true) religion with Allah is Islam, and those to whom the Book had been given did not show opposition but after knowledge had come to them, out of envy among themselves; and whoever disbelieves in the communications of Allah then surely Allah is quick in reckoning.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "The true religion with God is Islam. Those who were given the Book were not at variance except after the knowledge came to them, being insolent one to another. And whoso disbelieves in God's signs. God is swift at the reckoning.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Lo! religion with Allah (is) the Surrender (to His Will and Guidance). Those who (formerly) received the Scripture differed only after knowledge came unto them, through transgression among themselves. Whoso disbelieveth the revelations of Allah (will find that) lo! Allah is swift at reckoning.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "The only true religion in God's sight is complete submission to God. And those who were given the Book disagreed only out of rivalry, after knowledge had been given to them -- he who denies God's signs should know that God is swift in His reckoning.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "Verily the religion with Allah is Islam and those Who Were vouchsafed the Book differed Not save after the knowledge had come unto them, out of spite among themselves. And whosoever disbelieveth in the revelations of Allah, then verily Allah swift at reckoning.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "Indeed, with Allah religion is Islam, and those who were given the Book did not differ except after knowledge had come to them, out of envy among themselves. And whoever denies Allah\u2019s signs [should know that] Allah is swift at reckoning.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "The Religion before Allah is Islam (submission to His Will): Nor did the People of the Book dissent therefrom except through envy of each other, after knowledge had come to them. But if any deny the Signs of Allah, Allah is swift in calling to account.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_14": "The only religion with Allah is Islam (submission). Those to whom the Book was given disagreed among themselves only after knowledge had been given to them being insolent among themselves. He who disbelieves the verses of Allah indeed Allah is Swift in reckoning.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_17": "[3:19] Lo!, the religion with God, pleasing [to Him], is submission [to the One God], (al-isl\u0101m), that is to say, the Divine Law with which the messengers were sent, founded upon the affirmation of God\u2019s Oneness (a variant reading [for inna, \u2018lo!\u2019] has anna, \u2018that\u2019, as an inclusive substitution for annahu to the end [of that verse, sc. shahida Ll\u0101hu \u2026 anna l-d\u012bna \u2018inda Ll\u0101hi l-isl\u0101m, \u2018God bears witness that religion with God is Isl\u0101m]). Those who were given the Scripture, the Jews and the Christians, differed, in religion, some affirming God\u2019s Oneness, others rejecting it, only after the knowledge, of Oneness, came to them through transgression, on the part of the disbelievers, among themselves. And whoever disbelieves in God\u2019s signs, God is swift at reckoning, that is, at requiting him.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Lo! Religion) that is accepted (with Allah (is) the Surrender (to His will and guidance)). It is also said that this should be understood as: Allah bears witness that Religion with Him is Islam (the Surrender), and the angels, the prophets and the believers also bear witness to this. This verse was revealed about two men from Historic Syria who asked the Prophet (pbuh) which is the greatest witness in the Book of Allah. When he informed them about it, they embraced Islam. (Those who (formerly) received the Scripture) the Jews and Christians (differed) about Islam and Muhammad (only after knowledge) the exposition of what is in their Scripture (came unto them, through transgression among themselves) out of resentful envy. (Whoso disbelieveth the revelations of Allah) Muhammad and the Qur'an ((will find that) Lo! Allah is swift at reckoning) severe in His punishment.\n"
