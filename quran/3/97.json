Among these [signs] are the fact that the reward for good deeds is multiplied in it and that birds never fly over it; and whoever enters it is in security, not liable therein to be killed or oppressed or otherwise. It is the duty of people towards God to make the pilgrimage to the House (read either as hijj al-bayt or hajj al-bayt, as two variants of the verbal noun from hajj, meaning \u2018the intention [to journey there]\u2019), if he is able to make his way there (man istat\u0101\u2018a ilayhi sab\u012blan substitutes for al-n\u0101s, \u2018people\u2019). The Prophet (s) explained this [ability] as having provisions and a ride, as reported by alH\u0101kim [al-Nays\u0101b\u016br\u012b] and others. As for the one who disbelieves, in God or in what He has made obligatory with regard to the Pilgrimage, God is Independent of all worlds, the humans, the jinn and the angels, and [is Independent of] their devotions.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Wherein are plain memorials) clear signs; and it contains (the place where Abraham stood up to pray) as well as the semi-circular wall of white marble (Hatim) of Ishmael and the black stone; (and whosoever entereth it is safe) from violence. (And to the House) going to the House (is a duty unto Allah for mankind) for the believers, (for him who can find a way thither) for the person who can walk and reach the House while at the same time being in possession of provisions, a mount and has left enough expenditure for his dependents until he returns. (As for him who disbelieveth) in Allah, Muhammad, the Qur'an and the obligation of pilgrimage, (Lo! Allah is Independent of (all) creatures) He is not in need of their belief or pilgrimage.\n"
