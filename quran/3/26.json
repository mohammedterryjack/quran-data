(Thou exaltest whom Thou wilt) i.e. Muhammad (and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, the people of Persia and the people of Byzantium. (In Thy hand is the good) exaltation, abasement, sovereignty, spoils, triumph and power. (Lo! Thou art Able to do all things) whether it is exaltation, abasement, sovereignty, spoils, triumph or power. This verse was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, the hypocrite, who said after the Conquest of Mecca: \"How on earth can they have sovereignty over Persia and Byzantium?\" It is also said that it was revealed about the Quraysh who said: \"the king of Persia sleeps on couches made of silk brocade, if you are truly a prophet, show us your dominion?\"\n"
