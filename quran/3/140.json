        "TRANSLATION_1": "If you have been wounded they too have suffered a wound. We cause this alternation of night and day in the affairs of men so that God may know those who believe, taking some as witness (of truth) from your ranks, for God does not like those who are unjust.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "If a wound has befallen you a similar wound has already befallen the people who are opposed to you. We make such movements to men in turn so that Allah might mark out those who are the true men of faith and select from among you those who do really bear witness (to the Truth): for Allah does not love the wrong-doers,\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "If you get hurt, certainly others have also experienced injuries. We have made people pass through the different turns of history so that God would know the true believers, have some of you bear witness to the people's deeds, {God does not love the unjust}\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "If you have been struck by some misfortune, so they (the disbelievers) too have been struck earlier with the same misfortune; these are the days in which We have allotted turns to people; and so that Allah may make known the believers and may bestow martyrdom to some of you; and Allah does not befriend the unjust.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "If a wound has touched you, be sure a similar wound has touched the others. And so are the days, that We give to men by turns, that Allah may know (test) those who believe, and that He may take martyrs from among you. And Allah likes not the wrongdoers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "If a wound has afflicted you (at Ohud), a wound like it has also afflicted the (unbelieving) people; and We bring these days to men by turns, and that Allah may know those who believe and take witnesses from among you; and Allah does not love the unjust.\n",

Such days We deal out in turn, We dispense them, among mankind, one day for one group, the next day for another, that they might be admonished, and that God may know, through knowledge manifested outwardly, those who believe, who are sincere in their faith from others; and that He may take witnesses from among you, honouring them with martyrdom, and God loves not the evildoers, the disbelievers, that is, He will chastise them, and the blessings He bestows upon them are only a [means of] drawing out [their punishment].\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(If ye have received a blow) if you were harmed on the Day of Uhud, (the (disbelieving) people) the people of Mecca (have received) on the Day of Badr (a blow) harm (the like thereof) like the harm you received on the Day of Uhud: (These are (only) the vicissitudes) the days of the life of this world (which We cause to follow one another for mankind) sometimes the believers have the upper hand over the unbelievers and sometimes it is the unbelievers who have the upper hand over the believers, (to the end that Allah may know) that He may see (those who believe) at the time of jihad (and may choose witnesses from among you) He honours whom He wills among you with martyrdom; (and Allah loveth not wrong-doers) He loves not the idolaters, their religion or their domination.\n"
