Let us call our sons and your sons, our wives and your wives, our selves and your selves, and gather them together, then let us humbly pray and invoke God\u2019s curse upon those who lie\u2019, by saying: \u2018Lord, curse the one that tells lies concerning the affair of Jesus\u2019. The Prophet (s) had called upon the Najr\u0101n delegation to do this when they disputed with him about Jesus. They said, \u2018Let us think about it and we will come back to you\u2019. The judicious one among them said, \u2018You know that he is a prophet, and that every people that has ever challenged a prophet to a mutual imprecation has been destroyed\u2019. They left him and departed. When they went to see the Prophet (s), who had set out with al-Hasan, al-Husayn, F\u0101tima and \u2018Al\u012b, he said to them [the Najr\u0101n delegation], \u2018When I supplicate, you say \u2018Amen\u2019; but they refrained from this mutual imprecation and made peace with the Prophet on the condition that they pay the jizya, as reported by Ab\u016b Nu\u2018aym. According to Ibn \u2018Abb\u0101s [the Prophet] said, \u2018Had they set out and performed the mutual cursing, they would have gone home and found neither possessions nor family\u2019. It is also reported that had they set out with this intention, they would have been consumed by fire.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Allah then mentioned the dispute of the delegation of Najran with the Prophet (pbuh) after he explained to them that the likeness of Jesus with Allah is as the likeness of Adam, for they said to the Prophet: it is not as you say that Jesus was not Allah, his son or His partner. As response Allah said: (And whoso disputeth with thee concerning him) concerning Jesus, (after the knowledge which has come unto thee) after the exposition that has come to you that Jesus was not Allah, His son or His partner, (say (unto him): Come! We will summon our sons and your sons) and you summon your sons, (and our women and your women) and you summon your women, (and ourselves and yourselves, then we will pray humbly (to our Lord)) and exert our effort in praying ((and (solemnly) invoke) all together (the curse of Allah upon those who lie) about Allah concerning Jesus.\n"
