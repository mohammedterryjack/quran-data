(Whoso deceiveth) as regards any of the booty (will bring his deceit with him) carried on his neck (on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul will be paid in full what it hath earned) that which it has deceived and also other things; (and they will not be wronged) their good works will not be diminished and their evil deeds will not be increased.\n"
