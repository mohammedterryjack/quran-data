(Will it be that, when he) Muhammad (dieth or is slain) in the way of Allah, (you will turn back on your heels?) you will return to your old religion. (He who turneth back) returns to his old religion (does no hurt to Allah) such return will not harm Allah, (and Allah will reward the thankful) He will reward the believers for their faith and jihad.\n"
