(They answered: If we knew) there was (aught of fighting we would follow you) to Uhud. (On that day they were nearer disbelief than faith) or the believers; it is also said that this means: their return to disbelief and the disbelievers was closer than their return to faith and the believers. (They utter with their mouths a thing which is not in their hearts) to corroborate it. (Allah is best aware of what they hide) of disbelief and hypocrisy.\n"
