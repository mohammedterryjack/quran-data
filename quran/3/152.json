Some of you desired this world, abandoning his station for the sake of the booty; and some of you desired the Hereafter, holding to it until he was slain, such as \u2018Abd All\u0101h b.

(Some of you) some of the archers (desired the world) with their jihad and fighting. This refers to those who abandoned their positions and rushed to gather the booty, (and some of you desired the Hereafter) with their jihad and fighting. This refers to 'Abdullah Ibn Jubayr and his fellow believers who remained at their positions until they were killed. (Therefore He made you flee from them) defeated and made them triumph over you, (that He might try you) that He might test you with the archers' disobedience. (Yet now He hath forgiven you) He did not exterminate you. (Allah is a Lord of Kindness to believers) in that He did not exterminate them, i.e. the archers. 73\n"
