        "TRANSLATION_17": "[3:37] Her Lord accepted the child, that is, He received Mary from her mother, with gracious acceptance, and made her grow excellently, He made her grow up with excellent character. She would grow in a day by as much as a new-born grew during a year. Her mother took her to the priests, the keepers of the Holy House [of Jerusalem] and said: \u2018This here before you is the dedication [I offered]\u2019. They competed for [guardianship of] her, because she was the daughter of their religious leader, at which point Zachariah said, \u2018I am most worthy of her, for, her maternal aunt lives with me\u2019. The others said, \u2018No, [not until] we have cast lots\u2019. Thus, all twenty nine of them departed to the River Jordan, where they cast their quills, agreeing that the one whose quill remained fast and floated to the surface of the water would be most worthy of [being guardian over] her. Zachariah\u2019s quill remained fast [and surfaced]. He took [charge of] her and built for her a gallery-room with a ladder in the temple, and none apart from him went up to her. He used to bring her food, drink and oil, and would find her with summer fruits in winter, and winter fruits in summer, just as God says, and Zachariah took charge of her, he took her to him (a variant reading [of kafalah\u0101, \u2018he took charge of her\u2019] is kaffalah\u0101, \u2018He [God] gave Zachariah charge of her\u2019, with Zakariyy\u0101\u2019, or Zakariyy\u0101, in the accusative and \u2018God\u2019 as the subject of the verb). Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary, that is, the room, the most noble seat [in the temple], where she was, he found her with provisions. \u2018O Mary,\u2019 he said, \u2018Whence comes this to you?\u2019 She, still very young, said, \u2018From God, He sends it to me from Paradise,\u2019 \u2018Truly God provides, abundant provision, for whomever He will without reckoning\u2019, without consequence.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And her Lord accepted her with full acceptance) He was good to her and accepted her instead of accepting a boy (and vouchsafed to her a goodly growth) He nurtured her well in worship throughout the years, months, days and hours; (and made Zachariah her guardian) he joined her to him for training. (Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary where she was) the room where she worshipped, (he found that she had food) the fruit of winter in the summer, such as culms of corn, and the fruits of summer in the winter such as grapes. (He said: Mary! Whence cometh unto thee this (food)?) how did you get this food out of its season? (She answered: It is from Allah) Gabriel brought it to me. (Allah giveth without stint) without pause or measure (to whom He will) in its season or out of it.\n"
