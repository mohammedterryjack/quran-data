Avoid them!) Yet if you endure, their harm, and fear, God by [not] befriending them and so on, their guile will not hurt you (read either l\u0101 yadirkum or l\u0101 yadurrukum) at all; God encompasses what they do (ya\u2018mal\u016bn, or may be read ta\u2018mal\u016bn, \u2018what you do\u2019), He has knowledge of it and will requite them for it.\n",

Allah is Surrounding) Allah knows (what they do) of contravention and enmity.\n"
