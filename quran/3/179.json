But Allah chooses those of His Messengers whom He wills. So have iman in Allah and His Messengers. If you have iman and taqwa you will have an immense reward.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "God will not leave the believers in the state they are in till He has sifted the evil from the good; nor will God reveal the secrets of the Unknown. He chooses (for this) from His apostles whom He will. So believe in God and the prophets, for if you believe and fear the displeasure of God your reward will be great.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Allah will not let the believers stay in the state they are: He will set the wicked apart from the good. Allah is not going to disclose to you what is hidden in the realm beyond the reach of perception, but He chooses from among His Messengers whom He wills (to intimate such knowledge). Believe, then, in Allah and in His Messengers; and if you believe and be come God-fearing, yours will be a great reward.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "God left the believers in their existing state for no other reason than to distinguish the evil-doers from the virtuous ones. God does not inform you of the unseen.

        "TRANSLATION_7": "God will not leave the believers in the state in which you are, till He shall distinguish the corrupt from the good, and God will not inform you of the Unseen; but God chooses out of His Messengers whom He will.

If you believe and practice piety, you will have a splendid reward.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "Allah would not leave the believers in that [state] you are in [presently] until He separates the evil from the good. Nor would Allah reveal to you the unseen. But [instead], Allah chooses of His messengers whom He wills, so believe in Allah and His messengers. And if you believe and fear Him, then for you is a great reward.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[3:179] It is not God\u2019s purpose to leave, to abandon, the believers in the state in which you, O people, are, where the sincere are intermingled with those otherwise, till He shall distinguish (read yam\u012bza or yumayyiza), [till] He separates, the evil one, the hypocrite, from the good, the believer, through the burdensome obligations that will reveal this [distinction] \u2014 He did this on the Day of Uhud. And it is not God\u2019s purpose to apprise you of the Unseen, so that you could recognise the hypocrites from the others, before the distinguishing; but God chooses, He selects, of His messengers whom He will, apprising him of [some of] His Unseen, as when He apprised the Prophet (s) of the position of the hypocrites. So believe in God and His messengers; and if you believe and guard against, hypocrisy, then yours shall be a great wage.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "With regard to the idolaters saying to Muhammad: \"You say to us that there are amongst us believers and unbelievers. Show us, Muhammad, who believes among us and who does not\", Allah then said: (It is not 77 (the purpose) of Allah to leave the believers) and unbelievers (in your present state) of religion until the believer becomes an unbeliever and the unbeliever becomes a believer if it is so in His decree (till He shall separate the wicked from the good) the damned from the felicitous, the unbeliever from the believer and the hypocrite from the sincere. (And it is not (the purpose of) Allah to let you know) people of Mecca (the unseen) such that you know who believes and who does not. (But Allah chooseth) selects (of His messengers whom He will) i.e. Muhammad, and informs him of some of the unseen through revelation. (So believe in Allah and His messengers) believe in all the messengers and Scriptures. (If ye believe) in Allah and all the Scriptures and messengers (and ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief and idolatry, (yours will be a vast reward) an abundant reward in Paradise.\n"
