(Allah will neither speak to them) in a nice manner on the Day of Judgement (nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection) He will have no mercy for them, (nor will He make them grow) He will neither exonerate them for being Jews nor put their minds at peace. (Theirs will be a painful doom) a severe pain which will spread to their hearts. It is also said that this was revealed about 'Abdan Ibn al-Ashu' and Imra' al-Qays because of a dispute between them, and it was also revealed about the Jews.\n"
