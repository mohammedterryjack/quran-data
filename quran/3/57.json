God loves not the evildoers, that is, He will chastise them. It is reported that God, exalted be He, sent him [Jesus] a cloud which raised him up, but his mother clutched to him in tears. He then said to her, \u2018Verily, the Resurrection shall bring us together again\u2019. This took place on the Night of Ordainment (laylat al-qadr) in the Holy House [of Jerusalem], when he was thirty three years old. His mother lived on after him for six years. The two Shaykhs [Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim] narrate a had\u012bth [in which it is stated] that he [Jesus] will descend when the Hour is nigh and will rule according to the Law of our Prophet [Muhammad], and that he will slay the false messiah and the swine, break the cross and impose the jizya. In a had\u012bth recorded by Muslim, he will remain for seven years; according to Ab\u016b D\u0101w\u016bd al-Tay\u0101lis\u012b, [he will remain for] forty years, and he will die and have prayers performed over him. It is possible that what is meant [by the forty years] is the total time he will have spent on earth, before he was raised and afterwards.\n",

(Allah loveth not wrong-doers) the idolaters, with their transgressions and association of partners with Allah.\n"
