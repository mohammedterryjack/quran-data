        "TRANSLATION_0": "The deen in the sight of Allah is Islam. Those given the Book only differed after knowledge had come to them, envying one another. As for those who reject Allah's Signs, Allah is swift at reckoning.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Even then if they argue, tell them: \"I have bowed in submission to God, and so have my followers.\" And tell the people of the Book and the Arabs: \"Do you submit?\" If they do, they will find the right path; if they turn away, your duty is to deliver the message. And God keeps an eye on His votaries.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "And if they remonstrate with you, tell them: 'I have submitted my whole being to Allah, and so have those who follow me.' And ask the People of the Book as well as those who follow no heavenly Scripture: 'Have you also submitted (to Allah)?' If they have submitted to Him, they are indeed on the right way but if they deviate from submitting to Allah, then your duty is merely to deliver the message. Allah observes the affairs of His servants.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "(Muhammad), if the People of the Book argue against you, say, \"I and those who follow me have submitted ourselves to God.\" Ask the People of the Book and the illiterate ones, \"Have you embraced Islam?\" If they embrace Islam, they will find guidance but if they turn away, your task is just to preach. God knows all about His servants.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Then if they argue with you, (O dear Prophet Mohammed \u2013 peace and blessings be upon him) say, \u201cI have submitted my face (self) to Allah and likewise have my followers\u201d; and say to the People given the Book(s) and the illiterate, \u201cHave you submitted (accepted Islam)?\u201d If they submit, they have attained the right path \u2013 and if they turn away (reject), then your duty is only to convey this command; and Allah is seeing the bondmen.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "So if they dispute with you say: \"I have submitted myself to Allah, and (so have) those who follow me.\" And say to those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and to those who are illiterate (Arab pagans): \"Do you (also) submit yourselves\" If they do, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the Message; and Allah sees the servants.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "But if they dispute with you, say: I have submitted myself entirely to Allah and (so) every one who follows me; and say to those who have been given the Book and the unlearned people: Do you submit yourselves? So if they submit then indeed they follow the right way; and if they turn back, then upon you is only the delivery of the message and Allah sees the servants.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "So if they dispute with thee, say: 'I have surrendered my will to God, and whosoever follows me. And say to those who have been given the Book and to the common folk: 'Have you surrendered?' If they have surrendered, they are right guided; but if they turn their backs, thine it is only to deliver the Message; and God sees His servants.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "And if they argue with thee, (O Muhammad), say: I have surrendered my purpose to Allah and (so have) those who follow me. And say unto those who have received the Scripture and those who read not: Have ye (too) surrendered? If they surrender, then truly they are rightly guided, and if they turn away, then it is thy duty only to convey the message (unto them). Allah is Seer of (His) bondmen.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "If they dispute with you, say, \"I have submitted my whole being to God and so have those who follow me.\" And ask those who have been given the Book, as well as the unlettered, \"Do you submit yourselves to God in the same way?\" If they submit themselves to Him, they are on the right path; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the message. God is observant of all His servants.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "Wherefore if they contend with thee, say thou: have surrendered myself unto Allah and he who followeth me. And say thou unto those who have been vouchsafed the Book and unto the illiterates; do you (also) accept Islam? Then if they accept Islam, they are of a surety guided; and if they turn away, then upon thee is only the preaching, and Allah is Beholder of His bondsmen.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "If they argue with you, say, \u2018I have submitted my will to Allah, and [so has] he who follows me.\u2019 And say to those who were given the Book and the uninstructed ones, \u2018Do you submit?\u2019 If they submit, they will certainly be guided; but if they turn away, then your duty is only to communicate, and Allah watches His servants.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "So if they dispute with thee, say: \"I have submitted My whole self to Allah and so have those who follow me.\" And say to the People of the Book and to those who are unlearned: \"Do ye (also) submit yourselves?\" If they do, they are in right guidance, but if they turn back, Thy duty is to convey the Message; and in Allah's sight are (all) His servants.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "So if they dispute with you (Muhammad SAW) say: \"I have submitted myself to Allah (in Islam), and (so have) those who follow me.\" And say to those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and to those who are illiterates (Arab pagans): \"Do you (also) submit yourselves (to Allah in Islam)?\" If they do, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the Message; and Allah is All-Seer of (His) slaves.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "If they argue with you, say: 'I have submitted my face to Allah and so have those who follow me' To those who have received the Book (Jews and Nazarenes) and to the ignorant, ask: 'Have you submitted yourselves to Allah' If they became Muslims they were guided, if they turn away, then your only duty is to warn them. Allah is watching over all His worshipers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "If they argue with you, say, \u201cI have surrendered myself to God, and those who follow me.\u201d And say to those who were given the Scripture, and to the unlearned, \u201cHave you surrendered?\u201d If they have surrendered, then they are guided; but if they turn away, then your duty is to convey. God is Seeing of the servants.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "So if they argue with you, say, \"I have submitted myself to Allah [in Islam], and [so have] those who follow me.\" And say to those who were given the Scripture and [to] the unlearned, \"Have you submitted yourselves?\" And if they submit [in Islam], they are rightly guided; but if they turn away - then upon you is only the [duty of] notification. And Allah is Seeing of [His] servants.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[3:20] So if they, the disbelievers, dispute with you, O Muhammad (s), concerning religion, say, to them: \u2018I have surrendered my countenance to God, [that is to say] I have submitted to Him, I, and whoever follows me\u2019 (wajh, \u2018countenance\u2019, is chosen here because of its noble character, for the other [parts of the body] will just as soon [surrender once the countenance has]); and say to those who have been given the Scripture, the Jews and the Christians, and to the uninstructed, the Arab idolaters: \u2018Have you submitted?\u2019, that is to say, \u2018Submit!\u2019 And so if they have submitted, they have been guided, from error, but if they turn their backs, to Islam, your duty is only to deliver, the Message; and God sees His servants, and so requites them for their deeds \u2014 this [statement] was [revealed] before the command to fight [them] had been revealed.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Allah then mentions their argument with the Prophet (pbuh) about the Religion of Islam, saying: (And if they) i.e. the Jews and Christians (argue with thee, Muhammad, say: I have surrendered my purpose) I make my Religion and works sincere (to Allah and (so have) those who follow me. And say unto those who have received the Scripture) the Jews and Christians (and those who read not) i.e. the Arabs: (Have ye (too) surrendered?) do you surrender as we have surrendered? Allah then said: (If they surrender) as you have surrendered, (then truly they are rightly guided) from error, (and if they turn away) from surrender, (then it is your duty only to convey the message (unto them)) on behalf of Allah. (Allah is Seer of (His) bondmen) those who believe and those who do not. 54\n"
