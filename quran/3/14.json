        "TRANSLATION_2": "Men are naturally tempted by the lure of women, children, treasures of gold and silver, horses of mark, cattle and plantations. These are the enjoyments in the life of this world; but with Allah lies a goodly abode to return to.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Worldly desires, wives, children, accumulated treasures of gold and silver, horses of noble breed, cattle, and farms are all made to seem attractive to men.

        "TRANSLATION_4": "Beautified is for mankind the love of these desires \u2013 women, and sons, and heaps of gold and piled up silver, and branded horses, and cattle and fields; this is the wealth of the life of this world; and it is Allah, with Whom is the excellent abode.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women, children, Qanatir Al-Muqantarah of gold and silver, branded beautiful horses (Musawwamah), cattle and fertile land. This is the pleasure of the present world's life; but Allah has the excellent return with Him.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "The love of desires, of women and sons and hoarded treasures of gold and silver and well bred horses and cattle and tilth, is made to seem fair to men; this is the provision of the life of this world; and Allah is He with Whom is the good goal (of life).\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "Decked out fair to men is the love of lusts -- women, children, heaped-up heaps of gold and silver, horses of mark, cattle and tillage. That is the enjoyment of the present life; but God -- with Him is the fairest resort.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_17": "[3:14] Beautified for mankind is love of lusts, that which the self lusts after and calls for, beautified by Satan, or by God as a test \u2014 of women, children, stored-up heaps of gold and silver, horses of mark, fine [horses], cattle, namely, camels, cows and sheep, and tillage, the cultivation of land. That, which is mentioned, is the comfort of the life of this world, enjoyed while it lasts, but then perishes; but God \u2014 with Him is the more excellent abode, place of return, which is Paradise, and for this reason one should desire none other than this [abode].\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Allah then mentions the bounties of the life of this world that He has made attractive for the unbelievers, saying: (Beautified for mankind is) what people's hearts find desirable is (love of the joys (that come) from women) meaning slave women and wives (and offspring) slaves and children, (and stored up heaps) amassed wealth (of gold and silver) it is also said that this means: minted or engraved gold and silver, (and horses branded (with their mark)) beautiful branded horses and grazing in pastures, (and cattle) i.e. sheep, cows and camels (and land) cultivation and cultivated lands. (That) which is mentioned above (is comfort of the life of the world) is of benefit to people in the life of this world and then it vanishes; it is also said that this means: the joys of this world last only for as long as the stuff of any home, a bowl, a plate and the like. (Allah! With Him is a more excellent abode) in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise, to whoever shun such joys.\n"
