Say, to them: \u2018Bring the Torah now, and recite it, so that the truth of what you say may become clear, if you are truthful\u2019, in what you say; they were stupified and did not bring it [the Torah]. God, exalted be He, then said:\n",

When this verse was revealed, the Prophet (pbuh) asked the Jews: \"What did Jacob forbid himself of food?\" They said: \"he did not forbid himself any type of food, and whatever is forbidden for us today, such as the meat of camels and other things, was already forbidden on all prophets, from Adam to Moses (pbut). It is only you who make such things lawful\". And they claimed those things were also forbidden in the Torah. Hence Allah said to Muhammad (pbuh): (Say) to them: (Produce the Torah and read it (unto us)) where they are made forbidden (if ye are truthful) in your claim. But they failed to produce the Torah and knew they were liars since there was nothing in the Torah to substantiate their claim.\n"
