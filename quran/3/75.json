But there are others among them who, if you entrust them with just a single dinar, will not return it to you, unless you stay standing over them. That is because they say, 'We are under no obligation where the gentiles are concerned.' They tell a lie against Allah and they know it.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "There are some among the people of the Book who return a whole treasure entrusted to them; yet some there are who do not give back a dinar until you demand and insist, because they say: \"It is not a sin for us to (usurp) the rights of the Arabs.\" Yet they lie against God, and they know it.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "And among the People of the Book there are some who would restore you even if you were to entrust a treasure of gold, and of them there are some whom were you to entrust with one gold piece, will not restore it unless you stand over them. That is because they say: 'We will not be taken to task for whatever we may do to non-Jews (ummls). Thus they falsely fix a lie upon Allah, and do so wittingly.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "If you entrust some of the People of the Book, with a large quantity of gold, they will return it to you while if you entrust others among them with a small quantity of gold, they will not give it back to you unless you keep insisting on its return. For they say, \"We are not bound to keep our words with the illiterate people,\" and they themselves knowingly ascribe false statements to God.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Among the People given the Book(s) is one who, if you trust him with a heap of treasure, will return it to you; and among them is one who, if you trust him with (just) one coin, will not return it to you unless you constantly stand over him (keep demanding); that is because they say, \u201cWe are not obliged in any way, in the case of illiterates\u201d; and they purposely fabricate lies against Allah.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Among the People of the Scripture is he who, if entrusted with a Qintar (a great amount of wealth), will readily pay it back; and among them there is he who, if entrusted with a single silver coin, will not repay it unless you constantly stand demanding, because they say: \"There is no blame on us to betray and take the properties of the illiterates (Arabs).\" But they tell a lie against Allah while they know it.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "And among the followers of the Book there are some such that if you entrust one (of them) with a heap of wealth, he shall pay it back to you; and among them there are some such that if you entrust one (of them) with a dinar he shall not pay it back to you except so long as you remain firm in demanding it; this is because they say: There is not upon us in the matter of the unlearned people any way (to reproach); and they tell a lie against Allah while they know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "And of the People of the Book is he who, if thou trust him with a hundredweight, will restore it thee; and of them is he who, if thou trust him with one pound, will not restore it thee, unless ever thou standest over him. That, because they say, 'There is no way over us as to the common people.' They speak falsehood against God and that wittingly.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Among the People of the Scripture there is he who, if thou trust him with a weight of treasure, will return it to thee. And among them there is he who, if thou trust him with a piece of gold, will not return it to thee unless thou keep standing over him. That is because they say: We have no duty to the Gentiles. They speak a lie concerning Allah knowingly.\n",

But there are others of them who, if you entrust them with a single dinar, will not return it to you, unless you keep demanding it from them. That is because they say, \"We are under no obligation towards the gentiles.\" They deliberately tell lies about God.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "And of the people of the Book is he whom if thou trustest with a talent, he will restore it unto thee, and among them is he whom if thou trustest with a dinar, he will not restore it unto thee except thou art ever standing over him that is because they say there is in the matter of the illiterates no call on us. And they forge a lie against Allah while they know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "Among the People of the Book is he who if you entrust him with a quintal will repay it to you, and among them is he who, if you entrust him with a dinar will not repay it to you unless you stand persistently over him. That is because they say, \u2018We have no obligation to the non-Jews.\u2019 But they attribute lies to Allah, and they know [it].\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "Among the People of the Book are some who, if entrusted with a hoard of gold, will (readily) pay it back; others, who, if entrusted with a single silver coin, will not repay it unless thou constantly stoodest demanding, because, they say, \"there is no call on us (to keep faith) with these ignorant (Pagans).\" but they tell a lie against Allah, and (well) they know it.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "Among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is he who, if entrusted with a Cantar (a great amount of wealth, etc.), will readily pay it back; and among them there is he who, if entrusted with a single silver coin, will not repay it unless you constantly stand demanding, because they say: \"There is no blame on us to betray and take the properties of the illiterates (Arabs).\" But they tell a lie against Allah while they know it.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "Among the People of the Book there are some, who, if you trust him with a Qintar (98, 841. 6 lbs.), will return it to you, and there are others, who, if you trust him with a dinar will not hand it back unless you stand over him, for they say: 'As for the common people, they have no recourse to us' They say lies against Allah while they know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "Among the People of the Book is he, who, if you entrust him with a heap of gold, he will give it back to you. And among them is he, who, if you entrust him with a single coin, he will not give it back to you, unless you keep after him. That is because they say, \u201cWe are under no obligation towards the gentiles.\u201d They tell lies about God, and they know it.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "And among the People of the Scripture is he who, if you entrust him with a great amount [of wealth], he will return it to you. And among them is he who, if you entrust him with a [single] silver coin, he will not return it to you unless you are constantly standing over him [demanding it]. That is because they say, \"There is no blame upon us concerning the unlearned.\" And they speak untruth about Allah while they know [it].\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[3:75] And of the People of the Scripture is he who, if you trust him with a hundredweight, that is, with much money, he will return it to you, on account of his trustworthiness, the like of \u2018Abd All\u0101h b. Sal\u0101m to whom a man entrusted 1200 plates of gold, which he then returned to him; and of them is he who, if you trust him with one dinar, will not return it to you, on account of his treachery; unless you keep standing over him, not leaving him for one minute, for as soon as you leave him, he will deny it, as was the case with Ka\u2018b b. alAshraf, to whom a man from Quraysh entrusted a dinar and later denied it. That, refusal to return things, is because they say, \u2018We have no duty towards, namely, [no possibility of acquiring] sin because of, the Gentiles\u2019, the Arabs; for they considered it lawful to be unjust towards any person of a different religion, and they attributed [the source of] this conviction to God, exalted be He. God, exalted be He, says, They speak falsehood against God, by attributing such things to Him, while they are aware, that they are liars.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Subsequently, Allah mentions the trustworthiness and treachery of the people of the Book, saying: (Among the People of the Scripture) i.e. the Jews (there is he who, if you trust him with a weight of treasure, will return it to you) without any problem, hardship or ever thinking to keep it for himself by declaring it lawful for him to take. The reference here is to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions. (And among them there is he who, if you trust him with a piece of gold, will not return it to you) and will declare it lawful for him to take (unless you keep standing over him) insisting on taking it back and suing him for it. The reference here is to Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf and his followers. (That) treachery and declaring that it is lawful to take other people's property (is because they say: We have no duty to the Gentiles) there is no harm in taking the property of Arabs. (They speak a lie concerning Allah knowingly) they lie about Allah and know that they are lying. 62\n"
