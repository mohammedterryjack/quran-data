The purpose of their supplication in this way is to show that their concern is with the matter of the Hereafter, and for this reason they ask [God] for adherence to the path of guidance, in order to attain its reward. The two Shaykhs [Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim] reported that \u2018\u0100\u2019isha, may God be pleased with her, said, \u2018The Messenger of God (s) recited this verse: It is He Who revealed to you the Book, wherein are verses clear [to the end of] the verse, and said, \u201cWhen you see those pursuing the allegorical parts, [know that] these are the ones God refers to [in this verse], so beware of them\u201d \u2019. Al-Tabar\u0101n\u012b reported in his al-Kab\u012br that Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 al-Ash\u2018ar\u012b heard the Prophet (s) say, \u2018I fear nothing for my community except three faults\u2019, and he mentioned that one of these would be when the Book is opened in front of them, and the believer will desire to interpret it, and yet none knows its interpretation, save God; and those firmly rooted in knowledge say, \u2018We believe in it, all is from our Lord; yet none remembers but people of pith\u2019 [Q. 3:7] [end of the] had\u012bth.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Our Lord!) they say: our Lord! (it is Thou Who gatherest mankind together) after they die (to a Day) on a day (of which there is no doubt. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep the tryst) resurrection after death, the reckoning, the Bridge over hell, the Scale, Paradise and hell. 52\n"
