        "TRANSLATION_0": "You will be tested in your wealth and in yourselves and you will hear many abusive words from those given the Book before you and from those who are idolaters. But if you are steadfast and have taqwa, that is the most resolute course to take.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "You will, nonetheless, be tried with your wealth and life, and will hear many untoward things from the followers of former Books and the infidels. But if you endure with patience and follow the straight path, it will surely (accord) with God's fixed resolve about human affairs.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "(Believers!) You will certainly be put to test in respect of your properties and lives, and you will certainly hear many hurtful things from those who were granted the Book before you and those who have associated others with Allah in His divinity. If you remain patient and God-fearing this indeed is a matter of great resolution.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "You (believers) will certainly be tested by the loss of your property and lives and you will hear a great many grieving words from the People of the Book and the pagans. If you will have patience and piety, it will be a sign of firm determination and steadfastness (in life).\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "You will surely be tried in respect of your property and lives, and you will surely hear much wrong from those who were given the Book before you, and from the polytheists; and if you remain steadfast and remain pious, it is then an act of great courage.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "You shall certainly be tried and tested in your wealth and properties and in yourselves, and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) and from those who ascribe partners to Allah; but if you persevere patiently, and have Taqwa, then verily, that will be a determining factor in all affairs.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "You shall certainly be tried respecting your wealth and your souls, and you shall certainly hear from those who have been given the Book before you and from those who are polytheists much annoying talk; and if you are patient and guard (against evil), surely this is one of the affairs (which should be) determined upon.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "You shall surely be tried in your possessions and your selves, and you shall hear from those who were given the Book before you, and from those who are idolaters, much hurt; but if you are patient and godfearing -- surely that is true constancy.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Assuredly ye will be tried in your property and in your persons, and ye will hear much wrong from those who were given the Scripture before you, and from the idolaters. But if ye persevere and ward off (evil), then that is of the steadfast heart of things.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "You will surely be tried and tested in your possessions and your persons, and you shall surely hear many hurtful things from those who were given the Book before you and from those who set up partners with God, but if you endure with fortitude and restrain yourselves, that indeed is a matter of strong determination.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "O Ye shall surely be proven in your riches and in your lives; and will surely bear much hurt from those who were vouchsafed the Book before you and from those who associate gods, and if ye endure and fear, then verily that is of the commandments determined.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "You will surely be tested in your possessions and your souls, and you will surely hear much affront from those who were given the Book before you and from the polytheists; but if you are patient and Godwary, that is indeed the steadiest of courses.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves; and ye shall certainly Hear much that will grieve you, from those who received the Book before you and from those who worship many gods. But if ye persevere patiently, and guard against evil,-then that will be a determining factor in all affairs.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "You shall certainly be tried and tested in your wealth and properties and in your personal selves, and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) and from those who ascribe partners to Allah, but if you persevere patiently, and become Al-Muttaqun (the pious - see V. 2:2) then verily, that will be a determining factor in all affairs, and that is from the great matters, [which you must hold on with all your efforts].\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "You shall be tried in your wealth and yourselves, and you shall hear much hurt from those who were given the Book before you, and from those who are idolaters. But if you are patient and cautious, surely, that is of the firm affairs.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "You will be tested through your possessions and your persons; and you will hear from those who received the Scripture before you, and from the idol worshipers, much abuse. But if you persevere and lead a righteous life\u2014that indeed is a mark of great determination.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "You will surely be tested in your possessions and in yourselves. And you will surely hear from those who were given the Scripture before you and from those who associate others with Allah much abuse. But if you are patient and fear Allah - indeed, that is of the matters [worthy] of determination.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[3:186] You shall surely be tried (la-tublawunna, the [final] n\u016bn nominative indicator has been omitted because two n\u016bn letters [would otherwise] succeed one another, as has been the plural person indicator w\u0101w where two unvocalised consonants have come together), in other words, you shall surely be tested, in your property, through the duties [imposed] thereupon and through the damages that affect them; and in your selves, through [the obligations of] worship and through calamities, and you shall hear from those who were given the Scripture before you, the Jews and the Christians, and from those who are idolaters, from among the Arabs, much hurt, in the way of insult, slander and [their] flirting with your women; but if you are patient, through this, and fear, God \u2014 surely that is true resolve, that is, it is one of those things regarding which one must necessarily have firm resolve.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Allah then mentioned the harm that the unbelievers inflicted on the Prophet and his Companions, saying: (Assuredly ye will be tried) you will be tested (in your property) by the loss of your property (and in your persons) and in what befalls your persons of sicknesses, pain, killings, beatings and general misfortunes, (and ye will hear much wrong from those who were given the Scripture before you) i.e. the Jews and Christians: you will hear vilification, defamation, lies and false testimony against Allah, (and from the idolaters) i.e. the Arab idolaters. (But if ye persevere) in the face of their harm (and ward off (evil)) and ward off transgressing against Allah while facing such harm, (then that) steadfastness and endurance (is of the steadfast heart of things) is the best of things and the most firm for believers.\n"
