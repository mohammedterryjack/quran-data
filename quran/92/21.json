The verse applies [equally] to anyone who may do as he [Ab\u016b Bakr] did, may God be pleased with him, and such [a person] will thereby be removed far from the Fire and rewarded. When this was revealed, the Prophet (s) said All\u0101hu akbar! at the end, and so it became the recommended practice (sunna) to say this at the end of it; it is also reported that it [the saying of it] is actually enjoined at the end of this [s\u016bra] and at the end of every s\u016bra henceforth, and that is [to say] All\u0101hu akbar or l\u0101 il\u0101ha ill\u0101\u2019Ll\u0101h wa\u2019Ll\u0101hu akbar.\n",
