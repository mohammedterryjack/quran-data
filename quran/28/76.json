        "TRANSLATION_1": "Verily Qarun was of Moses' people, but he began to oppress them. We had given him treasures, so many that a team of wrestlers could hardly lift their keys. His people said to him: \"Do not be exultant. God does not like those who exult.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "To be sure, Qarun (Korah) was one of Moses' people; then he transgressed against them. We had bestowed on him such treasure that their very keys would have been raised with difficulty by a whole group of strong people. Once when his people said to him: \"Do not exult, for Allah does not love those who exult (in their riches).\n",

We had given him so much treasure that the keys of the stores of his treasures could hardly even be carried by a group of strong people.

        "TRANSLATION_6": "Surely Qaroun was of the people of Musa, but he rebelled against them, and We had given him of the treasures, so much so that his hoards of wealth would certainly weigh down a company of men possessed of great strength.

        "TRANSLATION_8": "Now Korah was of Moses' folk, but he oppressed them; and We gave him so much treasure that the stores thereof would verily have been a burden for a troop of mighty men. When his own folk said unto him: Exult not; lo! Allah loveth not the exultant;\n",

For We had given him so many treasures that [the number of] their keys would verily have burdened a group of strong men, in other words, they would have been too heavy for such [men] (the b\u0101\u2019 of [bi\u2019l-\u2018usbati, \u2018a group\u2019] is to render transitive [the intransitive] verb); the number of such [men required] is estimated to be 70, 40 or 10; other estimates are also given. Mention, when his people, the believers among the Children of Israel, said to him, \u2018Do not be exultant, in [your] great wealth, an exultation of insolence; truly God does not love the exultant, in such [things];\n",

He said: \"Moses has been given messengership and Aaron religious authority while have nothing; this I will not accept\", and he rejected Moses' prophethood (and We gave him so much treasure) wealth (that the stores thereof) the keys of his stores (would verily have been a burden for a troop of mighty men) 40 men carried the keys of his stores. (When his own folk) the folk of Moses (said unto him: Exult not) do not be too proud nor associate partners with Allah; (lo! Allah loveth not the exultant) Allah does not love those who are too proud because of their wealth;\n"
