She walked in front of him but when the wind began to blow off her dress and reveal her legs, he said to her, \u2018Walk behind me and show me the way\u2019, which she did. Finally he came to her father, Shu\u2018ayb, peace be upon him, who was sitting with some supper in front of him. He said to him, \u2018Sit and have some supper\u2019. He [Moses] said, \u2018I hope that this is not [some sort of] compensation for having watered [their flock] for them? For we are People of a House and do not demand compensation for good deeds\u2019. He [Shu\u2018ayb] said, \u2018No. It is [simply] a custom of mine and of my forefathers to be hospitable to guests and to offer them food\u2019. Thus, he [Moses] ate and informed him of his predicament. God, exalted be He, says: So when he came to him and recounted to him the story (al-qasas is a verbal noun with the sense of al-maqs\u016bs, \u2018that which is recounted\u2019), of his slaying of the Egyptian and their intention to slay him and his fear of Pharaoh, he [their father] said, \u2018Do not be afraid.

Then, when he came unto him) when Moses went to Yathron, the nephew of the Prophet Shu'ayb who had died before (and told him) told Yathron (the (whole) story) of his escape from Pharaoh and the rest of it, (he said) Yathron said to him: (Fear not! thou hast escaped from the wrong-doing folk) the people of Egypt.\n"
