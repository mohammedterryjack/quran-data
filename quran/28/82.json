Had God not been gracious to us, He would have made us to be swallowed too\u2019 (read active la-khasafa, or passive la-khusifa).

(If Allah had not been gracious unto us) and withheld from us what He gave him, (He would have caused it to swallow us (also)) as it swallowed Korah. (Ah, welladay! the disbelievers never prosper) they will never be safe from Allah's torment.\n"
