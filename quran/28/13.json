He [Moses] remained with her until he was weaned during which time she was paid wages at one dinar per day. She took this because it was money from enemy territory (harb\u012b). She then brought him [back] to Pharaoh in whose household he was raised, as God recounts of him in s\u016brat al-Shu\u2018ar\u0101\u2019 [Q. 26:18], Did we not rear you among us as a child, and did you not stay with us for years of your life?\n",
