It happened that Ab\u016b Sufy\u0101n was returning from Syria with a caravan. The Prophet (s) and his followers went forth to plunder it; but Quraysh became aware of this, and so Ab\u016b Jahl and some Meccan fighters rode out to defend it \u2014 these constituted the \u2018band\u2019. Ab\u016b Sufy\u0101n drove the caravan via the coastal route and it managed to escape. Ab\u016b Jahl was then advised to return, but he refused and marched on towards Badr. The Prophet (s) consulted with his followers, saying to them, \u2018God has promised me one of the two parties\u2019. So they agreed with him to attack the [Meccan] band, but some of them were averse to this, complaining, \u2018We have not come prepared for this!\u2019, as God, exalted be He, says:\n",
