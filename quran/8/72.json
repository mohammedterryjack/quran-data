But if they ask you for help in respect of the deen, it is your duty to help them, except against people you have a treaty with. Allah sees what you do.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Those who accepted the faith and set out of their homes, and fought in the way of God wealth and soul, and those who gave them shelter and helped them, are friends of one another. You are not responsible for protecting those who embraced the faith but did not leave their homes, until they do so. In ease they ask for your help in the name of faith, you are duty bound to help them, except against a people with whom you have a treaty; for God sees all that you do.\n",

And those who believed but did not emigrate \u2014 you have no duty to make an alliance (read wil\u0101ya or wal\u0101ya) with them, and so there is no inheriting between you and them and no share of the spoils for them, until they emigrate, this was abrogated by the end of this s\u016bra; but if they ask you for assistance in the matter of religion then it is your duty to assist, them against the disbelievers, except against a folk between whom and you there is a covenant, a pact: in which case, do not assist them against these others and so break your pact; and God sees what you do.\n",
