(And if ye cease) from disbelief and fighting (it will be better for you) than disbelief and fighting, (but if ye return) to fighting Muhammad (pbuh) (We also shall return) to your killing and defeat as on the Day of Badr. (And your host) your group (will avail you naught) vis-a-vis Allah's punishment, (however numerous it be, and (know) that Allah is with the believers) He assists them by giving them victory.\n"
