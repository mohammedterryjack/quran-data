Truly God is Knower of all things, including the wisdom regarding [the rules of] inheritance. Medinese [entirely], or [Medinese] except for the last two verses ending with verse 130 [which are Meccan], or [Medinese] except for one verse. The basmala, \u2018In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful\u2019, does not preface this [s\u016bra] because the Prophet (s) was not commanded to [recite] it [in this way], as may be understood from a had\u012bth reported by al-H\u0101kim, in which he states [by way of an isn\u0101d] from \u2018Al\u012b that the basmala is [invoked] for \u2018security\u2019 (am\u0101n), whereas this [s\u016bra] was revealed to remove security by way of the sword. According to [a had\u012bth related] by Hudhayfa [b. al-Yam\u0101n]: \u2018You call it the s\u016bra of Repentance, but it is actually the s\u016bra of Chastisement (al-\u2018adh\u0101b)\u2019. Al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b reported [by way of an isn\u0101d] from al-Bar\u0101\u2019 [b. \u2018\u0100zib] that this was the last s\u016bra to be revealed.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And those who afterwards) after the first Emigrants (believed) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and left their homes) and migrated from Mecca to Medina (and strove along with you) against the enemy, (they are of you) they are with you in secret and openly; (and those who are akin) those who are related by their lineage, the closer then the one who comes next, etc., (are nearer one to another) in relation to the division of estates (in the ordinance of Allah) in the Guarded Tablet. With this verse, the first verse was abrogated. (Lo! Allah is Knower) He knows the idolaters' breaking of their treaties (of all things) the division of estates, 192 what is good for you as well as other things. And Allah knows best the inner meanings of His Scripture'. And of the surah in which repentance is mentioned, which is Medinan in its entirety-except, it is said, the last two verses which are Meccan-and consists of 129 verses, 2,467 words and 10,000 letters: Surah 9: Repentance (al-Tawbah) And of the surah in which repentance is mentioned, which is Medinan in its entirety \u2014 except, it is said, the last two verses which are Meccan \u2014 and consists of 129 verses, 2,467 words and 10,000 letters:\n"
