The ship was 300 cubits (the measure of his arm) long, 50 cubits wide, and its height 30 cubits. It had three decks, some of which were lower than others. In the lower deck, he put beasts of prey and reptiles; in the intermediate deck wild animals and beasts; and in the higher deck people who were 80 in number: 40 men and 40 women. The men and the women were separated by the body of Adam (pbuh). Noah had three of his sons with him: Shem, Ham and Yapheth\".\n"
