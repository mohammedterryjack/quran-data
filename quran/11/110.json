        "TRANSLATION_2": "And We certainly gave Moses the Book before, and there arose disagreements about it (even as there are disagreements now about the Book revealed to you). Had it not been for a decree that had already gone forth from your Lord, the matter would have long been decided between them. Indeed they are in a disquieting doubt about it.\n",
