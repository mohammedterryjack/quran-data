        "TRANSLATION_0": "But as for those who have clear evidence from their Lord followed up by a witness from Him - and before it the Book of Musa came as a model and a mercy - such people have iman in it. Any faction which rejects it is promised the Fire. Be in no doubt about it. It is the Truth from your Lord. But most people have no iman.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Will he who has a clear proof from his Lord, which acts as evidence from Him, before which the Book of Moses was a way-giver and a grace, (not believe in it)? Whoever among the partisans does not believe in it shall have Hell as the promised award. So have no doubt about it, for surely it's the truth from your Lord, though most men may not believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Can it happen that he who takes his stand on a clear evidence from his Lord, subsequently followed by a witness from Him (in his support), and prior to that the Book of Moses was revealed as a guide and a mercy, (would even he deny the truth in the manner of those who adore the life of this world)? Rather, such men are bound to believe in it. The Fire shall be the promised resort of the groups that disbelieve. So be in no doubt about it for this indeed is the truth from your Lord although most people do not believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Should they be compared with those whose Lord has given them a guidance which is testified by a witness from among their own people and by the Book of Moses, a guide and a mercy. Such people do believe in this guidance (in the Quran). Those who disbelieve (in the Quran) will have hell as their dwelling place. Thus, (Muhammad), have no doubt about it (the Quran). It is certainly the truth from your Lord, yet many people do not have faith.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "So is the one who is upon the clear proof* from his Lord, and comes a witness upon it from Allah, and before it the Book of Moosa, a leader and a mercy; they accept faith in it; and whoever denies it from all the groups, then the fire is promised for him; so O listener, do not have any doubt concerning it; indeed it is the truth from your Lord; but most people do not believe. (* The Jews who accepted faith in the Qur\u2019an.)\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Can they who rely on a clear proof from their Lord, and whom a witness from Him recites (follows) it; and before it, came the Book of Musa, a guidance and a mercy, they believe therein, but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place. So be not in doubt about it. Verily, it is the truth from your Lord, but most of mankind believe not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "Is he then who has with him clear proof from his Lord, and a witness from Him recites it and before it (is) the Book of Musa, a guide and a mercy? These believe in it; and whoever of the (different) parties disbelieves in it, surely it is the truth from your Lord, but most men do not believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "And what of him who stands upon a clear sign from his Lord, and a witness from Him recites it, and before him is the Book of Moses for an ensample and a mercy? Those believe in it; but whosoever disbelieves in it, being one of the partisans, his promised land is the Fire. So be thou not in doubt of it; it is the truth from thy Lord, but most men do not believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Is he (to be counted equal with them) who relieth on a clear proof from his Lord, and a witness from Him reciteth it, and before it was the Book of Moses, an example and a mercy? Such believe therein, and whoso disbelieveth therein of the clans, the Fire is his appointed place. So be not thou in doubt concerning it. Lo! it is the Truth from thy Lord; but most of mankind believe not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "Can they be compared to those who possess a clear proof from their Lord, followed up by a witness from Him, preceded by the Book of Moses, as a guide and a mercy? These people believe in it; whereas those groups that deny its truth are promised the Fire. Therefore, have no doubt about it. It is the truth from your Lord, but most people do not believe it.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "Is he like unto him who resteth upon an evidence from His Lord, so and there rehearseth it a witness from Him And before it was the Book of Musa, a pattern and a mercy; these believe therein; and whosoever of the sects disbelieveth therein, the Fire is his promised place. Be then thou not in dubitation thereof, verily it is the truth from thy Lord, yet most of the mankind believe not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "Is he who stands on a manifest proof from his Lord, and whom a witness of his own [family] follows? And before him there was the Book of Moses, a guide and mercy. It is they who have faith in it, and whoever defies him from among the factions, the Fire is their tryst. So do not be in doubt about it; it is the truth from your Lord, but most people do not have faith.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "Can they be (like) those who accept a Clear (Sign) from their Lord, and whom a witness from Himself doth teach, as did the Book of Moses before it,- a guide and a mercy? They believe therein; but those of the Sects that reject it,- the Fire will be their promised meeting-place. Be not then in doubt thereon: for it is the truth from thy Lord: yet many among men do not believe!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "Can they (Muslims) who rely on a clear proof (the Quran) from their Lord, and whom a witness [Prophet Muhammad SAW through Jibrael (Gabriel)] from Him follows it (can they be equal with the disbelievers); and before it, came the Book of Musa (Moses), a guidance and a mercy, they believe therein, but those of the sects (Jews, Christians and all the other non-Muslim nations) that reject it (the Quran), the Fire will be their promised meeting-place. So be not in doubt about it (i.e. those who denied Prophet Muhammad SAW and also denied all that which he brought from Allah, surely, they will enter Hell). Verily, it is the truth from your Lord, but most of the mankind believe not.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "Then what of he who stands upon a clear proof from his Lord, recited by a witness from Him and before him is the Book of Moses for a guide and a mercy? Those believe in it. But as for those partisans who disbelieve in it, their promised land shall be the Fire. Therefore do not doubt it. It is the truth from your Lord, yet most people do not believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "Is he who possesses a clear proof from his Lord, recited by a witness from Him, and before it the Book of Moses, a guide and a mercy? These believe in it. But whoever defies it from among the various factions, the Fire is his promise. So have no doubt about it. It is the truth from your Lord, but most people do not believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "So is one who [stands] upon a clear evidence from his Lord [like the aforementioned]? And a witness from Him follows it, and before it was the Scripture of Moses to lead and as mercy. Those [believers in the former revelations] believe in the Qur'an. But whoever disbelieves in it from the [various] factions - the Fire is his promised destination. So be not in doubt about it. Indeed, it is the truth from your Lord, but most of the people do not believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[11:17] Is he who relies on a clear proof, a clear statement, from his Lord, meaning the Prophet (s), or the believers; it [the proof] being the Qur\u2019\u0101n, [a clear proof] which is followed by a witness, to it of its veracity [as being], from Him, that is, from God; he [the witness] being Gabriel, and before it, [before] the Qur\u2019\u0101n, was the Book of Moses, the Torah, also a witness to it, as an example and a mercy? (im\u0101man wa-rahmatan is a circumstantial qualifier) [is such a person] like one who is not so? No! Those, that is, the ones who rely on a clear proof, they believe in it, that is, in the Qur\u2019\u0101n, and so for them will be Paradise; but he who disbelieves in it of the partisans, [namely] all the disbelievers, the Fire shall be his appointed place. So do not be in doubt, in uncertainty, concerning it, concerning the Qur\u2019\u0101n. Truly it is the Truth from your Lord, but most of mankind, that is, the people of Mecca, do not believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Is he (to be counted equal with them) who relieth on a clear proof from his Lord) is he who relies on a clear exposition, i.e. the Qur'an, from his Lord, (and a witness from Him) a witness from Allah, i.e. the angel Gabriel (reciteth it) recites to him the Qur'an, (and before it) before the Qur'an (was the Book of Moses) the Torah of Moses which Gabriel recited to him, (an example) to be emulated (and a mercy) to anyone who believes in it? (such) those who believe in the Book of Moses (believe therein) believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an; the reference here is to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers, (and Whoso disbelieveth therein) whoever disbelieves in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (of the clans) of all the disbelievers, (the Fire is his appointed place) the Fire is his destination. (So be not thou) Muhammad (in doubt concerning it) concerning the end result of the disbelievers. (Lo! it is the Truth from thy Lord) the destination of whosoever disbelieves in the Qur'an is hell; it is also said that this means: do not be in doubt about the Qur'an, it is Gabriel who brought it down; (but most of mankind) the people of Mecca (believe not).\n"
