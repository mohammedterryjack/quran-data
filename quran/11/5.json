It is also said: [that it was revealed] regarding the hypocrites: Lo!, they fold up their breasts that they may hide from Him, that is, [from] God; lo! the moment they cover themselves with their garments, wrapping themselves up therewith, He, God, exalted be He, knows what they keep hidden and what they proclaim, and so their hiding is to no avail. Truly He knows what is in the breasts [of men], that is, what is in the hearts.\n",

(At the very moment when they cover themselves with their clothing) at the moment they cover their heads with their clothes, (Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden) among themselves as well as that which they conceal in their hearts (and that which they proclaim) of fighting and antipathy; it is also said that this refers to that which they proclaim of love and keeping company. (Lo! He is Aware of what is in the breasts (of men)) whether it is good or evil.\n"
