        "TRANSLATION_0": "Here you are then: people who are called upon to spend in the Way of Allah and then some of you are tight-fisted! But whoever is tight-fisted is only tight-fisted to himself. Allah is Rich and you are poor. If you turn away, He will replace you with a people other than yourselves and they will not be like you.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Beware! You are called to spend in the way of God, yet some among you close their fists. But he who is niggardly is so for his own self: God is above need, and it is you who are needy. If you turn away then God will bring other people in your place who, moreover, will not be like you.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Behold, you are those who are called upon to spend in Allah's Way, but some of you are niggardly. Whoever is niggardly is in fact niggardly to himself. For Allah is All-Sufficient, whereas it is you who are in need of Him. If you turn away, He will replace you by a people other than you, and they will not be like you.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "It is you who are asked to spend for the cause of God, but some of you behave in a niggardly way. Whoever behaves miserly does so against his own soul. God is Self-sufficient and you are poor. If you were to turn away from Him, He would just replace you with another people, who will not be like you.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Yes, undoubtedly it is you who are being called, that you may spend in Allah\u2019s way; so some among you act miserly; and whoever is miserly, is being a miser upon himself; and Allah is the Independent (Wealthy \u2013 Not requiring anything), whereas you all are needy; and if you renege, He will replace you with other people \u2013 and they will not be like you.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Here you are now invited to spend in Allah's cause; but among you are those who withhold (stingily). And whoever acts stingily is but stingy toward himself. For Allah is indeed free of needs, while you are the needy. And if you turn away, He will replace you with other people; then they will not be like you.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "Behold! you are those who are called upon to spend in Allah's way, but among you are those who are niggardly, and whoever is niggardly is niggardly against his own soul; and Allah is Self-sufficient and you have need (of Him), and if you turn back He will bring in your place another people, then they will not be like you.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "Ha, there you are; you are called upon to expend in God's way, and some of you are niggardly. Whoso is niggardly is niggardly only to his own soul.

        "TRANSLATION_12": "Behold, ye are those invited to spend (of your substance) in the Way of Allah: But among you are some that are niggardly. But any who are niggardly are so at the expense of their own souls. But Allah is free of all wants, and it is ye that are needy. If ye turn back (from the Path), He will substitute in your stead another people; then they would not be like you!\n",

And whoever is niggardly, it is only at the expense of his ownself. But Allah is Rich (Free of all wants), and you (mankind) are poor. And if you turn away (from Islam and the obedience of Allah), He will exchange you for some other people, and they will not be your likes.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "There you are! You are called upon to spend in the Way of Allah. Some of you are mean; yet whoever is mean is mean only to his own soul. Allah is theRich and you are the poor. If you turn away, He will replace you with another nation, and they will not be like you.\n",

God is the Rich, while you are the needy. And if you turn away, He will replace you with another people, and they will not be like you.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "Here you are - those invited to spend in the cause of Allah - but among you are those who withhold [out of greed]. And whoever withholds only withholds [benefit] from himself; and Allah is the Free of need, while you are the needy. And if you turn away, He will replace you with another people; then they will not be the likes of you.\n",

For God is the Independent One, [without need] of your expending; while you are the needy, of Him. And if you turn away, from obedience to Him, He will replace you with another people, that is to say, He will bring them in your place, and they will not be the likes of you, in turning away from obedience to Him, but [they will be] obedient to Him, Mighty and Majestic [is He]. Medinese: it was revealed on the return from al-Hudaybiyya; it consists of 29 verses.\n",

(And as for him who hoardeth) and refrains from spending in obedience of Allah, (he hoardeth only from his soul) he is miserly only insofar as reward for, and honour of, his soul are concerned. (And Allah is the Rich) He has no need for your wealth and charity, (and ye are the poor) for Allah's mercy, Paradise and forgiveness. (And if ye turn away) from obeying Allah and obeying His Messenger regarding that which He commands you of spending (He will exchange you for some other folk) He will make you perish and replace you with others who are better and more obedient than you, (and they will not be the likes of you) in relation to transgression and disobedience; rather, they will be better and more obedient than you. It is also said that from Allah's saying (0 ye who believe) to the end were revealed about the hypocrites of Asad and Ghatafan, and so Allah replaced them with Juhaynah and Muzaynah who were better and more obedient to Allah'. And of the surah in which Victory is mentioned, which is all Medinan, and consists of 29 verses, 560 words and 2,400 letters: Surah 48: Victory (al-Fath) And of the surah in which Victory is mentioned, which is all Medinan, and consists of 29 verses, 560 words and 2,400 letters: 595\n"
