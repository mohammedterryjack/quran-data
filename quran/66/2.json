Sulaym\u0101n] said, \u2018He set free a slave [in expiation] for his prohibition of M\u0101riya\u2019; whereas al-Hasan [al-Basr\u012b] said, \u2018He never expiated, because the Prophet (s) has been forgiven [all errors]\u2019. And God is your Protector, your Helper, and He is the Knower, the Wise.\n",
