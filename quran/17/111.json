And magnify Him with magnifications [worthy of Him], extol Him with a perfect extolling above that He should have taken a son or a partner, and [above] any weakness and [above] all that does not befit Him. The arrangement whereby \u2018praise\u2019 is [invoked] together with this [statement] is meant to indicate that He is the One worthy of all praise, because of the   perfection of His Essence and the fact that He alones possesses those attributes of His. Imam Ahmad [b. Hanbal] relates in his Musnad [by way of a report] from Mu\u2018\u0101dh al-Juhan\u012b [who heard it] from the Messenger of God (s), who used to say, \u2018The \u201cglory\u201d verse [in the Qur\u2019\u0101n] is: Praise be to God, Who has neither taken a son, nor has He any partner in sovereignty \u2026 to the end [of the above-mentioned s\u016bra, 17:111]\u2019, and God, exalted be He, knows best. The author of this [commentary] says, \u2018This [last commentary] constitutes the end of my complement to the commentary on the Noble Qur\u2019\u0101n composed by the inquisitive scholar, the shaykh, Imam Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn alMahall\u012b al-Sh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b, may God be pleased with him. I have expended every effort in it and reflected throughout it exhaustively, [especially] in those precious things that I have deemed, God willing, to be profitable. I composed it [this commentary] in the same length of time appointed for the one spoken to by God [sc. Moses] and I have made it a means to attaining the Gardens of Bliss. It [this commentary] actually draws on the work which it complements, relying and depending on it for [an understanding of] those allegorical verses. May God have mercy on one who examines it with impartiality, chances upon an error and informs me of it. As I have said: \u201cI praise God, my Lord, for He guided me in what I have expressed despite my incapacity and weakness; for who [other than God] is there to avert me from error and who is there to accept from me even a single letter\u201d. In fact, it never occurred to me to embark upon such [a task], knowing that I was incapable of delving into such issues. Perhaps God will make it of ample profit [to others] and through it open sealed hearts, blinded eyes and deaf ears. I have the impression that I am before those [sort of readers] who would prefer works of prolixity, refraining from [referring to] this complementary work, rejecting it outright, tending to obvious obstinacy [regarding it], without addressing its intricacies with any understanding: And whoever is blind in this world shall be blind in the Hereafter [Q. 17:72]. May God thereby provide us with a [way of] guidance to the path of truth, with success, an awareness of the subtle intricacies of His words and with an ascertainment. May He thereby also make us with those to whom God has been gracious from among the prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the righteous \u2014 and excellent companions are they! [Q. 4:69]. He [Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Suy\u016bt\u012b] completed the composition of this [work] on Sunday, 10th of Shaww\u0101l, in the year 870 (AH) [1465 AD], having commenced it on the first Wednesday of Ramad\u0101n of the same year. He completed the fair copy [of this work] on Wednesday, 6th of Safar in the year 871 (AH) [1466 AD], and God knows best. Shaykh Shams al-D\u012bn Muhammad b. Ab\u012b Bakr al-Khat\u012bb al-T\u016bkh\u012b said: my friend the erudite shaykh Kam\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Mahall\u012b, brother of the above-mentioned shaykh of ours, shaykh Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn alMahall\u012b, may God have mercy on both of them, that he saw his brother, the above-mentioned shaykh Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn, in his dream: before him stood our friend the inquiring erudite scholar shaykh Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Suy\u016bt\u012b, compiler of this complement. He [Mahall\u012b] had this complement in his hand and, perusing it, he was saying to its above-mentioned compiler [Suy\u016bt\u012b], \u2018Which of the two is better, my composition or yours?\u2019. He [Suy\u016bt\u012b] said, \u2018Mine\u2019. He [Mahall\u012b] then said, \u2018But look at this \u2026\u2019, and he showed him parts of it, politely pointing out to him his objections thereto. Each time he [Mahall\u012b] brought something up, the compiler of this complement [Suy\u016bt\u012b] would respond to him, while shaykh [Mahall\u012b] would smile and laugh. Our shaykh, the imam, the erudite scholar Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn \u2018Abd al-Rahm\u0101n b. Ab\u012b Bakr al-Suy\u016bt\u012b, compiler of this complement said: What I believe, and what I am absolutely certain of, is that the part composed by shaykh Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-Mahall\u012b, may God have mercy on him, in his section [of the commentary] is actually better than mine by far. How [could it be otherwise], when most of what I have written here draws on his work and relies on it? I have no doubt about this. As regards what was seen in the above-mentioned dream, then perhaps it is the case that the shaykh meant to point out those few places in which I disagreed with what he had written on account of some little comment [that I had made therein]. But these [instances] are very few and I do not think that they add up to more than ten such instances. Among these is where shaykh [al-Mahall\u012b] comments in s\u016brat S\u0101d: \u2018The Spirit is a delicate organism (jism lat\u012bf) that gives life to a human being by permeating it\u2019. I followed this [opinion] at first, but then I remembered the restriction [made by God] while [working on the commentary] at s\u016brat al-Hijr; and so I erased it because of where God says, And they will question you concerning the Spirit. Say, \u2018The Spirit is of the command of my Lord. And of knowledge you have not been given except a little [\u2026]\u2019 [to the end of] the verse [Q. 15:85]. For, it is explicit, or almost explicit, in stating that the [true nature of the] Spirit is of God\u2019s knowledge [only], exalted be He \u2014 we do not know it. Thus, it is better that we should refrain from trying to define it. For this reason also, shaykh T\u0101j al-D\u012bn b. al-Subk\u012b says in [his work] Jam\u2018 al-jaw\u0101mi\u2018 (The compendium of compendiums\u2019): \u2018As for the spirit, Muhammad (s) never spoke about it and we should [also] therefore refrain [from speaking about it].\u2019 Another [instance] is where the shaykh says in [his commentary to] s\u016brat al-Hajj [Q. 22:17], \u2018The Sabaeans (al-s\u0101bi\u2019\u016bn) are a   Jewish sect\u2019. I mention this in [my commentary to] s\u016brat al-Baqara [Q. 2:62], where I added the following [gloss] \u2018or [they are] a Christian [sect]\u2019, in order to point out a variant opinion, generally acknowledged, particularly by our colleagues, the [Sh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b] jurists, and [also acknowledged] by the Minh\u0101j (\u2018The Method [\u2026]\u2019), where it is stated that the Samaritans opposed the Jews and the Sabaeans [opposed] the Christians [respectively] over the fundamentals of their religion. In his [Mahall\u012b\u2019s] Sharh (\u2018Commentary\u2019), al-Sh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b, may God be pleased with him, is reported to have said that the Sabaeans were a Christian sect. At this moment, I cannot recall a third instance [of Mahall\u012b\u2019s objections]. Perhaps these are the sort of examples which the Shaykh, may God have mercy on him, was pointing out [in the dream]. And God knows best what is correct, and to Him is the return and the [final] resort. Meccan, except for verses 28, and from [verses] 82 to the end of 101, which are Medinese; it consists of 110 or 115 verses, revealed after s\u016brat al-Gh\u0101shiya.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And say: Praise be to Allah) gratitude and divinity are Allah's, (Who hath not taken unto Himself a son) from amongst the angels or humans such that he inherits His dominion, (and Who hath no partner in the Sovereignty) such that he shows enmity towards Him, (nor hath He any protecting friend) a helper (through dependence) from among the Jews and Christians; it is also said that this means: He has not been humiliated such that He needs a helper from the Jews or Christians. (And magnify Him with all magnificence) deem Him far exalted above what the Jews, Christians and idolaters say about Him; and Allah knows better the secrets of His Book. And of the surah in which the Cave is mentioned, which is all Meccan except for two Medinan verses in which 'Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari was mentioned, and it consists of 111 verses, 1,567 words and 6,460 letters: Surah 18: The Cave (al-Kahf) And of the surah in which the Cave is mentioned, which is all Meccan except for two Medinan verses in which 'Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari was mentioned, and it consists of 111 verses, 1,567 words and 6,460 letters:\n"
