We made the sign of the night devoid of light, and made the sign of the day radiant that you may seek the bounty of your Lord and know the computation of years and numbers. Thus We have expounded everything in detail to keep everything distinct from the other.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "We have made the day and night each as evidence (of Our existence).
