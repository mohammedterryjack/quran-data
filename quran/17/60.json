        "TRANSLATION_0": "When We said to you, 'Surely your Lord encompasses the people with His knowledge.' We only appointed the vision We showed you and the Accursed Tree in the Qur'an as a trial and temptation for the people. We frighten them, but it only increases them in their excessive insolence.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "When We said to you: \"Verily your Lord circumscribes mankind,\" and showed you the vision and the accursed tree of the Qur'an, it was as a bone of contention for men. Thus do We (instil) fear in them; but they only transgress the more.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "And recall when We said to you, (O Muhammad), that your Lord encompasses these people; and that We have made that vision that We have shown you, and the tree accursed in the Qur'an, but as a trial for people. We go about warning them, but each warning leads them to greater transgression.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "(Muhammad), We told you that your Lord has encompassed all mankind. We made the vision which We showed you and the condemned tree, mentioned in the Quran, as a trial for the human being. Even though We warn them, it only increases their rebellion.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And when We proclaimed to you, \u201cIndeed all mankind is within the control of your Lord\u201d; and We did not create the spectacle* which We showed you except to try mankind, and the Tree** which is cursed in the Qur\u2019an; and We warn them \u2013 so nothing increases for them except extreme rebellion. (* The Ascent of the Holy Prophet to the heavens and beyond, which the disbelievers denied as just a dream. ** The Zakkum tree which will grow in hell and be the food for its inhabitants.)\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "And (remember) when We told you: \"Verily, your Lord has encompassed mankind.\" And We made not the vision which We showed you but a trial for mankind, and (likewise) the accursed tree in the Qur'an. We warn and make them afraid but it only increases them in naught save great disbelief, oppression and disobedience to Allah.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "And when We said to you: Surely your Lord encompasses men; and We did not make the vision which We showed you but a trial for men and the cursed tree in the Quran as well; and We cause them to fear, but it only adds to their great inordinacy.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "And when We said to thee, 'Surely thy Lord encompasses men,' and We made the vision that We showed thee and the tree cursed in the Koran to be only a trial for men; and We frighten them, but it only increases them in great insolence.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "And (it was a warning) when we told thee: Lo! thy Lord encompasseth mankind, and We appointed the sight which We showed thee as an ordeal for mankind, and (likewise) the Accursed Tree in the Qur'an. We warn them, but it increaseth them in naught save gross impiety.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "We told you that your Lord encompasses mankind. We granted the vision which We showed you, as well as the tree that is cursed in the Quran, only as a test for mankind. We warn them, but this only increases their insolence.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "And recall what time We said unto thee: verily thy Lord hath encompassed mankind. And We made the vision We shewed thee but a temptation for men, and likewise the tree accurst in the Qur'an. And We frighten them, but it only increaseth them in exorbitance great.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "When We said to you, \u2018Indeed your Lord encircles those people,\u2019 We did not appoint the vision that We showed you except as a tribulation for the people and the tree cursed in the Quran. We warn them, but it only increases them in their outrageous rebellion.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "Behold! We told thee that thy Lord doth encompass mankind round about: We granted the vision which We showed thee, but as a trial for men,- as also the Cursed Tree (mentioned) in the Qur'an: We put terror (and warning) into them, but it only increases their inordinate transgression!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "And (remember) when We told you: \"Verily! Your Lord has encompassed mankind (i.e. they are in His Grip).\" And We made not the vision which we showed you (O Muhammad as an actual eye-witness and not as a dream on the night of Al-Isra') but a trial for mankind, and likewise the accursed tree (Zaqqum, mentioned) in the Quran. We warn and make them afraid but it only increases them in naught save great disbelief, oppression and disobedience to Allah.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "When We said to you: 'Indeed, your Lord encompasses all people' We did not make the vision which We showed to you, and the tree cursed in the Koran except to be a trial for people, and We frighten them, but it only increases them in great insolence.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "We said to you that your Lord encompasses humanity. We did not make the vision We showed you, except as a test for the people, and the tree cursed in the Quran. We frighten them, but that only increases their defiance.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "And [remember, O Muhammad], when We told you, \"Indeed, your Lord has encompassed the people.\" And We did not make the sight which We showed you except as a trial for the people, as was the accursed tree [mentioned] in the Qur'an. And We threaten them, but it increases them not except in great transgression.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[17:60] And, remember, when We said to you, \u2018Truly your Lord encompasses mankind\u2019, in knowledge and power [over them], such that they are within His grasp: so deliver the Message to them and do not fear anyone, because God will protect you from them. And We did not appoint the vision that We showed you, before your very eyes, during the Night Journey, except as a test for people, [for] the people of Mecca \u2014 since they denied it and some of them [even] apostatised when he [the Prophet] informed them of it \u2014 and [likewise] the tree cursed in the Qur\u2019\u0101n, namely, the [tree called] Zaqq\u016bm [Q.37:62ff] that issues from the very root of the Blazing Fire [of Hell]; We made it a test for them, because they said, \u2018Fire consumes trees, so how can it cause it [the Zaqq\u016bm tree] to issue forth?\u2019. And We [seek to] deter them, with it, but it, Our deterrence, only increases them in gross insolence.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And (it was a warning) when We told thee: Lo! thy Lord encompasseth mankind) He is aware of the people of Mecca: those who will believe and those who will not, (and We appointed the vision) We did not show you the vision (which We showed thee) in your nocturnal ascension (as an ordeal for mankind) as a misfortune for the people of Mecca, (and (likewise) the Accursed Tree in the Qur'an) and the same applies to the mention of the Zaqqum tree in the Qur'an. (We warn them) by the Zaqqum tree, (but it) the warning (increaseth them in naught save gross impiety) save further engagement in transgression.\n"
