In fact, these people were hypocrites who kept reiterating: \"0 Messenger of Allah! We are true believers, so do feed us and be generous with us\". When Allah mentioned their claim, the wandering Arabs of Banu Asad said: \"We are genuine in our faith in Allah and His Messenger\". But Allah said: (Say) to them, Muhammad: (Ye believe not) you are not genuine in your faith in Allah and His Messenger, (but rather say \"We submit\") we submit so that we may be spared from the sword and captivity, (for the faith hath not yet entered into your hearts) for love and sincerity of faith have 603 not entered your hearts. (Yet, if ye obey Allah and His messenger) inwardly as you obey him outwardly and repent of inward disbelief and hypocrisy, (He will not withhold from you aught of (the reward of) your deeds) He will not diminish the reward of your works. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives whoever repent of you, (Merciful) towards whoever dies repentant.\n"
