He already feared them on account of an old feud between him and them from the time of pagandom [before Islam], and so [upon seeing them come out to him] he returned and claimed that they had refused to give the voluntary alms and intended to kill him. And just as the Prophet (s) was making plans to raid them, they came to him to disavow what he [al-Wal\u012bd] had said about them: O you who believe, if a reprobate should come to you with some tiding, some piece of information, verify [it], [ascertain] his truthfulness from his mendacity (fa-tabayyan\u016b: a variant reading has fa-tathabbat\u016b, from al-thab\u0101t, \u2018to ascertain\u2019), lest you injure a folk (an tus\u012bb\u016b qawman, an object denoting reason), that is to say, for fear of this [happening], out of ignorance (bi-jah\u0101latin is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject [of the verb]), that is to say while you are ignorant; and then become remorseful of what you have perpetrated, erroneously against that folk. After they had returned to their homelands, the Prophet (s) sent Kh\u0101lid [b. al-Wal\u012bd] to them, who observed only obedience and goodness in them and [later] informed the Prophet of this.\n",

If an evil-liver) this was revealed about al-Walid Ibn 'Uqbah Ibn Ma'it who was sent by the Prophet (pbuh) to Banu'l-Mustaliq to collect their alms; instead he came back claiming that they wanted to kill him. The Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions were about to set forth to conquer them but Allah forbade them from doing so, saying: you who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an if a hypocrite, al-Walid Ibn 'Uqbah, (bring you tidings) brings you news about Banu'l-Mustaliq, (verify it) check whether the news are true or false, (lest ye smite some folk in ignorance and afterward repent of what ye did) regret killing them.\n"
