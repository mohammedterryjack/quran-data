We have indeed created you from a male and a female, [from] Adam and Eve, and made you nations (shu\u2018\u016bb is the plural of sha\u2018b, which is the broadest category of lineage) and tribes (qab\u0101\u2019il, which are smaller than nations, and are followed by \u2018am\u0101\u2019ir, \u2018tribal districts\u2019, then but\u016bn, \u2018tribal sub-districts\u2019, then afkh\u0101dh, \u2018sub-tribes\u2019, and finally fas\u0101\u2019il, \u2018clans\u2019; for example Khuzayma is the sha\u2018b, while Kin\u0101na is the qab\u012bla, Quraysh is the \u2018im\u0101ra, Qusayy is the batn, H\u0101shim is the fakhdh, and \u2018Abb\u0101s is the fas\u012bla) that you may come to know one another (ta\u2018\u0101raf\u016b: one of the two t\u0101\u2019 letters [of tata\u2018\u0101raf\u016b] has been omitted), that you may acquire knowledge of [the customs of] one another and not to boast to one another of [whose is the more] noble lineage, for pride lies only in [the extent to which you have] fear of God. Truly the noblest of you in the sight of God is the most God-fearing among you. Truly God is Knower, of you, Aware, of your inner thoughts.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(0 mankind!) This was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas who said to a man: \"You are the son of so-and-so\" in reference to his mother; and it is also said that it was revealed about Bilal the muezzin of the Prophet (pbuh). When Bilal gave the call to prayer in Mecca after its conquest, a group of men from Quraysh, among whom were Sahl Ibn 'Amr, al-Harth Ibn Hisham and Abu Sufyan Ibn Harb, said: \"Did Allah and His Messenger not find anyone to call to prayer except this raven\". In response, Allah said: (Lo! We have created you male and female) from Adam and Eve, (and have made you nations and tribes that ye may know one another. Lo! the noblest of you) in the Hereafter, (in the sight of Allah) on the Day of Judgement, (is the best in conduct) in the life of the world; which in this case is Bilal. (Lo! Allah is Knower) of your status and lineage, (Aware) of your works and standing in His sight.\n"
