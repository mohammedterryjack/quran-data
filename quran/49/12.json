        "TRANSLATION_17": "[49:12] O you who believe, shun much suspicion. Indeed some suspicions are sins, that is to say, it causes one to fall into sin. This [suspicion] may have many forms, such as thinking ill of the good folk from among the believers \u2014 and such [good folk] are many \u2014 in contrast to the immoral individuals among them in whose case there is no sin, so long as it [the suspicion] is in accordance with their outward behaviour. And do not spy (tajassas\u016b: one of the two t\u0101\u2019 letters [of tatajassas\u016b] has been omitted): do not pursue the imperfections and faults of Muslims by searching them out; nor backbite one another, do not speak of him by [mentioning] something which he is averse to [having mentioned of himself], even if it be true. Would any of you love to eat the flesh of his brother dead? (read maytan or mayyitan). That is to say, it would not be right for him [to do so]. You would abhor it. Thus to backbite him in life would be like eating his flesh when he is dead. This latter [form of behaviour] has been suggested to you and you were averse to it, so be averse to the former too. And fear God, that is, His punishment for backbiting, by repenting of it; assuredly God is Relenting, accepting of the penitence of those who repent, Merciful, to them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(0 ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (Shun much suspicion) this was revealed about two Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) who backbit Salman al-Farisi and also thought ill of Usamah, the Servant of Allah's Messenger (pbuh). They spied on him to see whether Usamah did really have what the Prophet (pbuh) asked him to give to them. Allah therefore forbade them from having a bad opinion about others, as well as from suspicion and spying; and so He said: you who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, shun much suspicion about your brother's ins and outs (for lo! some suspicion is a crime) for some ill thoughts and what you hide are sins; this is what the two men thought of Usamah. (And spy not) and do not scrutinise the faults of your brother, nor reveal that which Allah has concealed about him; and this is exactly what the two men did, (neither backbite one another) the two backbit Salman. (Would one of you love to eat the flesh of his dead brother) unlawfully without any necessity? (Ye abhor that (so abhor the other)) you deem eating the flesh of a carrion unlawful unless it is out of necessity, consider backbiting your brother likewise! (And keep your duty (to Allah)) fear Allah regarding backbiting anyone. (Lo! Allah is Relenting) Allah forgives whoever repents of backbiting, (Merciful) towards whoever die repentant.\n"
