        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Lo! those who call thee from behind the private apartment) this was revealed about a folk from Banu 'Anbar, from the Khuza'ah tribe to whom the Prophet (pbuh) sent a military expedition under the leadership of 'Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari. When they heard of the advance of this expedition towards them, they fled, leaving behind their wives and children and properties. Their wives and children were taken captive and brought to the Prophet (pbuh). The men who fled went to Medina to ransom their wives and children and entered the city at the time of the siesta. They called: \"0 Muhammad, come out to see us\", while he was 601 sleeping. Allah censured them for doing so, saying: (Lo! those who call you from behind the private apartment most of them) all of them (have no sense) do not understand Allah's command or divine Oneness nor the reverence due to Allah's Messenger.\n"
