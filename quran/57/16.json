Many of them are deviators.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Has the moment not yet come when the hearts of believers should be moved by the thought of God and the truth that has been sent down, so that they should not be like those who received the Book before them but whose hearts were hardened after a lapse of time, and many of them turned disobedient?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Is the time not come that the hearts of the believers should be humbled to Allah's remembrance and to the Truth that He has revealed, and that they should not be like those who were vouchsafed the Book and then a long time elapsed so that their hearts were hardened? A great many of them are now evil-doers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Is it not time for the hearts of the believers to become humbled by the remembrance of God and by the Truth which has been revealed so that they will not be like the followers of the Bible who lived before them and whose hearts have become hard like stone through the long years. Many of them are evil doers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Has not the time come for the believers to surrender their hearts to Allah\u2019s remembrance and to this truth that has come down? And do not be like those who were earlier given the Book(s) and when a long term passed over them, their hearts became hardened; and many of them are sinners.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Has not the time yet come for the believers that their hearts should be humble for the remembrance of Allah And that which has been revealed of the truth, lest they become as those who received the Scripture before, and the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened And many of them were rebellious.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "Has not the time yet come for those who believe that their hearts should be humble for the remembrance of Allah and what has come down of the truth? And that they should not be like those who were given the Book before, but the time became prolonged to them, so their hearts hardened, and most of them are transgressors.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "Is it not time that the hearts of those who believe should be humbled to the Remembrance of God and the Truth which He has sent down, and that they should not be as those to whom the Book was given aforetime, and the term seemed over long to them, so that their hearts have become hard, and many of them are ungodly?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Is not the time ripe for the hearts of those who believe to submit to Allah's reminder and to the truth which is revealed, that they become not as those who received the scripture of old but the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened, and many of them are evil-livers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "Has the time not come for the faithful when their hearts in all humility should engage in the remembrance of God and of the revelation of truth, so that they should not become like those who were given the Book before them, whose hearts with the passage of time became hardened and many of whom were disobedient?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "Is not the time yet come unto those who believe, that their hearts should humble themselves to the admonition of Allah and to the truth which hath come down, and that they become not as those who were vouchsafed the Book aforetime, and the time become extended unto them, and so their hearts became hard? And many of them are transgressors\n",

Time took its toll on them and so their hearts were hardened, and many of them are transgressors.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "Has not the Time arrived for the Believers that their hearts in all humility should engage in the remembrance of Allah and of the Truth which has been revealed (to them), and that they should not become like those to whom was given Revelation aforetime, but long ages passed over them and their hearts grew hard? For many among them are rebellious transgressors.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "Has not the time come for the hearts of those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism) to be affected by Allah's Reminder (this Quran), and that which has been revealed of the truth, lest they become as those who received the Scripture [the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] before (i.e. Jews and Christians), and the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened? And many of them were Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "Is it not time that the hearts of the believers be humbled to the Remembrance of Allah and the truth which He has sent down? They should not be like those who were given the Book before this, whose time became very long so that their hearts became hardened. Many of them were impious.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_16": "Has the time not come for those who have believed that their hearts should become humbly submissive at the remembrance of Allah and what has come down of the truth? And let them not be like those who were given the Scripture before, and a long period passed over them, so their hearts hardened; and many of them are defiantly disobedient.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[57:16] Is it not time for those who believe \u2014 this was revealed concerning the matter of the Companions [of the Prophet] who had been overindulging in jest, that their hearts should be humbled to the remembrance of God and [to] what has been revealed (read as nuzzila; or read nazala, \u2018[what] has come down\u2019) of the truth, the Qur\u2019\u0101n, and that they should not be (l\u0101 yak\u016bn\u016b is a supplement to takhsha\u2018a, \u2018be humbled\u2019) like those who were given the Scripture before?, namely, the Jews and the Christians. For the stretch of time, the interval [extending] from them [back] to [the time of the sending of the last of] their prophets, was too long for them and so their hearts became hardened, unyielding to the remembrance of God, and many of them are immoral.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Then Allah mentioned the state of their hearts when they were in the life of the world, saying: (Is not the time ripe for the hearts of those who believe) outwardly (to submit) to soften, abase itself and be sincere (to Allah's reminder) to Allah's promises and threats; it is also said this means: to Allah's divine Oneness (and to the Truth which is revealed) to the commands and prohibitions, the lawful and unlawful contained in the Qur'an, (that they become not as those who received the Scripture) that they became like those who were given the knowledge of the Torah (of old) before the advent of Muhammad (pbuh) and so they are the folk of the Torah (but the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened) regarding faith; these are the ones who went against the religion of Moses, (and many of them) of the folk of the Torah (are evil-livers) disbelievers who do not believe in Allah as it is in Allah's foreknowledge.\n"
