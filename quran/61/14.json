So a group of the Children of Israel believed, in Jesus, saying: \u2018He is [indeed] the servant of God, [who has been] raised to heaven\u2019, while a group disbelieved, because they said that he was the son of God, whom He had raised unto Himself.

(They said) his disciples said: (We are Allah's helpers) we are your helpers, along with Allah, against His enemies. They were 12 male disciples, the first to believe in him and help him against his enemies. All of these men were believers. (And a party of the Children of Israel believed) in Jesus the son of Mary, (while a party disbelieved) in Jesus son of Mary. This is the party that was led astray by Paul and did not believe in him. (Then We strengthened) We helped and fortified (those who believed) in Jesus the son of Mary and did not oppose his religion (against their foe) those who opposed the religion of Jesus, (and they became the uppermost) in argument against their foes because of their prayer to Allah, and it is also said because they were among those who glorified Allah'.
