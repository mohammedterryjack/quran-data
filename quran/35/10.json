        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Whoso desireth power) i.e. whoever desires to know to whom belongs power, might and invincibility, ((should know that) all power belongeth to Allah) as belongs to Him might and invincibility. (Unto Him good words) the expression \"there is no deity save Allah\" (ascend, and the pious deed doth He exalt) He accepts pious deeds through the profession of \"there is no deity except Allah\"; (but those who plot iniquities) those who associate partners with Allah; it is also said this means: those who scheme to expel, imprison or assassinate Muhammad (pbuh) in Dar al-Nadwah, (theirs will be an awful doom) as awful as can be; (and the plotting of such (folk)) i.e. Abu Jahl and his host (will come to naught) will not succeed. It is also said that this verse was revealed about the people who deal with usury.\n"
