        "TRANSLATION_1": "Can he, the evil of whose deed is made to look attractive to him so that he considers it good, (be like him who is guided)? God leads whosoever He please astray and guides whosoever He will. So do not waste away your self with grief for them. God is indeed cognisant of things they do.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "(How awful is the straying of the person) for whom his evil deed has been embellished so that it looks fair to him? The fact is that Allah causes whomsoever He will to fall into error and shows the Right Way to whomsoever He will. So, (O Prophet), let not your life go to waste sorrowing over them. Allah is well aware of all that they do.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Can one whose evil deeds seem attractive and virtuous to him (be compared to a truly righteous person)? God guides or causes to go astray whomever He wants. (Muhammad), do not be grieved because of their disbelief. God knows well whatever they do.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "So will one whose misdeeds are made seeming good to him \u2013 so he deems them good \u2013 be ever equal to the one who is upon guidance? Therefore indeed Allah sends astray whomever He wills, and guides whomever He wills; so may not your life be lost in despairing after them; Allah knows their deeds very well.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Is he, then, to whom the evil of his deeds is made fairseeming, so that he considers it as good Verily, Allah sends astray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. So destroy not yourself in sorrow for them. Truly, Allah is the All-Knower of what they do!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "What! is he whose evil deed is made fairseeming to him so much so that he considers it good? Now surely Allah makes err whom He pleases and guides aright whom He pleases, so let not your soul waste away in grief for them; surely Allah is Cognizant of what they do\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "And what of him, the evil of whose deeds has been decked out fair to him, so that he thinks it is good? God leads astray whomsoever He will, and whomsoever He will He guides; so let not thy soul be wasted in regrets for them; God has knowledge of the things they work.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Is he, the evil of whose deeds is made fairseeming unto him so that he deemeth it good, (other than Satan's dupe)? Allah verily sendeth whom He will astray, and guideth whom He will; so let not thy soul expire in sighings for them. Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do!\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "Is he whose evil deeds are made alluring to him so that he looks upon them as good, [equal to the man who is rightly guided]?

        "TRANSLATION_15": "What of him whose evil deed was made attractive to him, and so he regards it as good? God leads astray whomever He wills, and He guides whomever He wills. Therefore, do not waste yourself sorrowing over them. God knows exactly what they do.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "Then is one to whom the evil of his deed has been made attractive so he considers it good [like one rightly guided]? For indeed, Allah sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. So do not let yourself perish over them in regret. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of what they do.\n",

(a-fa-man, \u2018is he [whose]\u2019 constitutes the subject, the predicate of which is [an omitted] \u2018like one whom God has guided?\u2019 No! And this [predicate] is indicated by [what follows]). Indeed God leads astray whomever He will and guides whomever He will. So do not let your soul expire for their sake, for those to whom it has made [to seem] fair, out of sighings, by becoming anguished lest they do not believe. Indeed God is Knower of what they do, and He will requite them for it.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Is he, the evil of whose deeds is made fair-seeming unto him so that he deemeth it good) right-the reference here is to Abu Jahl-like those whom We honoured with faith and obedience, i.e. Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and his fellow believers? (Allah verily sendeth whom He will astray) He sends away from His religion whoever deserves it, (and guideth) to His religion (whom He will) whoever deserves it, i.e. Abu Bakr and his fellow believers, (so let not thy soul expire) do not kill yourself with grief (in sighings for them) in remorse about their destruction, if they reject faith. (Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do) in their state of disbelief of scheming in Dar al-Nadwah and treachery in order to kill Muhammad (pbuh)!\n"
