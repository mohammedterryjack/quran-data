        "TRANSLATION_1": "It is God who created you from dust, then from a sperm, then formed you into pairs. Neither does a female conceive nor gives birth without His knowledge; nor do the old grow older or become younger in years but in accordance with the law (of nature). Indeed the law of God works inevitably.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Allah created you from dust, then from a drop of sperm, then He made you into pairs. No female conceives, nor delivers (a child) except with His knowledge. None is given a long life nor is any diminished in his life but it is written in a Book. Surely that is quite easy for Allah.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "God created you from clay which He then turned into a living germ and made you into pairs. No female conceives or delivers without His knowledge. No one grows older nor can anything be reduced from one's life without having its record in the Book. This is not at all difficult for God.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And Allah created you from clay, then a drop of liquid, then made you as couples; and no female conceives or gives birth except with His knowledge; and every aged being that is given the age, and every one whose life is kept short \u2013 all this is in a Book; indeed this is easy for Allah.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_6": "And Allah created you of dust, then of the life-germ, then He made you pairs; and no female bears, nor does she bring forth, except with His knowledge; and no one whose life is lengthened has his life lengthened, nor is aught diminished of one's life, but it is all in a book; surely this is easy to Allah.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "God created you of dust then of a sperm-drop, then He made you pairs. No female bears or brings forth, save with His knowledge; and none is given long life who is given long life neither is any diminished in his life, but it is in a Book. Surely that is easy for God.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Allah created you from dust, then from a little fluid, then He made you pairs (the male and female). No female beareth or bringeth forth save with His knowledge.

        "TRANSLATION_14": "Allah created you from dust, then from a (sperm) drop. Then he made you pairs. No female conceives or is delivered except by His Knowledge. He whose life is long, whatsoever is increased or decreased of his age is in a Clear Book. Surely, that is easy for Allah.\n",

And no female bears or brings forth except with His knowledge (ill\u0101 bi-\u2018ilmihi is a circumstantial qualifier, in other words, \u2018[except] that it is known by Him\u2019) and no long-living person is given long life, in other words, the life of none is increased for one who has a long life, nor is anything diminished of his life, in other words, [of the life of] that same long-living person or some other long-living person, but it is [recorded] in a Book, namely, the Preserved Tablet. Surely that is easy for God.\n",

(And no one groweth old who groweth old, nor is aught lessened of his life, but it is recorded in a Book) except that it is recorded in the Guarded Tablet. (Lo! That) recording that (is easy for Allah) even without writing.\n"
