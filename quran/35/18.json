        "TRANSLATION_1": "No one who carries a burden bears another's load; and even if the burdened soul cry out for help none will carry the least of its burden, however close a relative it may be. You can only warn those who fear their Lord in secret and fulfil their devotional obligations. Whoever grows in goodness does so for himself. To God is the journeying back.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "No one can bear another's burden. If a heavily laden one should call another to carry his load, none of it shall be carried by the other, even though he be a near of kin.

You can only warn those who fear their Lord in secret, in other words, those who fear Him despite not having seen Him, for they are the ones to benefit from the warning, and observe the prayer, maintain [performance of] it. For whoever purifies himself, cleansing himself of idolatry and other [similar abominations], is purifying himself only for [the sake of] his own soul, because the reforming of his self pertains to him. And to God is the [end of the] journeying, the return in the Hereafter when He will requite according to deeds.\n",

(Thou warnest only) your warning, Muhammad, benefits only (those who fear their Lord in secret) those who work for their Lord even though He is invisible to them, but nothing is invisible to Him, (and have established worship) and perform the five daily prayers. (He who groweth (in goodness)) he who believes in Allah's divine Oneness, does good works and spends of his wealth in charity, (groweth only for himself) the reward of all this goes to his own soul. (Unto Allah is the journeying) unto Allah is the return in the Hereafter.\n"
