You offer, you communicate to, them, the Prophet\u2019s plan (s) to attack them, which he had confided to you, and had kept secret, at Hunayn, [communicating this to them out of], affection, between you and them. H\u0101tib b. Ab\u012b Balta\u2018a sent them a letter to that effect, on account of his having children and close relatives, idolaters, among them. The Prophet (s) intercepted it from the person to whom he [H\u0101tib] had given it to deliver, after God apprised him of this. H\u0101tib\u2019s excuse for this [conduct of his] was accepted [by the Prophet]; when verily they have disbelieved in the truth that has come to you, that is, [in] the religion of Islam and the Qur\u2019\u0101n, expelling the Messenger and you, from Mecca, by oppressing you, because you believe in God, your Lord. If you have gone forth to struggle in My way and to seek My pleasure \u2026 (the response to the conditional is indicated by what preceded, that is to say, [understand it as being] \u2018then do not take them as friends\u2019). You secretly harbour affection for them, when I know well what you hide and what you proclaim. And whoever among you does that, that is, to secretly communicate the Prophet\u2019s news to them, has verily strayed from the right way, he has missed the path of guidance (originally, al-saw\u0101\u2019 means \u2018the middle [way]\u2019).\n",

(Do ye give them friendship) you send them a letter to assist and help them (when they disbelieve in that truth which hath come unto you) i.e. to Hatib, (driving out the messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) from Mecca (and you) i.e. Hatib (because ye believe) because of your faith (in Allah, your Lord? If ye have come forth) if you have, Hatib, come forth from Mecca to Medina (to strive in My way) for the sake of My obedience (and seeking My good pleasure, (show them not friendship). Do ye show friendship unto them in secret) do not send letters to them in secret to assist and help them, (when I am best Aware of what ye hide) i.e. of what you hide, Hatib, regarding the letter; and it is also said that this means: regarding your faith (and what ye proclaim) Hatib, of excuse; and it is also said: of profession of Allah's divine Oneness? (And whosoever doeth it among you) whoever of you, believers, does as Hatib did, (he verily hath strayed from the right way) he has indeed strayed from the path of guidance.\n"
