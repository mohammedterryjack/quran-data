As for his saying: but I cannot avail you anything against God\u2019 \u2014 that is, either against His chastisement or [to secure for you of] His reward \u2014 he [Abraham] is using it to intimate [to his father] that he can do nothing for him other than to ask forgiveness [for him], which [saying] is itself based on that [former statement] albeit excepted [from it] in terms of what is meant by it, even if on the face of it, it would seem to be [semantically] part of the [good] example to be followed: Say, \u2018Who can avail you anything against God\u2019 [Q. 48:11]; his [Abraham\u2019s] plea of forgiveness for him was before it became evident to him that he [his father] was an enemy of God, as mentioned in s\u016brat Bar\u0101\u2019a [Q. 9:114]. \u2018Our Lord, in You we put our trust, and to You we turn [penitently], and to You is the journeying: these are the words of the Friend [of God, Abraham] and those who were with him, in other words, they were saying:\n",

(We have done with you) we absolve ourselves from you and from your religion. (And there hath arisen between us and you hostility) through killing and beating (and hate) in the hearts (for ever until ye believe in Allah only) until you declare Allah's divine Oneness (save that which Abraham promised) save the words of Abraham to (his father (when he said): I will ask forgiveness for thee) because he promised him to do so, but when his father died in a state of disbelief, Abraham disavowed him, saying: (though I own nothing for thee from Allah) from Allah's chastisement.
