The blind man was not aware that he was busy with these and so he called out to him, \u2018Teach me of what God has taught you\u2019. However, the Prophet (s) went off to his house. He was then reproached for this with what was revealed in this s\u016bra.

        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Because the blind man came unto him) when 'Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum came to him. His real name is 'Abdullah Ibn Shurayh. Umm Maktum was his father's mother. What happened is that the Prophet (pbuh) was sitting with a group of men among the nobles of Quraysh, among whom were his uncle al-'Abbas Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, Umayyah Ibn Khalaf al-Jumahi and Safwan Ibn Umayyah, who were at that time disbelievers. The Prophet (pbuh) was admonishing and inviting them to Islam when Ibn Maktum came to him and said: \"O Messenger of Allah! Teach me of that which Allah has taught you\". The Prophet (pbuh) turned his face from him because he was busy with these people. When this happened Allah revealed: he frowned and turned away because the blind man came unto him.\n"
