God is a proper noun for the One truly worthy of worship; Lord of all Worlds, that is, [He is] the One Who owns all of creation: humans, jinn, angels, animals and others as well, each of which may be referred to as a \u2018world\u2019; one says \u2018the world of men\u2019, or \u2018world of the jinn\u2019 etc. This plural form with the y\u0101\u2019 and the n\u016bn [sc. \u2018\u0101lam\u012bn] is used to denote, predominantly, cognizant beings (\u016bl\u016b \u2018ilm). The expression [\u2018\u0101lam\u012bn] relates to [the term] \u2018sign\u2019 (\u2018al\u0101ma), since it is an indication of the One that created it.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "And on his authority it is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, regarding the saying of Allah, Exalted is He, (Praise be to Allah): 'He says: laudation is Allah's in that He is kind towards His created beings and, hence, they praise Him. It is also said that laudation is Allah's because of His excessive blessings upon His servants whom He has guided to believe in Him. It is also said: laudation, absolute unity and godhood all belong to Allah Who has neither progeny, partner, helper nor an assistant. (Lord of the worlds): Lord of any that has a spirit and walks about on the face of the earth and also of the dwellers of heaven. It is also said that this means: the Master of the jinn and human beings. It is also said that (Lord of the worlds) means the Creator of all created beings, their Provider and the One Who changes them from one state into another.\n"
