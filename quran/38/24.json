He begged forgiveness from his Lord and fell down prone, prostrating, and repented.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "(David) said: \"He is unjust in demanding your ewe to add to his (many) ewes. Many partners are surely -- unjust to one another, except those who believe and do the right; but there are only a few of them.\" It occurred to David that he was being tried by Us, and he begged his Lord to forgive him, and fell down in homage and repented.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_3": "David said, \"He has certainly been unjust in demanding your ewe from you.

        "TRANSLATION_12": "(David) said: \"He has undoubtedly wronged thee in demanding thy (single) ewe to be added to his (flock of) ewes: truly many are the partners (in business) who wrong each other: Not so do those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, and how few are they?\"... and David gathered that We had tried him: he asked forgiveness of his Lord, fell down, bowing (in prostration), and turned (to Allah in repentance).\n",

        "TRANSLATION_15": "He said, \u201cHe has done you wrong by asking your ewe in addition to his ewes. Many partners take advantage of one another, except those who believe and do good deeds, but these are so few.\u201d David realized that We were testing him, so he sought forgiveness from his Lord, and fell down to his knees, and repented.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "[David] said, \"He has certainly wronged you in demanding your ewe [in addition] to his ewes. And indeed, many associates oppress one another, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds - and few are they.\" And David became certain that We had tried him, and he asked forgiveness of his Lord and fell down bowing [in prostration] and turned in repentance [to Allah].\n",

And indeed many associates infringe upon [the rights of] one another, except such as believe and perform righteous deeds, but few are they!\u2019 (m\u0101 emphasises the \u2018fewness\u2019). As the two angels were ascending to the heaven one said to the other, \u2018He has certainly passed judgement on himself!\u2019 David was thus alerted [to his deed]. God, exalted be He, says: And David thought, in other words, he became certain, that We had indeed tried him, that We had caused him to fall into a trial, that is, a test, through his love for that woman. So he sought forgiveness of his Lord and fell down bowing, in other words, prostrate, and repented.\n",

And the two went out from whence they came. (And David guessed) he knew and was certain (that We had tried him) because of the sin he committed, (and he sought forgiveness of his Lord) from his sin, (and he bowed himself and fell down prostrate and repented) feeling remorse for what he did.\n"
