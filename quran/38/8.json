In other words, it could not have been revealed to him (read aunzila pronouncing both hamzas, or not pronouncing the second one, but in both cases inserting an intervening alif or without [this insertion]). God, exalted be He, says: Nay, but they are in doubt concerning My Remembrance, My revelation, that is, the Qur\u2019\u0101n, for they deny the one who has brought it. Nay, but they have not yet tasted My chastisement, and if they were to taste it, they would certainly believe the Prophet (s) in what he has brought \u2014 but then [in such a case] their belief [in the Prophet] would be of no benefit to them.\n",
