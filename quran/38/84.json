As for reading the first one in the accusative, this would be on account of the mentioned verb [q\u0101la, \u2018he said\u2019]; but it is also said to be on account of its being a verbal noun, the sense being uhiqqu l-haqqa, \u2018I establish the truth\u2019; or [it is in the accusative by implication] if the particle for the oath [fa] is removed. It [the first haqq] could also be in the nominative because of its being the subject of a missing predicate, as in fa\u2019l-haqqu minn\u012b, \u2018truth [comes] from Me\u2019. It is also said that [the sentence means] fa\u2019l-haqqu qasam\u012b, \u2018the truth is [this] oath from Me\u2019, the response to which is the following [la-amla\u2019anna \u2026]) \u2014\n",
