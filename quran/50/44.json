That is an easy gathering for Us (dh\u0101lika hashrun \u2018alayn\u0101 yas\u012br: there is here a separation of the noun from its adjective by what is semantically connected to it, for the purpose of specification \u2014 which is [rhetorically] unobjectionable; dh\u0101lika, \u2018that\u2019, is meant to point out the signification of the \u2018gathering\u2019, which itself is [also] predicated by this [demonstrative particle], and this signification is the bringing back to life after extinction and the assembly for the exposition and the reckoning [before God]).\n",
