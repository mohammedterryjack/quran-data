The preclusion of weariness in His case is [absolute] on account of His transcending of the attributes of creatures and the non-existence of any contiguity between Him and other [beings]: His command, when He wills a thing, is just to say to it \u2018Be\u2019, and it is [Q. 36:82].\n",

The enemies of Allah have lied against Allah.\n"
