(No laden soul will bear another's load) no soul will bear the sins of another; it is also said that this means: no soul will be taken to task for the sins of another soul, for each soul will be taken to task for its own sins; and it is also said that this means: no soul will be punished for no crime. (Then unto your Lord is your return) after death; (and He will tell you) on the Day of Judgement (what ye used to do) and say in the life of this world. (Lo! He knoweth what is in the breasts (of men)) of good and evil.\n"
