Are the two equal in comparison? (mathalan, for specification), in other words, the slave of many [masters] is not the same as the slave of a single person. For in the case of the former, if all of his masters were to demand his service simultaneously, he would be confused as to whom of them he should serve \u2014 which is the similitude of the idolater; the latter [the slave of one] is the similitude of the one who believes in the One God. Praise be to God!, alone. Nay, but most of them, that is, the people of Mecca, do not know, the chastisement in which they will end up and so they associate others with God.\n",

(Are the two equal in similitude) are the disbeliever and believer equal? (Praise be to Allah) divine Oneness and praise belong to Allah! (But most of them know not) the similitudes of the Qur'an.\n"
