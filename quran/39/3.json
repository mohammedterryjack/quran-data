        "TRANSLATION_0": "Indeed is the sincere deen not Allah's alone? If people take protectors besides Him - 'We only worship them so that they may bring us nearer to Allah' - Allah will judge between them regarding the things about which they differed. Allah does not guide anyone who is an ungrateful liar.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Remember that devotion is exclusively for God. Those who have taken protectors other than Him, say: \"We worship them that they may bring us nearer to God.\" Surely God will judge between them in what they are differing about. Verily God does not show the way to an ungrateful liar.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Lo, religion is exclusively devoted to Allah. Your religion is entirely consecrated to Him. As for those who have taken others than Allah for their guardians, (they say): \u201cWe worship them only that they may bring us nearer to Allah.\u201d Allah will judge between them concerning what they differ about. Verily Allah does not guide anyone who is given to sheer lying, is an utter unbeliever.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "The religion of God is certainly pure. Concerning those whom they consider as their guardians besides God, they say, \"We only worship them so that they may make our positions nearer to God.\" God will certainly issue His decree about their differences. God does not guide the liars and the disbelievers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Pay heed! Worship is for Allah only; and those who have taken others as their supporters beside Him say; \u201cWe worship* them only so that they get us closer to Allah\u201d; Allah will surely judge between them regarding the matter in which they dispute; indeed Allah does not guide one who is a big liar, extremely ungrateful. (*The pagans regarded their idols as smaller Gods and worshipped them. So did the Christians. This does not apply to Muslims who only respect their elders, and ask for their blessings.)\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Surely, the religion is for Allah only. And those who take protectors besides Him (say): \"We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allah.\" Verily, Allah will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Truly, Allah guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "Now, surely, sincere obedience is due to Allah (alone) and (as for) those who take guardians besides Him, (saying), We do not serve them save that they may make us nearer to Allah, surely Allah will judge between them in that in which they differ; surely Allah does not guide him aright who is a liar, ungrateful.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "Belongs not sincere religion to God? And those who take protectors, apart from Him -- 'We only serve them that they may bring us nigh in nearness to God' -- surely God shall judge between them touching that whereon they are at variance. Surely God guides not him who is a liar, unthankful.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Surely pure religion is for Allah only. And those who choose protecting friends beside Him (say): We worship them only that they may bring us near unto Allah. Lo!

        "TRANSLATION_9": "it is to God alone that sincere obedience is due.

Verily Allah guideth not him who is a liar and ingrate.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "Indeed, only exclusive faith is worthy of Allah, and those who take other as awliya besides Him [claiming,] \u2018We only worship them so that they may bring us near to Allah,\u2019 Allah will judge between them concerning that about which they differ. Indeed Allah does not guide someone who is a liar and an ingrate.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "Is it not to Allah that sincere devotion is due? But those who take for protectors other than Allah (say): \"We only serve them in order that they may bring us nearer to Allah.\" Truly Allah will judge between them in that wherein they differ. But Allah guides not such as are false and ungrateful.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "Surely, the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allah only. And those who take Auliya' (protectors and helpers) besides Him (say): \"We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allah.\" Verily, Allah will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Truly, Allah guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "Is it not that the sincere religion belongs to Allah? As for those who choose guardians, other than Him, (saying): 'We only worship them so that they will bring us near to Allah' Indeed, Allah will judge between them concerning their differences. Indeed, Allah does not guide he who is an unthankful liar.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_16": "Unquestionably, for Allah is the pure religion. And those who take protectors besides Him [say], \"We only worship them that they may bring us nearer to Allah in position.\" Indeed, Allah will judge between them concerning that over which they differ. Indeed, Allah does not guide he who is a liar and [confirmed] disbeliever.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[39:3] Surely to God belongs pure religion, none other than Him being deserving of it. And those who take besides Him, the idols [as], patrons: and they are the disbelievers of Mecca \u2014 they say: \u2018We only worship them so that they may bring us near to God\u2019 (zulf\u0101, a verbal noun, with the sense of taqr\u012bban, \u2018for the sake of nearness\u2019). God will indeed judge between them, and the Muslims, concerning that about which they differ, of religion, and so admit the believers into Paradise, and the disbelievers into the Fire. Truly God does not guide one who is a liar, attributing a child to Him, a disbeliever, worshipping other than God.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Surely Pure religion is) sincerity in religion is enjoined upon people (for Allah only. And those who choose) and those who worship (protecting friends) deities: al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat (beside Him) beside Allah, i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca ((say): We worship them only that they may bring us near unto Allah) near to Allah in rank and intercession. (Lo! Allah will judge between them) and the believers on the Day of Judgement (concerning that wherein) in the matter of religion (they differ) they contravene. (Lo! Allah guideth not) to his religion (him who is a liar) about Allah, (an ingrate) and disbelieves in Allah; the reference here is to the Jews, Christians, the Banu Malih, the Magians and the Arab idolaters.\n"
