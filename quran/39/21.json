There are indeed lessons in this for those who are wise.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Do you not see that Allah sent down water from the sky, then made it flow on earth as springs and streams and rivers and then with it He brings forth vegetation of various hues; then this vegetation ripens and dries up, turning yellow, whereafter He reduces it to broken straw? Surely there is a lesson in this for those endowed with understanding.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Have you not seen that God has sent down water from the sky and made it flow as springs out of the earth?

        "TRANSLATION_7": "Hast thou not seen how that God has sent down out of heaven water and threaded it as springs in the earth, then He brings forth therewith crops of diverse hues, then they wither, and thou seest them turning yellow, then He makes them broken orts?

        "TRANSLATION_16": "Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky and makes it flow as springs [and rivers] in the earth; then He produces thereby crops of varying colors; then they dry and you see them turned yellow; then He makes them [scattered] debris. Indeed in that is a reminder for those of understanding.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[39:21] Have you not seen, realised, that God sends down water from the heaven, then conducts it as springs, making it enter points of springs, in the ground? Then with it He brings forth crops of diverse hues. Then they wither, they become dried-out, and you see them, for example, after having been green, turning yellow. Then He turns them into chaff. Truly in that there is a reminder for people of pith, possessors of intellect, by which they may be reminded, for it is an indication of God\u2019s Oneness and His power.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, Muhammad, in the Qur'an (how Allah hath sent down water) rain (from the sky and hath caused it to penetrate the earth as water springs) producing thereof rivers in the earth, (and afterward thereby produceth) through rain (crops of diverse hues; and afterward they wither) they change (and thou seest them turn yellow) after being green in colour; (then He maketh them chaff) dry chaff; such is the life of this world, it vanishes and never lasts. (Lo! Herein) in that which I mentioned concerning the vanishing of the life of this world (verily is a reminder) an admonition (for men of understanding) for those possessed of intellect among people.\n"
