(And We have appointed some of you a test) a trial (for others) We test the pure Arab with the client, and the noble by birth with the lowly and the rich with the poor; Allah said to Abu Jahl and his host: (Will ye be steadfast) with the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) Salman and his fellow believers, such that you become with them, in relation to Religion and other matters, equal and that you sit together with them? (And thy Lord is ever Seer) that they will not be steadfast regarding this.
