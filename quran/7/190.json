Samura [b. Jundub] reported that the Prophet (s) said, \u2018On one occasion when Eve gave birth \u2014 all the children she bore had failed to survive \u2014 Satan visited her and said [to her], \u201cName it [the child] \u2018Abd al-H\u0101rith, and it will live.\u201d She named it so and it lived. This [affair] was the result of Satan\u2019s inspiration and his doings\u2019: reported by al-H\u0101kim, who deemed it [the report] \u2018sound\u2019 (sah\u012bh), and [also reported] by al-Tirmidh\u012b, who considered it \u2018fair-uncommon\u2019 (hasan ghar\u012bb); but exalted is God above what they, the people of Mecca, associate, in the way of idols (this sentence is consequent, a supplement to [the one beginning with] khalaqakum, \u2018He created you\u2019, so that what comes between the two is a parenthetical statement).\n",
