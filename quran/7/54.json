Had He willed He could have created them in an instant; but the reason for His not having done so is that He wanted to teach His creatures to be circumspect; then presided upon the Throne, a presiding befitting of Him (al-\u2018arsh, \u2018throne\u2019, in the [classical] language is the elevated seat on which a king sits). He cloaks (read yughsh\u012b or yughashsh\u012b) the night with the day, that is, He covers each one with the other: each following the other in swift pursuit \u2014 and the sun and the moon and the stars (if all of these are read in the accusative, then they constitute a supplement to al-sam\u0101w\u0101t, \u2018the heavens\u2019, and if in the nominative, then they constitute the subject of the sentence, the predicate of which follows) have been made subservient, [have been] subdued, by His command, by His power. Verily, His is, all, creation and the command, in its entirety. Blessed, Magnified, be God, the Lord, the Master, of the Worlds!\n",

(He covereth the night with the day) and the day with the night, (which is in haste to follow it) i.e. the day is in haste to follow the night and the night is in haste to follow the day, (and hath made the sun and the moon and the stars subservient by His command) by His leave. (His verily is all creation) the creation of the heavens and the earth (and commandment) i.e. the judgement of people on the Day of Judgement (Blessed be Allah) the Possessor of grace; it is also said that this means: elevated is Allah; as it is said that this means: far exalted is Allah, (the Lord of the Worlds!) the Master and Disposer of the Worlds.\n"
