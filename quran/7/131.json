        "TRANSLATION_1": "Yet when good came their way they said: \"It is our due;\" but when misfortune befell them they put the omen down to Moses and those who were with him. But surely the omen was with God, yet most of them did not understand.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "But whenever prosperity came their way, they said: 'This is our due.' And whatever hardship befell them, they attributed it to the misfortune of Moses and those who followed him. Surely, their misfortune had been decreed by Allah - but most of them do not know that.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "But they would always ascribe their well-being to themselves and the misfortunes that they would experience to Moses and his people. Their fate is certainly in the hands of God but many of them do not know.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "So when good would reach them they would say, \u201cThis is for us\u201d; and when misfortune reached them, they would infer it as ill omens of Moosa and his companions; pay heed! The misfortune of their ill luck lies with Allah, but most of them are unaware.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "But whenever good came to them, they said: \"This is for us.\" And if evil afflicted them, they considered it an omen about Musa and those with him. Be informed! Verily, their omens are with Allah but most of them know not.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_10": "So whenever good-hap came unto them, they would say: ours is this. And if a mishap afflicted them, they would lay it to the evil augury of Musa and these with him. Behold! their evil augury was only with Allah, but most of them knew not.\n",

Allah said: (Surely their evil auspice) their hardship and abundance (was only with Allah. But most of them) all of them (knew not) this nor believed in it.\n"
