        "TRANSLATION_17": "[7:58] As for the good land, the one of rich soil, its vegetation comes forth, wholesomely, by permission of its Lord \u2014 this is a similitude of the believer who, when he hears an admonition, he [heeds it and] benefits from it. While as for the, one whose soil is, bad \u2014 the vegetation in, it comes forth only miserably, laboriously and with difficulty \u2014 this is the similitude of the disbeliever. Even, as We have made clear what has been mentioned, so We dispense, We make clear, the signs for a people who are thankful, to God and so believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(As for the good land) which is not a swamp, (its vegetation cometh forth by permission of its Lord) by the will of its Lord without toil or effort, just as the sincere believer fulfils that which Allah commands him to do voluntarily and with the good disposition of his soul; (while as for that which is bad) the bad, swampy land, (only the useless cometh forth (from it)) its vegetation comes forth only with toil and great effort. The hypocrite does not perform that which Allah commands him to do except when compelled and without a good disposition of the soul. (Thus do We recount the tokens) We expound the Qur'an by giving the simile of the believer and the disbeliever (for people who give thanks) for people who believe.\n"
