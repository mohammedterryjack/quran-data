        "TRANSLATION_0": "Say: 'My Lord has forbidden indecency, both open and hidden, and wrong action, and unrightful tyranny, and associating anything with Allah for which He has sent down no authority, and saying things about Allah you do not know.'",

Thus We detail the signs, We explain them in such detail, for a people who know\u2019, [who] reflect, for they are the ones to profit from these [signs].\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Say) Muhammad to the people of Mecca: (Who hath forbidden the adornment of Allah) the wearing of clothes during the days of pilgrimage, in the Sacred Precinct and upon circumambulation of the Ka'bah (which He hath brought forth) i.e. the adornment which He created (for His bondmen, and the good things of His providing?) of meat and fat, for in the pre-Islamic days they used to forbid themselves meat and fat during the days of pilgrimage, and entered the Sacred Precinct completely naked: the men during the day and the women during the night. Allah made these practices unlawful. (Say) Muhammad: (Such) the good things, (on the Day of Resurrection, will be only for those who believed during the life of the world) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, while both believer and sinner will enjoy them during the life of this world. (Thus do We detail Our revelations) We elucidate the Qur'an by explaining the lawful and the unlawful (for people who have knowledge) for people who believe it is from Allah.\n"
