        "TRANSLATION_14": "Ask them about the village that overlooked the sea and what befell (its people) when they broke the Sabbath.

Thus were We trying them for their wickedness. And when they went to fish, the city split into three: one third joined the fishing party, another prohibited them, while a third abstained from both fishing and prohibiting.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Ask them) the Jews, Muhammad (of the township) about the story of the township called Aylah (that was by the sea, how they did break the Sabbath) they used to transgress on the Sabbath by taking the fish, (how their big fish came unto them visibly) scores and scores of them, from deep inside up to the shore (upon their Sabbath day and on a day when they did not keep Sabbath came they not unto them. Thus did We try them) test them (for that they were evil-livers) transgressors.\n"
