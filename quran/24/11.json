        "TRANSLATION_17": "[24:11] Truly those who initiated the slander, the worst calumny against \u2018\u0100\u2019isha \u2014 mother of the believers, may God be pleased with her \u2014 accusing her [of fornication], are a band from among yourselves, a group from among the believers. She said [that these were] Hass\u0101n b. Th\u0101bit, \u2018Abd All\u0101h b. Ubayy, Mistah [b. Uth\u0101tha], and Hamna bt. Jahsh. Do not suppose, O you believers other than the [mentioned] band, that it is bad for you; rather it is good for you, for God will reward you for it and reveal \u2018\u0100\u2019isha\u2019s innocence and [the innocence of] the one who [is supposed to have] committed it with her, namely, Safw\u0101n [b. al-Mu\u2018attal]. She [\u2018\u0100\u2019isha] related: \u2018I accompanied the Prophet (s) during a raid, and this was after the [requirement to wear the] veil had been revealed. When he was through with it [the raid], he headed back [to the campsite] and one night, having drawn close to Medina, he announced that all should march off [home]. So I walked a distance [away from the campsite] and relieved myself. But when I came back to the campsite, [I realised that] my necklace (\u2018iqd meaning qil\u0101da) had snapped. So I went back to look for it. In the meantime they had strapped my litter\u2019 \u2014 in which one rides \u2014 \u2018thinking that I was inside, for in those days women were slight and ate very small portions (\u2018ulqa). [Finally] I found my necklace, but when I went back to where I had been staying overnight, they had already departed. I sat in the place where I had camped; I assumed that the group would notice my absence and come back for me. But my eyes were overcome [by   drowsiness] and I fell asleep. Safw\u0101n had pitched camp behind the army to rest for some of the night (\u2018arrasa), then set off while it was still night until he reached the site of the camp. He saw what looked like a person sleeping and recognised me when he [eventually] saw me, having seen me on numerous occasions before the [requirement of the] veil. I woke up to the sound of him saying, \u2018To God we belong and to Him we shall surely return\u2019 (inn\u0101 li\u2019Ll\u0101hi wa-inn\u0101 ilayhi r\u0101ji\u2018\u016bn), for he had recognised me. So I concealed my face with my gown (jilb\u0101b) \u2014 in other words, I covered it up with my wrap (mul\u0101\u2019a). By God he did not so much as say a word to me, nor did I hear him say anything other than the words, \u2018To God we belong and to Him we shall surely return\u2019, as he brought his camel to its knees and pressed with his foot against its foreleg [for me to mount it]. I then mounted it and he set off leading me back on the camel until we reached the army which had stopped because of the extreme midday heat; some had died [searching] for me. The one who bore the greater share of it [the sinful accusation] was \u2018Abd All\u0101h b. Ubayy b. Sal\u016bl\u2019 \u2026 her [\u2018\u0100\u2019isha\u2019s] words end here; this was reported by the two Shaykhs [al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim]. God, exalted be He, says: Upon every man of them shall be the [onus of the] sin which he has earned, in this [affair], and as for him who bore the greater share thereof, that is, [him who] assumed most of [the responsibility for] it, having initiated it and made it public, namely, \u2018Abd Allah b. Ubayy: there will be an awful chastisement for him, namely, the Fire in the Hereafter.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Lo! they who spread the slander) those who spread the lie (are a gang among you) this was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, the hypocrite, and Hassan Ibn Thabit al-Ansari, and Mistah Ibn Uthathah, the cousin of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, and 'Ubadah Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib and Hamnah Bint Jahsh al-Asadiyyah who slandered 'A'ishah and Safwan Ibn al-Mu'attal. (Deem it not) deem not the slandering of 'A'ishah and Safwan (a bad thing for you) in the Hereafter; (say, it is good for you) in terms of reward. (Unto every man of them) who engaged in slandering 'A'ishah and Safwan Ibn al-Mu'attal (will be paid that which he hath earned of the sin) in accordance to his engagement in the slander; (and as for him among them who had the greater share therein) the one who spread the matter and uttered abominable things concerning this matter, i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy (his will be an awful doom) in this worldly life by imposing the legal punishment on him and in the Hereafter by being cast in hell.\n"
