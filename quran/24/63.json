        "TRANSLATION_0": "Do not make your summoning of the Messenger the same as your summoning of one another. Allah knows those of you who sneak away. Those who oppose his command should beware of a testing trial coming to them or a painful punishment striking them.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Do not consider your being summoned by the Apostle to be like your summoning one another. God knows those of you who go away surreptitiously. So let those who act in contravention of his command take heed lest a trial should befall them or a grievous punishment come upon them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "O Believers, do not consider the summoning by the Messenger like the summoning among you by one another. Allah knows well those of you who steal away, concealing themselves behind others. Let those who disobey the order of the Messenger beware lest they should be involved in some affliction, or are visited by a woeful scourge.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Do not address the Messenger as you would call each other. God knows those who secretly walk away from you and hide themselves. Those who oppose the Messengers should beware, lest some trouble or a painful torment should befall them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Do not presume among yourselves the calling of the Noble Messenger equal to your calling one another; Allah knows those among you who sneak away by some pretext; so those who go against the orders of the Noble Messenger must fear that a calamity may strike them or a painful punishment befall them. (To honour the Holy Prophet \u2013 peace and blessings be upon him \u2013 is part of faith. To disrespect him is blasphemy.)\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Make not the calling of the Messenger among you as your calling one of another. Allah knows those of you who slip away under shelter.

        "TRANSLATION_6": "Do not hold the Apostle's calling (you) among you to be like your calling one to the other; Allah indeed knows those who steal away from among you, concealing themselves; therefore let those beware who go against his order lest a trial afflict them or there befall them a painful chastisement.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "Make not the calling of the Messenger among yourselves like your calling one of another. God knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously; so let those who go against His command beware, lest a trial befall them, or there befall them a painful chastisement.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Make not the calling of the messenger among you as your calling one of another. Allah knoweth those of you who steal away, hiding themselves. And let those who conspire to evade orders beware lest grief or painful punishment befall them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "Do not treat being called by the Messenger like being called by one another. God knows those of you who slip away on some pretext. Let those who go against his order beware lest some affliction befall them or they receive a painful punishment.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "Place not the apostle's calling among you on the same footing as your calling of each other. Of a surety Allah knoweth those who slip away privately; let therefore those who oppose His commandment beware lest there befall them a trial or there befall them a torment afflictive.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "Do not consider the Apostle\u2019s summons amongst you to be like your summoning one another. Allah certainly knows those of you who slip away shielding one another. Those who disobey his orders should beware lest an affliction should visit them or a painful punishment should befall them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "Deem not the summons of the Messenger among yourselves like the summons of one of you to another: Allah doth know those of you who slip away under shelter of some excuse: then let those beware who withstand the Messenger's order, lest some trial befall them, or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "Make not the calling of the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) among you as your calling of one another. Allah knows those of you who slip away under shelter (of some excuse without taking the permission to leave, from the Messenger SAW). And let those who oppose the Messenger's (Muhammad SAW) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "Do not make the calling of the Messenger among yourselves like your calling to one another. Allah knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously, so let those who disobey His command beware, lest they are struck by sedition, or, they are stricken with a painful punishment.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "Do not address the Messenger in the same manner you address one another. God knows those of you who slip away using flimsy excuses. So let those who oppose his orders beware, lest an ordeal strikes them, or a painful punishment befalls them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "Do not make [your] calling of the Messenger among yourselves as the call of one of you to another. Already Allah knows those of you who slip away, concealed by others. So let those beware who dissent from the Prophet's order, lest fitnah strike them or a painful punishment.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[24:63] Do not, among yourselves, consider the calling of the Messenger to be like your calling of one another, by saying, \u2018O Muhammad!\u2019 (s), but say, \u2018O Prophet of God\u2019, or, \u2018O Messenger of God!\u2019 gently, respectfully and in a low voice. Verily God knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously, that is, those who leave the mosque secretly during the sermon without asking leave, hiding behind something (qad, \u2018verily\u2019, is for confirmation). So let those who contravene His command, that is, God\u2019s command, or that of His Messenger, beware lest an ordeal, a trial, befall them, or there befall them a painful chastisement, in the Hereafter.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Make not the calling of the messenger among you) i.e. do not call the Prophet (pbuh) by his name saying: Muhammad, (as your calling one of another) by name. You should rather respect him, show deference towards him and honour him by saying: \"O Prophet of Allah\", \"0 Messenger of Allah\", \"0 Abu'l-Qasim\": (Allah knoweth those of you who steal away) from the mosque, (hiding themselves) the hypocrites used to leave the mosque without permission when no one could see them. (And let those who conspire to evade orders) the orders of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh); it is also said that this means: the orders of Allah (beware lest grief) a calamity (or painful punishment) beating (befall them.\n"
