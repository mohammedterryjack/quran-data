(No sin shall it be for you whether ye eat together) in moderation (or apart) and in this are included the blind, the lame, the sick and other categories of people. (But when ye enter houses) i.e. your houses or mosques and find no one there, (salute one another) say: \"peace be upon us from our Lord\" (with a greeting from Allah) as an honour from Allah to you, (blessed) with reward (and sweet) with forgiveness.
