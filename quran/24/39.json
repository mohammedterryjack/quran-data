[A mirage is] a kind of radiation which one might observe therein at midday during extreme heat, resembling running water \u2014 which the thirsty man supposes to be water until he comes to it and finds it to be nothing, like what he had supposed. Likewise is [the case of] the disbeliever who supposes that his deeds, such as some voluntary alms, will benefit him; but when he dies and comes before his Lord he will not find his deed, in other words, it will be of no benefit to him; and he finds God   there, namely, in the place of his deeds, Who pays him his account in full, that is, He requites him for it in this world; and God is swift at reckoning, that is, at requiting.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(As for those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, (their deeds) the similitude of their works in the Hereafter (are as a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one supposeth it to be water) from far (till he cometh unto it and flndeth it naught) he finds that it is not water; similarly, the disbeliever will not find any reward for his works in the Hereafter, (and finds, in the place thereof, Allah) and he finds with Allah the punishment for the sins he committed; it is also said that this means: and finds Allah ready to chastise him, (Who payeth him his due) Who inflict on him his punishment; (and Allah is swift at reckoning) Allah is severe in His punishment; it is also said that this means: when Allah takes people to task His reckoning is swift.\n"
