        "TRANSLATION_1": "That is how We have sent you to a people before whom many a people have come and gone, so that you may announce to them whatever We have revealed to you. But they do not believe in Ar-Rahman. Tell them: \"He is my Lord. There is no other god but He. In Him have I placed my trust, and to Him is my reversion.\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Thus have We sent you as a Messenger to a community before which many other communities have passed away that you may recite to them whatever We have revealed to you. And yet they deny the Lord of Mercy. Say to them: \"He is my Lord, there is no god but Him. In Him I have placed all my trust and to Him I shall return.\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "We have sent you to a nation before whom there lived many nations so that you would read to them what We have revealed to you. They still deny the existence of the Beneficent God. Say, \"He is my Lord besides whom there is no other God. I trust Him and turn to Him in repentance.\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Similarly We sent you (O dear Prophet Mohammed \u2013 peace and blessings be upon him) towards the nation, before whom other nations have passed away, for you to recite to them the divine revelations We sent down to you, whereas they are denying the Most Gracious; proclaim, \u201cHe is my Lord \u2013 there is no worship except for Him; I rely only upon Him and only towards Him is my return.\u201d\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Thus have We sent you to a community before whom other communities have passed away, in order that you might recite unto them what We have revealed to you, while they disbelieve in the Most Gracious (Allah).

        "TRANSLATION_8": "Thus We send thee (O Muhammad) unto a nation, before whom other nations have passed away, that thou mayst recite unto them that which We have inspired in thee, while they are disbelievers in the Beneficent.

La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He)! In Him is my trust, and to Him will be my return with repentance.\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "As such, We have sent you forth to a nation before whom others have passed away in order that you recite to them what We have revealed to you.

In Him I trust and to Him is my recourse\u2019.\n",

(Say) the Beneficent: (He is my Lord; there is no God save Him. In Him do I put my trust) I trust in and rely on Him (and unto Him is my recourse) to Him is the return in the Hereafter.\n"
