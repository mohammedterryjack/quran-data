Or are you announcing to God what He does not know on the earth? Or is it only empty talk? In fact, the unbelievers' plots are made to look attractive to them, so that they are held back from the right path. Whosoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way.\n",

Tell them: \"Name those associates (if Allah Himself has made them His associates)! Or are you informing Allah of something the existence of which He does not even know?\" Or do people arbitrarily utter empty words? Indeed, their foul contriving has been made to seem fair to the unbelievers and they have been barred from finding the Right Way. Whomsoever Allah lets go astray will have none to guide him.\n",

Yet, the unbelievers have considered their idols equal to God. Say, \"Name the attributes of your idols. Are you trying to tell God about something that does not exist on the earth? Do you only mention empty names? Evil plans have attracted the unbelievers and have misled them from the right path. No one can guide those whom God has caused to go astray.\n",

Or will you inform Him, will you inform God, of something, that is, of an associate, which He does not know in the earth?

(Is it that ye would inform Him) are you going to inform Him (of something which He knoweth not) to exist (in the earth) which benefits or harms beside Allah? (Or is it but a way of speaking) or is it just out of false talk, false testimony and lying that they do worship them? (Nay, but their contrivance) their speech and deeds (is made seeming fair for those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and they are kept from the right road) they were sent astray from Religion.
