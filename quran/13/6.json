        "TRANSLATION_2": "They challenge you to hasten the coming of evil upon them before the coming of any good, although people who followed a like course before had met with exemplary punishment (from Allah). Verily your Lord is forgiving to mankind despite all their wrong-doing. Verily your Lord is also severe in retribution.\n",

But lo! thy Lord is rich in pardon for mankind) the people of Mecca (despite their wrong) despite their idolatry, that is if they repent and believe, (and lo! thy Lord is strong in punishment!) for those who do not repent of idolatry.\n"
