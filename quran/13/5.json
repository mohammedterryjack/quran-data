        "TRANSLATION_1": "If you are surprised, then astonishing is the speech (of those who say:) \"Having turned to dust shall we be raised as a new creation?\" They are the ones who deny their Lord, and they will have collars around their necks. They are the inmates of Hell, where they will abide for ever.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "And were you to wonder, then wondrous indeed is the saying of those who say: \"What! After we have been reduced to dust, shall we be created afresh?\" They are the ones who disbelieved in their Lord; they are the ones who shall have shackles around their necks.

Those are the ones who disbelieve in their Lord; those \u2014 fetters shall be around their necks; and those, they shall be the inhabitants of the Fire, abiding therein.\n",

(Such) those who deny the Resurrection (are they who disbelieve in their Lord; such) the disbelieving folk (have carcans on their necks) they have chains on their hands tied up to their necks; (such) those who are chained (are rightful owners of the Fire) the dwellers of hell, (they will abide therein) they will dwell therein, never to die or come out of it.\n"
