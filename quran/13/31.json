        "TRANSLATION_0": "Even if there was a Qur'an which moved mountains, or split the earth open or spoke to the dead . . .! On the contrary! The affair is Allah's altogether. Do those who have iman not know that if Allah had wanted to He could have guided all mankind? Those who are kafir will not cease to be struck by disaster for what they have done - or a disaster will happen close to their homes - until Allah's promise is fulfilled. Allah will not fail to keep His promise.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "Had there been a Qur'an which could have made the mountains move, or the earth to cleave asunder, or the dead to speak, yet all authority belongs to God. Have the believers not learnt that if God had so willed He could have guided all mankind? As for unbelievers, they will be visited by misfortune endlessly for what they have done; or it would sit in their homes till the promised threat of God comes to pass. Surely God does not go back on His promise.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "And what would have happened were a Qur'an to be revealed wherewith mountains could be set in motion, or the earth cleft, or the dead made to speak? (To show such signs is not at all difficult for) everything rests entirely with Allah. So, do not the people of faith (still look forward to such a sign in response to the demand of the unbelievers and) despair as a result of knowing that had Allah so willed, He could have guided all to the Truth. Misfortune continues to afflict the unbelievers on account of their misdeeds, or to befall on locations close to their habitation. This will continue until Allah's promise (of chastisement) is fulfilled. Indeed Allah does not go back upon His promise.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Even if the Quran would make mountains move, cut the earth into pieces and make the dead able to speak, (the unbelievers still would not believe). All affairs are in the hands of God. Do the believers still hope that they will believe? Had God wanted he could have guided the whole of mankind to the right path. The unbelievers will always suffer afflictions that result from their deeds or the affliction which occur near their homes, until God's promise of punishing them will be fulfilled. God does not disregard His promise.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "And were such a Qur\u2019an to come that would cause the mountains to move, or the earth to split asunder, or the dead to speak, even then these disbelievers would not believe; in fact, all matters are only at Allah\u2019s discretion; so have not the Muslims despaired in that, had Allah willed, He would have guided all mankind? Disasters shall continue to strike the disbelievers on account of their deeds, or descend near their homes until Allah\u2019s promise comes; indeed Allah does not break the promise.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "And if there had been a Qur'an with which mountains could be moved (from their places), or the earth could be cloven asunder, or the dead could be made to speak (it would not have been other than this Qur'an). But the decision of all things is certainly with Allah. Have not then those who believed yet known that had Allah willed, He could have guided all mankind And a disaster will not cease to strike those who disbelieved because of their (evil) deeds or it (i.e. the disaster) settles close to their homes, until the promise of Allah comes to pass.

The faithless will continue to be visited by catastrophes because of their doings\u2014or they will land near their habitations\u2014until Allah\u2019s promise comes to pass.

In fact, every decision rests with God. Did the believers not give up and realize that had God willed, He would have guided all humanity? Disasters will continue to strike those who disbelieve, because of their deeds, or they fall near their homes, until God\u2019s promise comes true. God never breaks a promise.\n",

Then have those who believed not accepted that had Allah willed, He would have guided the people, all of them?

        "TRANSLATION_17": "[13:31] The following was revealed when they said to him, \u2018If you are [truly] a prophet, then make these mountains of Mecca drift away before us, and make for us rivers and springs in it, that we may plant and sow seeds, and resurrect for us our dead fathers to speak to us and tell us that you are a prophet\u2019: Even if it were a   Qur\u2019\u0101n whereby the mountains were set in motion, moved from their places, or the earth were cleft, torn, or the dead were spoken to, such that they would respond, they still would not believe. Nay, but the affair belongs entirely to God, and none other, so that none believes except he whom He wills that he believes, and no other; even if they were given what they request [of signs]. The following was revealed when the Companions were keen that what was requested [of signs] should be manifested, hoping that they [the ones requesting them] might believe: Have they not realised, those who believe, that (an is softened, in other words [understand it as] annahu) had God willed, He could have guided all mankind?, to faith, without [the need for] any sign? And the disbelievers, from among the people of Mecca, continue to be struck by devastation, a catastrophe that devastates them through all manner of hardship, such as being killed, taken captive, and [suffering] war or drought, because of what they wrought, because of their actions, that is, their disbelief; or you alight, O Muhammad (s), together with your army, near their home \u2014 Mecca \u2014 until God\u2019s promise, of victory against them, comes to pass; truly God does not break His promise: and indeed, he alighted at Hudaybiyya until the conquest of Mecca took place;\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "Then the following was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Umayyah al-Makhzumi and his companions who said to the Prophet: make the mountains disappear by means of your Qur'an; or make springs gush out of them, just as David did with the fount of copper, as you claim; or bring for us a wind by means of which we travel to Historic Syria and return, just as it was done by Solomon, according to you; or bring our dead to life as did Jesus, as you claim. So Allah said: (Had it been possible for a Lecture) other than the Qur'an which has been revealed to Muhammad (pbuh) (to cause the mountains to move) by means of which mountains are made to disappear from the face of the earth, (or the earth to be torn asunder) by means of which to travel long distances, (or the dead to speak) or by means of which the dead are brought back to life, the Qur'an which was revealed to Muhammad (pbuh) would have done so. (Nay, but Allah's is the whole command) rather, Allah can do all these things, if He wills. (Do not those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (know that had Allah willed, He could have guided all mankind)?) if he willed, He would have honoured all mankind with His religion (As for those who disbelieve) in the Scriptures and messengers, i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca, (disaster) a military detachment; and it is said this means: a thunderbolt (ceaseth not to strike them because of what they do) in their state of disbelief, (or it dwelleth near) or make camp with your Companions near (their home) near their city Mecca, in 'Usfan (until the threat of Allah) the Conquest of Mecca (come to pass. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep the tryst) i.e. the Conquest of Mecca; as it is said this means: resurrection after death.\n"
