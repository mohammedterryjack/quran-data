And nor is their plotting like the plotting of God, for, exalted be He, He knows what every soul earns, and so its requital is prepared for it, and this is the ultimate plotting, since He brings it to them whence they are not aware. The disbeliever (the genus is meant here; a variant reading has kuff\u0101r [\u2018the disbelievers\u2019]) shall assuredly know for whom shall be the sequel of the [heavenly] Abode, that is, the praiseworthy sequel in the abode of the Hereafter: will it be theirs or that of the Prophet (s) and his Companions?\n",

(He) Allah (knows that which each soul) whether believing or unbelieving (earneth) of good or evil. (The disbelievers) the Jews and all the disbelievers (will come to know for whom will be the sequel of the (heavenly) Home) i.e. Paradise; it is also said that this means: the disbelievers will come to know for whom is the upper hand on the Day of Badr and to whom Mecca will belong.\n"
