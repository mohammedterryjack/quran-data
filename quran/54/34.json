So was the squall unleashed at first with the family of Lot [still there]? There are two opinions regarding this: in the case of the former [that it was unleashed upon them including the family of Lot] the exception is understood as a continuous one, while in the case of the latter [opinion that they were delivered before the squall] the exception is understood as a discontinuous one, even if it [\u2018the family of Lot\u2019] is actually subsumed by the collective noun [\u2018the people of Lot\u2019, and so they were delivered] as a kindness [from God];\n",
