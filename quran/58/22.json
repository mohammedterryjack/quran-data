(As for such) Hatib and his fellow believers, (He hath written faith upon their hearts) He cast love of faith in their hearts (and hath strengthened them with a Spirit from Him) with a mercy from Him; and it is said this means: He helped them with a help from Him, (and He will bring them into Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers flow) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk flow, (wherein they will abide) they will dwell in Paradise for eternity, never to die or leave it. (Allah is well pleased with them) because of their faith, works and repentance, (and they are well pleased with Him) 656 because of the reward and honour they receive from Him. (They are Allah's party) they are Allah's army. (Lo! is it not Allah's party who are the successful?) they are saved from His wrath and chastisement; these are the ones who found and obtained what they were seeking, and were saved from the evil of that which they fled from. Hatib was of those who took part in the Battle of Badr, and his story is found in surah \"She that is to be examined (al-Mumtahanah)\". And of the surah in which Exile is mentioned which is all Medinan, and consists of 24 verses, 745 words and 1,712 letters: Surah 59: Exile (al-Hashr) And of the surah in which Exile is mentioned which is all Medinan, and consists of 24 verses, 745 words and 1,712 letters:\n"
