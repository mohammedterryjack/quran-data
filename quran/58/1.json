She asked the Prophet (s) about this and he told her that she was [thenceforth] forbidden to him, as was customary among them [at the time of J\u0101hiliyya], namely, that repudiation by zih\u0101r results in permanent separation. She was Khawla bt. Tha\u2018laba and he was Aws b. alS\u0101mit \u2014 and complains to God, of her being alone and of her impoverishment while having young children, whom if she were to leave with him, they would go astray, but whom, if they remained with her, would go hungry. And God hears your conversation, your consulting. Assuredly God is Hearer, Seer, [He is] Knower.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said concerning the interpretation of Allah's 652 saying (Allah hath heard): '(Allah hath heard) He says: Allah heard before He informed you, Muhammad, (the saying of her that disputeth) that speaks to and argues (with thee (Muhammad) concerning her husband, and complaineth unto Allah) and entreats Allah, Exalted is He, to explain her matter. (And Allah heareth your colloquy) and Allah hears your conversation and exchange of words. (Lo! Allah is Hearer) of your conversation, (Knower) of her matter. The story is that Khawlah Bint Tha'labah Ibn Malik Ibn al- Dakhshim al-Ansariyyah was married to Aws Ibn al-Samit al-Ansari and the latter, who was touched by the jinn, wanted to have sexual intercourse with her while in her period. When she refused, he became angry and said: \"if you leave the house before I have sexual intercourse with you, you are unlawful to me just as my mother is\".\n"
