What happened is that the hypocrites used to hold secret conferences with the Jews regarding the military expeditions of the believers, in order to aggrieve the believers. (And when they) i.e. the Jews (come unto thee they greet thee with a greeting wherewith Allah greeteth thee not) for they used to say al-sam, i.e. death, be with you [that is instead of saying al-salam, i.e. peace, be with you] and the Prophet (pbuh) used to answer: \"and al-sam be with you\", (and say within themselves) to one another: (Why should Allah punish us for what we say) to His Prophet? If he were truly a Prophet, as he claims, his prayer would have been answered when he answers: \"and al-sam be with you\".
