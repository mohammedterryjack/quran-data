        "TRANSLATION_8": "And among mankind is he who worshippeth Allah upon a narrow marge so that if good befalleth him he is content therewith, but if a trial befalleth him, he falleth away utterly. He loseth both the world and the Hereafter. That is the sheer loss.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_9": "There are some who worship God half-heartedly, then, if some good befalls them, they are content with it, but if an ordeal befalls them, they revert to their former ways. They lose in this world as well in the Hereafter. That is a clear loss.\n",

That is the manifest loss.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And among mankind is he who worshippeth Allah upon a narrow marge) and among people there is he who worships Allah on an experimental basis, in doubt and because of expectation of some benefit. This was revealed about the Banu'l-Hallaf, the hypocrites of the Banu Asad and Ghatafan, (so that if good) a bounty (befalleth him he is content therewith) he is pleased with the religion of Muhammad (pbuh) but just with his tongue, (but if a trial) hardship (befalleth him, he falleth away utterly) he reverts to his first religion: associating partners with Allah. (He loseth both the world) by missing the life of this world (and the Hereafter) by losing Paradise. (That is the sheer loss) the loss of both this worldly life and the Hereafter.\n"
