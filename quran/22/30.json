The exceptive clause [above] is a discontinuous one; but it could also be [taken as] continuous, so that the prohibition is of that which has died and so on. So avoid the abomination of idols (mina\u2019l-awth\u0101n: min here is explicative [as opposed to partitive], in other words, \u2018[avoid abomination], namely, idols\u2019), and avoid false speech, that is to say, ascribing partners to God in your [uttering of the] talbiya, or [avoid] bearing false witness;\n",

(And whoso magnifieth the sacred things of Allah) i.e. the rites of the pilgrimage, (it will be well for him in the sight of his Lord) in terms of reward. (The cattle) the immolated cattle and the eating of their meat (are lawful unto you save that which has been told you) in Surah al-Ma'idah such as carrion, blood and pork. (So shun the filth of idols) so leave the drinking of intoxicants and the worship of idols, (and shun lying speech) and abstain from uttering falsehood and lies. This is because they used to say during their pilgrimage in the pre-Islamic time: \"here we are, Lord, here we are, you have no partners except for a partner that you possess and it possesses not\", and so Allah forbade them from saying this.\n"
