The Prophet (s) had, during an assembly of the [men of] Quraysh, after reciting the [following verses from] s\u016brat al-Najm, Have you considered L\u0101t and \u2018Uzz\u0101? And Man\u0101t, the third one? [53:19-20] added, as a result of Satan casting them onto his tongue without his [the Prophet\u2019s] being aware of it, [the following words]: \u2018those are the high-flying cranes (alghar\u0101n\u012bq al-\u2018ul\u0101) and indeed their intercession is to be hoped for\u2019, and so they [the men of Quraysh] were thereby delighted. Gabriel, however, later informed him [the Prophet] of this that Satan had cast onto his tongue and he was grieved by it; but was [subsequently] comforted with this following verse that he might be reassured [of God\u2019s pleasure]: thereat God abrogates, nullifies, whatever Satan had cast, then God confirms His revelations. And God is Knower, of Satan\u2019s casting of that which has been mentioned, Wise, in His enabling him [Satan] to do such things, for He does whatever He will.\n",

(But Allah abolisheth) but Allah elucidates (that which Satan proposeth) on the tongue of His Prophet such that he does not act upon it. (Then Allah establisheth) then He clarifies (His revelations) for His Prophet in order that he acts upon them. (Allah is Knower) of that which Satan proposes, (Wise) He decrees to abolish it;\n"
