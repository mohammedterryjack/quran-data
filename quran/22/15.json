Then let him see whether his strategy, against the Prophet being helped, dispels that which enrages him, about it. In other words, let him choke to death with rage because of it, for it is inevitable.\n",

Then let him see) let him reflect upon (whether his strategy) hanging himself (dispelleth that whereat he rageth!) i.e. regarding Muhammad (pbuh). It is also said that there is another way of understanding this passage: whoever thinks that Allah will not help him in this worldly life with sustenance and in the Hereafter with reward, then let him tie a rope to the roof of his house, hang himself with it and see whether killing himself will dispel his rage regarding sustenance.\n"
