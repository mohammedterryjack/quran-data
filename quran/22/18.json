And for many the chastisement has become due, and these are the disbelievers, for they refuse to prostrate, [an action] which is contingent on belief. And he whom God abases, [he whom] He makes unprosperous, there is none to give him honour, [none] to make him fortunate. Indeed God does whatever He will, in the way of abasing or giving honour.\n",

(He whom Allah scorneth) he whom Allah abases through damnation, (there is none to give him honour) through felicity; it is also said that this means: he whom Allah abases by means of ignorance, there is none to give him honour through knowledge. (Lo! Allah doeth what He will) with His created beings; He gives felicity and damnation, knowledge and ignorance.\n"
