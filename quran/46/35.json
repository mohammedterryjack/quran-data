        "TRANSLATION_0": "So be steadfast as the Messengers with firm resolve were also steadfast. And do not seek to hasten it for them. On the Day they see what they were promised, it will be as if they had only tarried for just one hour of a single day. It has been transmitted! Will any be destroyed except for deviant people?",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "So bear with patience, as the apostles who were constant, bore; and do not be hasty (in demanding punishment) for them. On the day they see what they had been foretold, (they will realise) that they did not stay in the world but only an hour of the day. This is the message to be conveyed: Shall any perish but the ungodly?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "So bear with patience, (O Prophet), even as the Messengers endowed with firmness of resolve (before you) bore with patience, and do not be hasty in their regard. The Day when they see what they had been warned against they will feel as though they had remained in the world no more than an hour of a day. (The Truth has been conveyed.) Will any, then, suffer perdition except those who disobey?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "(Muhammad), exercise patience as did the steadfast Messengers. Do not try to make them suffer the torment immediately; on the day when they will see the torment with which they were threatened, they will think that they had lived no more than an hour. The message has been delivered. No one else will be destroyed except the evil doing people.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "Therefore patiently endure (O dear Prophet Mohammed \u2013 peace and blessings be upon him) like the courageous Noble Messengers had endured, and do not be impatient for them; on the day when they see what they are promised, it will be as if they had not stayed on earth except part of a day; this is to be conveyed; will anyone be destroyed, except the disobedient?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Therefore be patient as did those of determination among the Messengers and be in no hurry for them. On the Day when they will see what they are promised, it will be as though they had not remained (in the world) except an hour in a day. (This is) a clear Message. But will any be destroyed except the defiantly rebellious people\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "Therefore bear up patiently as did the apostles endowed with constancy bear up with patience and do not seek to hasten for them (their doom). On the day that they shall see what they are promised they shall be as if they had not tarried save an hour of the day. A sufficient exposition! Shall then any be destroyed save the transgressing people?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "So be thou patient, as the Messengers possessed of constancy were also patient. Seek not to hasten it for them -- it shall be as if on the day they see that they are promised, they had not tarried but for an hour of a single day. A Message to be delivered! And shall any be destroyed but the people of the ungodly?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "Then have patience (O Muhammad) even as the stout of heart among the messengers (of old) had patience, and seek not to hasten on (the doom) for them.

        "TRANSLATION_9": "Have patience, then, as had the steadfast Messengers before you; and be in no haste about them. On the Day when they see what they are threatened with, it will appear to them as though they had not tarried longer than an hour of a day. [Your responsibility is] to deliver the message: and none but the disobedient shall be destroyed.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "Bear thou then with patience even as the apostles, endued with resolution bear with patience, and seek not to hasten on for them. On the Day whereon they will behold that wherewith they are threatened, it will seem to them as though they had tarried but an hour of the day. A proclamation this: so none will be destroyed save the nation of transgressors.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "So be patient just as the resolute among the apostles were patient, and do not seek to hasten [the punishment] for them. The day when they see what they are promised, [it will be] as though they had remained [in the world] only an hour of a day. This is a proclamation. So shall anyone be destroyed except the transgressing lot?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "Therefore patiently persevere, as did (all) messengers of inflexible purpose; and be in no haste about the (Unbelievers). On the Day that they see the (Punishment) promised them, (it will be) as if they had not tarried more than an hour in a single day. (Thine but) to proclaim the Message: but shall any be destroyed except those who transgress?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "Therefore be patient (O Muhammad SAW) as did the Messengers of strong will and be in no haste about them (disbelievers). On the Day when they will see that (torment) with which they are promised (i.e. threatened, it will be) as if they had not stayed more than an hour in a single day. (O mankind! This Quran is sufficient as) a clear Message (or proclamation to save yourself from destruction). But shall any be destroyed except the people who are Al-Fasiqun (the rebellious, disobedient to Allah).\n",
        "TRANSLATION_14": "Be patient, as the Messengers of might were patient, and do not hasten it for them. On the Day when they see what they have been promised, it will be as if they did not stay except an hour of a day. (This Koran is) a Conveyance! Shall any be destroyed except the nation of evildoers?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_15": "So be patient, as the messengers with resolve were patient, and do not be hasty regarding them. On the Day when they witness what they are promised, it will seem as if they had lasted only for an hour of a day. A proclamation: Will any be destroyed except the sinful people?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "So be patient, [O Muhammad], as were those of determination among the messengers and do not be impatient for them. It will be - on the Day they see that which they are promised - as though they had not remained [in the world] except an hour of a day. [This is] notification. And will [any] be destroyed except the defiantly disobedient people?\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[46:35] So endure [with patience], the harm done [to you] by your people, just as the resolute, those of constancy and [power of] endurance during hardships, from among the messengers endured [with patience], before you, so that you may be one of resolve [like them] (min [of mina\u2019l-rusuli] is explicative, as all of them were men of resolve; but some say that this [particle min] is [actually] meant to be partitive, since excluded from their number are: Adam, on the basis of God\u2019s saying, exalted be He: And We did not find in him any constancy [Q. 20:115]; and Jonah, on the basis of His words: And do not be like the One of the fish [Q. 68:48]). And do not seek to hasten [it] for them, for your people, the sending down of the chastisement on them. Some say that he [the Prophet] seemed [by this stage] to have become exasperated because of them and desired that chastisement be sent down on them, which is why he was enjoined to [exercise] patience and to refrain from hastening the chastisement [for them] \u2014 for it would befall them [eventually] without   doubt. It shall seem for them, on the day when they see what they are promised, of chastisement in the Hereafter, given its long duration, as though they had tarried, in this world, by their reckoning, only an hour of a day. This Qur\u2019\u0101n is, a communication, a proclamation from God to you. So shall any be destroyed, that is to say, none [shall be destroyed] upon seeing the chastisement, but the immoral folk?, that is to say, the disbelieving [folk]. Medinese, except for verse 13, or [it is all] Meccan; it consists of 38 or 39 verses.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Then have patience) Muhammad in the face of the disbelievers' harm (even as the stout of heart) as those possessed of certainty and resolve (among the messengers (of old)) such as Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus; it is also said that this means: such as those possessed of toughness and patience like Noah, Job, Zachariah and John (had patience, and seek not to hasten on the doom for them. On the day when they see that which they are promised) of doom ((it will seem to them) as though they had tarried) in the life of the world (but an hour of daylight. A clear message). And when the time of chastisement and destruction comes, (Shall any be destroyed) through such a chastisement (save evil-living folk) save the disbelievers, those who had denied and barred people from the way of Allah?' And of the surah in which Muhammad is mentioned which is all Meccan and was revealed about fighting: Surah 47: Muhammad And of the surah in which Muhammad is mentioned which is all Meccan and was revealed about fighting:\n"
