So the Prophet (pbuh) said: \"I do not know what will be done with me or with you; nor whether we should migrate from Mecca or not\". (I do but follow) act upon (that which is inspired in me) that which I am commanded in the Qur'an, (and I am but a plain warner) a warning messenger who addresses you in a language that you understand.\n"
