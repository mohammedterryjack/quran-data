So are free women from among the muminun and free women of those given the Book before you, once you have given them their dowries in marriage, not in fornication or taking them as lovers. But as for anyone who rejects iman, his actions will come to nothing and in the Next World he will be among the losers.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "On this day all things that are clean have been made lawful for you; and made lawful for you is the food of the people of the Book, as your food is made lawful for them. And lawful are the chaste Muslim women, and the women of the people of the Book who are chaste, (for marriage) and not fornication or liaison, if you give them their dowries. Useless shall be rendered the acts of those who turn back on their faith, and they will be among the losers in the life to come.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "This day all good things have been made lawful to you. The food of the People of the Book is permitted to you, and your food is permitted to them. And permitted to you are chaste women, be they either from among the believers or from among those who have received the Book before you, provided you become their protectors in wedlock after paying them their bridal-due, rather than go around committing fornication and taking them as secret-companions. The work of he who refuses to follow the way of faith will go waste, and he will be among the utter losers in the Hereafter.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "On this day, all pure things are made lawful for you (as food). The food of the People of the Book is made lawful for you and your food is made lawful for them. It is lawful for you to marry chaste Muslim women and chaste women of the People of the Book, provided, you pay their dowry, maintain chastity, and avoid fornication or lustful relations outside of marriage.

And whosoever disbelieves in the Oneness of Allah and in all the other Articles of Faith [i.e. His (Allah's), Angels, His Holy Books, His Messengers, the Day of Resurrection and Al-Qadar (Divine Preordainments)], then fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.\n",

Likewise, the believing, free, married women, and the married women of those who were given the Scripture before you, are permitted to you for marriage, if you give them their wages, their dowries, in wedlock, in marriage, and not illicitly, fornicating overtly with them, or taking them as lovers, so as to fornicate with them secretly. Whoever disbelieves in faith, that is, [whose] apostatises, his, prior good, work has indeed failed, and so it counts for nothing and he will not be rewarded for it, and in the Hereafter he shall be among the losers, if he dies in this state [of unbelief]. 2848851345\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(This day) the day of the pilgrimage (are (all) good things) that which has been immolated (made lawful for you. The food) the animals immolated (of those who have received the Scripture is lawful for you) as long as it is not prohibited, (and your food) your immolated animals (is lawful for them) both the Jews and Christians can consume that which the Muslims immolate. (And so are the) free (virtuous women of the believers) are lawful for you to marry (and the virtuous women of those who received the Scripture before you) lawful for you to marry (when ye give them their marriage portions) their dowry, in surplus of the price given to the prostitute in exchange for sex (and live with them in honour) in wedlock, (not in) flagrant (fornication, nor taking them as secret concubines.) This was revealed about the women of Mecca when they boasted to the women of Medina. Allah said: (Whoso denieth the faith) Allah's divine Oneness, (his work is vain) in this world (and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter) he will be of those who have been duped since he will be deprived of Paradise and enter hell.\n"
