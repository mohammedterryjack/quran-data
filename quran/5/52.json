God, exalted be He, says: But it may be that God will bring victory, by assisting His Prophet and making His religion prevail; or some commandment from Him, that will reveal the secrets of the hypocrites, disgracing them; and then they will end up, for what they kept secret within themselves, in the way of doubt and affiliating with disbelievers, remorseful.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And thou) Muhammad (seest those in whose heart is a disease) doubt and hypocrisy, i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn 119 Ubayy and his followers (race towards them) race to take them as friends, (saying) to one another: (We fear lest a change of fortune befall us) we fear hardship may befall us, this is why we take them as friends. (And it may) \"may ['asa]\" when used in connection with Allah denotes a requisite (happen that Allah will vouchsafe (unto you) the victory) the Conquest of Mecca and victory to Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions (or a commandment from His presence) or a punishment inflicted on the Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir, by means of killing and expelling them. (Then will they) i.e. the hypocrites (repent) after being exposed (of their secret thoughts) of their alliance with Jews.\n"
