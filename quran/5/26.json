It is reported that they would travel throughout the night earnestly, but in the morning would find themselves back where they had started. And they would travel all day, with the same result, until they all perished, except those under twenty years of age. It is said that they numbered 600,000. Moses and Aaron died in the wilderness, and this was a mercy for them, and a chastisement for those others. When Moses was on the verge of death, he asked his Lord to bring him close to the Holy Land, to within a stone\u2019s throw, and He did, as related in had\u012bth. Joshua became a prophet sometime after his fortieth year and he was commanded to fight against the giants. So he sallied forth with those that remained by his side and he fought against them; it was a Friday and the sun stopped for him for an hour, until he had finished with fighting them. Ahmad [b. Hanbal] reported in his Musnad the [following] had\u012bth, \u2018The sun was never detained for any human, except for Joshua during those days in which he marched towards the Holy House [of Jerusalem]\u2019.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "((Their Lord) said) to Moses: (For this the land will surely be forbidden them) i.e. to enter it, after you called them wrong-doing folk (for forty years that they will wander in the earth, bewildered) they will be bewildered in the wilderness, confined in an area of seven parasangs, unable to get out of it or be guided to the right way. (So grieve not over) do not be saddened about (the wrong-doing folk).\n"
