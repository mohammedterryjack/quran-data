Say: \u2018The good, delicious, things are made lawful for you; and the, quarry of, hunting creatures, dogs, wildcats or birds that catch food, you have taught, training [them] as hounds (mukallib\u012bn is a circumstantial qualifier, derived from kallabtu al-kalba, meaning, \u2018I released the hound against the quarry\u2019) teaching them (tu\u2018allim\u016bnahunna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of mukallib\u012bn, \u2018training [them] as hounds\u2019, in other words, \u2018disciplining them\u2019) of what God has taught you, of the art of hunting; so eat what they have caught for you, even if they have killed it, as long as they have not eaten any of it. This is in contrast to the untrained [hunting creatures], whose catch is not lawful [for consumption]: the mark of these [being trained hunting creatures] is that they should return after they have been sent out, that they can be curbed when cried at and that they can seize the quarry without eating of it; the minimum number of times by which this may be known is three. If they eat any of it, then it cannot be counted as \u2018what they have caught\u2019 for their trainers, and is consequently unlawful for consumption, as reported in had\u012bth in both of the Sah\u012bhs [of Bukh\u0101r\u012b and Muslim] \u2014 therein it is also mentioned that a catch made by an arrow over which God\u2019s name is mentioned is equivalent [in lawfulness] to the catch of trained hunting creatures. And mention God\u2019s name over it, when you unleash it. And fear God. Indeed, God is swift at the reckoning\u2019.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(They ask thee) Muhammad; the people who so asked were Zayd Ibn Muhalhil al-Ta'i and 'Adiyy Ibn Hatim al-Ta'i, both fishermen (what is made lawful for them) of game. (Say : (all) good things) all the immolated ones (are made lawful for you. And those beasts and birds of prey which ye have trained as ill hounds are trained, ye teach them) to abstain from eating game (that which Allah taught you) as Allah has taught you; (so eat of that which they) the trained dogs (catch for you and mention Allah's name upon it) upon immolating your game; and it is also said: upon sending the trained dogs upon the game, (and observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah about eating the meat of carrion. (Lo! Allah is swift to take account) His punishment is severe; it is also said that this means: when He is swift when He takes people to task.\n"
