If they come to you, to judge between them, then judge between them or turn away from them: the [second] option given here was abrogated by His saying, So judge between them [to the end of] the verse [Q. 5:48]. Therefore, we [Muslims] are obliged to judge between them if they request arbitration before us \u2014 and this is the more sound of al-Sh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b\u2019s two opinions. If their request for arbitration involves a Muslim, however, then we are obliged to judge according to the consensus [of legal scholars and not just alSh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b]); if you turn away from them, they cannot harm you at all; and if you judge, between them, then judge justly between them; God loves the just, those that judge fairly, meaning that He will reward them.\n",

(If then they) i.e. the Banu Qurayzah and the Banu'l- Nadir (have recourse unto thee) Muhammad (judge between them) between the Banu Qurayzah and the Banu'l-Nadir; and it is also said: between the people of Khaybar (or disclaim jurisdiction) by choice. (If thou disclaimest jurisdiction) and do not judge between them, (then they cannot harm thee at all) they cannot take away anything from you. (But if thou judgest) between the Banu Qurayzah and the Banu'l-Nadir; and it is also said: between the people of Khaybar, (judge between them with equity) with stoning [married people who commit adultery]. (Lo! Allah loveth the equitable) who are fair when they judge with the Book of Allah and who apply the legal ruling of stoning.\n"
