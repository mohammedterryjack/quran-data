Forbid not the good things which Allah hath made lawful for you) this verse was revealed about ten Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) among them were Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'AN, 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud, 'Uthman Ibn Maz'un al-Jumahi, Miqdad Ibn al-Aswad al-Kindi, and Salim the client of Abu Hudhayfah Ibn 'Utbah, Salman al-Farisi, Abu Dharr, 'Ammar Ibn Yasir-these Companions vowed in the house of 'Uthman Ibn Maz'un that they would not eat or drink except that which was enough to keep them alive, that they would not have sex with their wives, that they would never eat meat or fat and that they would cut off their male organs. But Allah forbade them from such acts, and revealed about them: do not forbid the lawful things that Allah has permitted such as foods, drinks and having sex with your wives (and transgress not) by cutting off your male organs. (Lo! Allah loveth not transgressors) who move from the lawful to the unlawful by mutilating themselves.\n"
