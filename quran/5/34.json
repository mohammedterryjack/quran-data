This [proviso] is expressed without any statement to the effect \u2018do not submit them to prescribed legal punishment\u2019, to point out that when such a person repents only God\u2019s prescribed punishments (hud\u016bd) \u2014 and not those deriving from the rights of human beings \u2014 are waived. This is how I see it. I do not know of any that have tackled this [topic], and God knows best. If, then, a person has killed and stolen property, he should be killed and have his limbs cut off [on opposite sides], but not crucified \u2014 this is the more sound of two opinions held by al-Sh\u0101fi\u2018\u012b. However, his repentance is of no avail, once he has been overpowered [by the authorities] \u2014 this is also the more sound of two opinions held by him.\n",
