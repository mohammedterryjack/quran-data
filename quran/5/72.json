        "TRANSLATION_0": "Those who say that the Messiah, son of Maryam, is Allah are kafirun. The Messiah said, 'Tribe of Israel! worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. If anyone associates anything with Allah, Allah has forbidden him the Garden and his refuge will be the Fire.' The wrongdoers will have no helpers.",
        "TRANSLATION_1": "They are surely infidels who say: \"God is the Christ, son of Mary.\" But the Christ had only said: \"O children of Israel, worship God who is my Lord and your Lord.\" Whosoever associates a compeer with God, will have Paradise denied to him by God, and his abode shall be Hell; and the sinners will have none to help them.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "And surely they disbelieved when they said: 'Christ, the son of Mary, is indeed God'; whereas Christ had said: 'Children of Israel! Serve Allah, Who is your Lord and my Lord.' Allah has forbidden Paradise to those who associate anything with Him in His divinity and their refuge shall be the Fire. No one will be able to help such wrong-doers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_3": "Those who say that Jesus, the son of Mary, is God, have, in fact, turned to disbelief. Jesus said to the Israelites, \"Worship God, my Lord and yours. God will deprive anyone who considers anything equal to God of Paradise and his dwelling will be fire. The unjust people have no helpers.\"\n",
        "TRANSLATION_4": "They are certainly disbelievers who say, \u201cAllah is actually the Messiah, the son of Maryam\u201d; whereas the Messiah had said, \u201cO Descendants of Israel, worship Allah Who is my Lord and (also) your Lord\u201d; undoubtedly whoever ascribes partners with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him; his destination is hell; and the unjust do not have any supporters.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_5": "Surely, they have disbelieved who say: \"Allah is the Messiah [`Isa], son of Maryam.\" But the Messiah said: \"O Children of Israel! worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\" Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the wrongdoers there are no helpers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_6": "Certainly they disbelieve who say: Surely Allah, He is the Messiah, son of Marium; and the Messiah said: O Children of Israel! serve Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Surely whoever associates (others) with Allah, then Allah has forbidden to him the garden, and his abode is the fire; and there shall be no helpers for the unjust.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "They are unbelievers who say, 'God is the Messiah, Mary's son.' For the Messiah said, 'Children of Israel, serve God, my Lord and your Lord. Verily whoso associates with God anything, God shall prohibit him entrance to Paradise, and his refuge shall be the Fire; and wrongdoers shall have no helpers.'\n",
        "TRANSLATION_8": "They surely disbelieve who say: Lo! Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary. The Messiah (himself) said: O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.

        "TRANSLATION_9": "Indeed, they are deniers of the truth who say, \"God is the Christ, the son of Mary.\" For the Christ himself said, \"Children of Israel, serve God, my Lord and your Lord.\" If anyone associates anything with God, God will forbid him the Garden and the Fire will be his home. The wrongdoers shall have no helpers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_10": "Assuredly they have disbelieved who say: verily God: He is the Masih, son of Maryam, whereas the Masih had said: Children of Isra'il! worship Allah, mine Lord and your Lord; verily whosoever associateth aught with Allah, Allah shall surely forbid the Garden unto him, and his resort is the Fire; and for the wrong-doers there shall be no helpers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_11": "They are certainly faithless who say, \u2018Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary.\u2019 But the Messiah had said, \u2018O Children of Israel!

Indeed whoever ascribes partners to Allah, Allah shall forbid him [entry into] paradise, and his refuge shall be the Fire, and the wrongdoers will not have any helpers.\u2019\n",
        "TRANSLATION_12": "They do blaspheme who say: \"Allah is Christ the son of Mary.\" But said Christ: \"O Children of Israel! worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\" Whoever joins other gods with Allah,- Allah will forbid him the garden, and the Fire will be his abode. There will for the wrong-doers be no one to help.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_13": "Surely, they have disbelieved who say: \"Allah is the Messiah ['Iesa (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary).\" But the Messiah ['Iesa (Jesus)] said: \"O Children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\" Verily, whosoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers) there are no helpers.\n",

Whoever associates others with God, God has forbidden him Paradise, and his dwelling is the Fire. The wrongdoers have no saviors.\u201d\n",
        "TRANSLATION_16": "They have certainly disbelieved who say, \"Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary\" while the Messiah has said, \"O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\" Indeed, he who associates others with Allah - Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_17": "[5:72] They indeed are disbelievers those who say, \u2018Indeed God is the Messiah, son of Mary\u2019 (a similar verse has preceded [Q. 5:17]). For the Messiah said, to them, \u2018O Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord, for, I am a servant and not a god. Verily he who associates anything with God, in worship, for him God has made Paradise forbidden, He has forbidden him admittance to it, and his abode shall be the Fire; and for wrongdoers (wa-m\u0101 li\u2019l-z\u0101lim\u012bna min, the min is extra) there shall be no helpers\u2019, to guard them against the chastisement of God.\n",

(The Messiah (himself) said : Children of Israel, worship Allah) declare Allah's divine Oneness, (my Lord and your Lord. Lo! whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah) and dies in this state, (for him Allah hath forbidden Paradise. His abode) his end result (is the Fire. For evil-doers) idolaters (there will be no helpers) to save them from what is intended for them.\n"
