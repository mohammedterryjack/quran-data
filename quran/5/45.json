Although this stipulation was prescribed for   them, it is established in our Law; but whoever forgoes it, that is, retaliation, out of charity, able to restrain himself, then that shall be an expiation for him, of what he has done [of other sins]. Whoever does not judge according to what God has revealed, in the matter of retaliation and otherwise, those are the evildoers.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(And We prescribed for them) We obligated on the Children of Israel (therein) in the Torah: (The life for the life) that is premeditatedly killed as an expiation for this killing, (and the eye for the eye) that is premeditatedly ruined as an expiation for this ruination, (and the nose for the nose) that is premeditatedly damaged as an expiation for this damage, (and the ear for the ear) that is premeditatedly harmed as an expiation for this harm, (and the tooth for the tooth) that is premeditatedly broken as an expiation for this breaking, (and for wounds retaliation) as a just judgement. (But whoso forgoeth it (in the way of charity)) whoever forgoes retaliating (it shall be expiation for him) i.e. for the harmed person; it is also said: for the person who harmed. (Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed) Allah says: whoever does not show what the Qur'an has shown nor act according to it: (such are wrong-doers) who harm themselves with punishment.\n"
