Worse is he of whose sort Allah hath turned some to apes) in the time of the Prophet David (pbuh) (and swine) in the time of Jesus, after eating from the table that Allah sent from heaven, (and who serveth idols) soothsayers and devils; or he whom Allah has made the worshipper of the devil, idols and soothsayers.
