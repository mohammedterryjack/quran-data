        "TRANSLATION_1": "Say to them: \"O people of the Book, you have no ground (for argument) until you follow the Torah and the Gospel and what has been revealed to you by your Lord.\" But what has been revealed to you by your Lord will surely increase rebellion and unbelief in many; so do not grieve for those who do not believe.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_2": "Say to them: 'People of the Book! You have no solid ground to stand on unless you establish the Torah and the Gospel and all that had been revealed to you from your Lord.

        "TRANSLATION_3": "(Muhammad), tell the People of the Book, \"You have nothing unless you follow the Old and New Testaments and that which (the Quran) God has revealed to you.\" Whatever has been revealed to you (Muhammad) from your Lord will only increase their disbelief and rebellion (against you).

You are nothing until you establish the Taurat and the Injeel, and what was sent down towards you from your Lord\u201d; and this Book which has been sent down upon you from your Lord will cause many of them to advance in their rebellion and disbelief; so do not at all grieve for the disbelievers.\n",

        "TRANSLATION_6": "Say: O followers of the Book! you follow no good till you keep up the Taurat and the Injeel and that which is revealed to you from your Lord; and surely that which has been revealed to you from your Lord shall make many of them increase in inordinacy and unbelief; grieve not therefore for the unbelieving people.\n",
        "TRANSLATION_7": "Say: 'People of the Book, you do not stand on anything, until you perform the Torah and the Gospel, and what was sent down to you from your Lord.'

And what has been revealed to you from your Lord, of the Qur\u2019\u0101n, will surely increase many of them in insolence and disbelief, because of their disbelief in it; so do not grieve for the disbelieving folk, if they do not believe in you, in other words, do not be concerned with them.\n",
