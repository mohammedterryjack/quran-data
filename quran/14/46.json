        "TRANSLATION_17": "[14:46] And verily they plotted, against the Prophet (s), their plot \u2014 when they desired to kill him, or detain him [in his house] or banish him \u2014 but their plotting is with God, that is to say, knowledge or the requital thereof [is with God], and their plotting, even though it be great, was not such whereby mountains should be moved, meaning that it is not of any importance, but that they are only harming themselves thereby. It is said that the use of \u2018mountains\u2019 here is meant to be literal; alternatively, it is also said [to be a reference to] the laws of Islam, which are likened to these [mountains] in the way that they are established and fixed (a variant reading has la-taz\u016blu [instead of li-taz\u016bla], with in softened [from inna, \u2018verily\u2019], in which case the intended meaning is that [the extent of] their plotting is great. It is said that \u2018plotting\u2019 here is [actually a reference to] their unbelief. This second [reading] is consonant with [God\u2019s saying]: Whereby the heavens are almost torn and the earth split asunder and the mountains fall crashing [Q. 19:90]; according to the former [reading], however, one should read it as [if it were] wa-m\u0101 k\u0101na, and [their plotting] was not such \u2026).\n",
        "TRANSLATION_18": "(Verily they have plotted their plot) they did their deed through their denial of the messengers, (and their plot is with Allah) the punishment of their deed is with Allah, (though their plot were one whereby the mountains should be moved) whereby the mountains should crumble; it is also said that this means: the plotting of Nimrod was such that the mountains would have crumbled, for the sounds of the Ark and eagles were heard.\n"
