So do not blame me, but blame yourselves, for having responded to me. I cannot heed your [distress] call, [I cannot] bring aid to you, nor can you heed mine (read bi-musrikhiyya or bi-musrikh\u012b).

(I cannot help you) save you from the chastisement of hell, (nor can ye help me) nor can you save me from entering hell. (Lo! I disbelieved in that which ye before) before you associated it with me; it is also said that this means: I disbelieve today in that which you associate with me; he says: I disassociate myself from you and from your religion and from your 267 response to me before this, i.e. in the worldly life (ascribed to me) you associated with me.
