(And hasten not with the Qur'an) do not hasten, O Muhammad, to recite the Qur'an (ere its revelation hath been perfected unto thee) before Gabriel finishes reading the Qur'an to you. This is because when Gabriel used to bring new revelations, the Prophet (pbuh) would start to repeat them after Gabriel even before the latter finished his reading, for fear of forgetting what was recited to him. Allah therefore told him to stop doing this, saying: (and say) O Muhammad: (My Lord! Increase me in knowledge) and memorisation and understanding of the Qur'an as well as in judging by the Qur'an.\n"
