This is the Book of God . 
There is no doubt therein. 
It is guidance for the God-fearing: 
Those who believe 
in the realms of the unseen, 
and who duly establish the Prayer 
set by God , 

and who spend charitably 
out of what We have provided them; 
and those who further believe in this Quran 
that has been sent down to you, 
O Muhammad, as a revelation from God 
and who believe in the Scripture 
that has been sent down to the prophets 
who came before you, 
and those who, within themselves, 
have utter certainty 
of the imminence of the Hereafter. 
It is these who are advancing 
upon the path of guidance from their Lord. 
And so it is these who are the truly successful.

SURAH 2 I AL-BAQARAH - THE COW 



2:6 As for those who disbelieve, 

it is the same to them 

whether you forewarn them 

of the consequence of unbelief 

or you do not forewarn them. 

They will not believe. 
2:7 Therefore, God has set a seal 

upon their hearts and upon their hearing. 

And over their eyes, there is a veil. 

Thus for them there is a great torment 

awaiting in the Hereafter . 

2:8 Now, there are also among humankind 
those who say: 
We believe in God 

and in the coming Judgment of the Last Day! 

But they do not truly believe. 
2:9 They seek to deceive God 

and those who believe. 

Yet they deceive none but themselves, 

though they do not perceive it . 
2:io In their doubting hearts, there is a sickness. 

Therefore, God increases them in sickness. 

Thus for them there is a most painful torment 
awaiting in the Hereafter 

because they have lied about their faith . 
2:ii Now, when it is said to them: 

Do not spread corruption in the earth, they say: 

On the contrary, it is we who are the ones 

sowing righteousness! 
2:12 Most assuredly no ! 

Indeed, it is they themselves 

who are the sowers of corruption. 

Yet they do not perceive it .

Believe in the Heavenly message , 

as the people of true faith have believed, 

they say: 

Shall we believe as the fools have believed? 
Most assuredly no ! 

Indeed, it is they themselves who are the fools. 
Yet they do not know it . 
Thus when they meet those who believe, 
they say: 

We too have believed! 

But when they are alone with their evil ones, 
they say: 

We are, indeed, with you! 
We were only making mockery of them ! 
Rather, it is God 
who makes a mockery of them, 
for He lets them continue in their transgression, 
wandering blindly. 
These are the ones 
who have purchased misguidance 
at the cost of guidance. 

Thus their trade has not profited their souls , 
for they have not been guided aright. 
Their parable is this : 

They are like one who seeks to kindle a fire 
for his companions . 
Then when it has begun 
to shine out all around him, 
God takes away their light, 
and He leaves them enveiled in darkness, 
unable to see. 
Deaf, dumb, and blind — 
never shall they return to guidance .

of darkness, and thunder, and lightning. 
They put their fingers in their ears 
to shield themselves 

against the peals of thunder, wary of death. 
Yet God is all-encompassing of the disbelievers. 
2:20 The lightning nearly snatches away their sight. 
Whenever it shines forth for them, 
they walk in its light . 

But when suddenly it darkens all about them, 

they stand still. 

And had God so willed, 

He, most surely, could have taken away 

their hearing and their sight altogether . 

Indeed, God is powerful over all things. 

2:21 O humankind! 

Worship your Lord, who created you

Therefore, you shall not set up rivals to God

2:23 And if you are in doubt about the divine origin 
of what We have sent down

Moreover, call all your witnesses,

to prove your claim, if you are truthful. 
2:24 Yet if you cannot do so — 

and never shall you do so — 

then fear the Fire of Hell , 

whose fuel is people and stones — 
a Fire prepared for the disbelievers. 
2.25 But give glad tidings, O Prophet, 

to those who believe and do righteous deeds 

that for them there are Gardens of Paradise 

awaiting in the Hereafter , 

beneath which rivers flow. 

Whenever they are provided from it 

of its varied Heavenly fruits 

as a provision to enjoy , they will say: 

This is, in appearance,

And, indeed, it shall be brought to them 

in full resemblance, 

yet being far more delectable ! 

And so too shall they have 

in these Gardens of Delight 

spouses who are ever pure. 

And, therein, 

shall they abide with them forever.

Then, as for those who believe, 
they know well 

that such an example is, indeed, the truth 
from their Lord. 
But as for those who disbelieve, 
they say, with contempt : 
What would God intend 
with such an unworthy example? 
Say to them: 
It is a test of choice. 
By this H e leads many astray. 
And by this He guides many. 
Yet He does not lead anyone astray, thereby,

2:27 those who break the covenant of God 

after it has been solemnly pledged before Him ; 

and who cut off the relations 

that God has commanded to be kept joined; 

and who spread corruption in the earth. 

It is such as these who are the losers 

of an everlasting Paradise . 

2:28 How can you human beings disbelieve in God 
when you were once lifeless, 
and He gave you life; 
then He causes you to die; 
then He shall again give you life; 
then to Him 

shall you all be returned for Judgment ?

Your Lord said to the angels: 
I am placing upon the earth

They said: 

Will You place thereupon

and who, moreover, will shed blood, 

while we ever exalt You with all praise

He said: 

Indeed, I know what you do not know.

Thereafter, He arrayed them before the angels.

Bow your faces down to receive Adam 
into life and to honor him ! 
So they all bowed down, except Iblis. 
He refused and grew greatly arrogant. 
And thus did he become 
of the rebellious disbelievers. 
2:35 Thereafter, We said: O Adam! 

Dwell, you and your wife, in the garden; 
and eat from it plentifully, both of you, 
wherever of it you so please. 
But you shall not come near 
this single tree to eat of its fruit . 
For, then, 

you shall both be of the wrongdoers. 
2:36 Yet Satan caused them both to eat from it 

and so slip from the garden . 

Thus did he expel them 

from where they had been secure . 

And so it was that We said to them all : 

Descend from here , 

being enemies to one another! 

Yet there is for you in the earth 

a place suitable for settlement, 

and of goodly provision, 

for a preordained time. 
2:37 Adam then received words of guidance 

from his Lord. 

Thus, He granted him repentance. 
For, indeed, it is He alone 
who is the All-Relenting, the Mercy-Giving.

Descend from it now , all together!

And in this, there was a great trial

2:50 And recall how We divided the sea for you. 
Thus We delivered you 
and drowned the House of Pharaoh, 
even while you were looking on. 

2:5i And recall when We promised to Moses 

an appointment of forty nights 
on Mount Tur in Sinai 

to receive the Torah . 

Then you took the Golden Calf as a god 

after him, when he had departed 

from your midst — and in this 

you became idolatrous wrongdoers! 
2:52 Then We pardoned you, even after this, 

so that you might give thanks.

the Book of the Torah 
and the criterion of right and wrong , 
so that you might be guided aright.

And recall when Moses said to his people: 
O my people! 

Indeed, you have wronged yourselves

Then He granted you repentance. 
Indeed, it is He

2:55 And recall when you said: O Moses! 

We shall never believe in you 

until we see God openly, before our very eyes . 

Then, suddenly, the thunderbolt seized you, 

even while you were looking on. 
2:56 Then We revived you after your death, 

so that you might give thanks. 
2:57 Furthermore, We shaded you in the desert 

with thin cloud cover. 

Moreover, We sent down upon you 

manna and quail, saying : 

Eat of the wholesome foods 

which We have provided you. 

And yet it was not Us whom they wronged 

with their defiant ingratitude . 

But, rather, it was their own souls 

they were all the while wronging.

Enter the blessed land of this city, 

and eat from it plentifully wherever you will. 

Yet you shall enter the gateway 

bowing down to God while you say in prayer : 

Disburden us, our Lord, 

from the consequences of our wrongdoing. 

Then We shall forgive you of your sins. 

And We shall increase the reward

So upon those who were doing wrong, 

We sent down a plague 

of castigation from the sky 

for the deeds of ungodliness 

they had committed. 

2:60 -S&amp;And recall how Moses sought drinking water 
in the desert for his people. 
So We said to him : 
Strike the stone with your staff! 
Then from it twelve springs burst forth. 
Each group of people knew its watering place. 
And it was said to them: 
Eat and drink freely 
from the generous provision of God. 
Yet you shall not make mischief in the earth, 
sowing corruption in it .

O Moses! 

Never shall we endure with patience 

one kind of food. 

So call upon your Lord for us, 

to bring forth for us some variation 

from what the earth grows — 

of its herbs and its cucumbers, 

and its garlic, and its lentils, and its onions.

Do you seek to substitute that which is lesser 
for that which is better?

So they were struck with humiliation 

and indigence. 

For they had brought upon themselves 

great wrath from God. 

That is because, again and again, 

they disbelieved in the revealed signs of God 

and killed His prophets without any right. 

That is because they disobeyed God 

and persistently transgressed His covenant . 

2:62 Indeed, those who believe in Islam , 
and those of Jewry, and the Christians, 
and the Sabians — 

whoever among them truly believes in God 
and in the coming Judgment of the Last Day 
and works righteousness — 
shall have their reward with their Lord in full ; 
and there shall be no fear upon them 
when they assemble for Judgment . 
Nor shall they ever grieve 
over the life of the world . 

2:63 And recall, O Children of Israel , 
when We took your pledge 
to fulfill Our covenant, 
and We lifted Mount Tur of Sinai 
above you, saying : 

Take hold of all that We have given you 
in the covenant with utmost power! 
And be ever mindful of 
what is prescribed in it, 
so that you may become truly God-fearing. 
2:64 But, thereafter, you turned away. 
And had it not been

for the grace of God upon you, and His mercy, 
most surely, 

you would have become among the losers

2:65 And truly, you have known already 

what became of those of you 

who violated the solemnity of the Sabbath. 

Thus, We said to them: 

Be you apes, most despicable! 
2:66 Thus We made it an exemplary punishment 

for the people of their time, 

and for those who succeeded them; 

and it remains an admonition 

to the God-fearing for all time . 

2:67 Moreover, behold! 

Moses said to his people: 

Indeed, God commands you 

to slaughter a cow in charitable sacrifice . 

They said: 

Do you mean to make a mockery of us? 
He said: 

I take refuge in God 
from ever being of the ignorant 
who mock God's commands ! 
2:68 They said: 

Call upon your Lord for us to make clear to us 
what sort of cow it may be. 
He said: 

Indeed, He says: 

It is to be a cow that is neither old 
nor a virgin calf — but midrange in between. 
So do at once as you are commanded. 
2:69 They said: 

Call again upon your Lord for us

to make clear to us what its color may be. 
He said: 

Indeed, He says:

that it gladdens all beholders. 
2:70 They said: 

Call again upon your Lord for us 

to make clear to us what sort of cow it may be; 

for, indeed, all cows look alike to us. 

If God so wills, we shall, most surely, 

be guided aright. 
2:71 He said: 

Indeed, He says: 

It is to be a cow never yoked to plow the land, 

nor to water the tillage, 

one which has been kept sound, 

without any blemish in it. 

They said: 

Now you have come out with the whole truth! 
Then reluctantly they slaughtered it — 
though very nearly they did not do so. 

2:72 And recall when some among you 
had killed a person, and therein 
you contended against each other — 
though God was to bring to light 
all that you were suppressing. 

2:73 So We said: 

Strike the slain one 

with part of the slaughtered cow, 

and he shall come to life !

so that you might reflect and believe

And some of them fall down

And never is God at all heedless of what you do.

hope for them to profess belief because of you, 
while already a group of them used to hear

2:76 Now, when they meet

But when they are alone with one another,

in the Torah , so that with it 
they can argue against you before your Lord? 
Will you not, then, understand and beware ? 
Do they not know that God knows well 
all that they conceal and all that they reveal? 
Rather, some among them are illiterate,

They do so to obtain thereby a small price. 
So woe to them 

for what their hands have written! 

And woe to them for what they earn from it ! 

Moreover, they have even said: 

Never will the Fire of Hell 

touch us in the Hereafter , 

except for a few numbered days. Say: 

Have you made a covenant with God 

promising you this ? 

For never will God fail His covenant! 

Or is it, rather, that you say about God 

what truly you do not know? 

Indeed, the truth 

is that whoever has earned an evil deed 

and is encompassed 

by the enormity of his sin — 

then it is these 

who are the Companions of the Fire of Hell . 

They shall abide therein forever. 

Yet those who truly believe 

and do righteous deeds, it is these 

who are the Companions 

of the Everlasting Garden of Paradise . 

They shall abide therein forever. 

Now, behold! 

We took the covenant of the Children of Israel, 
commanding them : 
You shall worship none but God. 
And to your parents you shall be good — 
as well as to close relatives, 
and to orphans, and to the indigent. 
And you shall speak to people in a goodly way.

that We took your covenant, 
commanding you that you shall not 
shed the blood of your own;

And to this you consented and bore witness. 
2:85 Then there you were

banding together against them

Then, when they have been seized

and they come to you as captives

it is you who ransom them

What, then, shall be the recompense

into the most severe torment of Hell . 
For never is God at all heedless of what you do. 
2:86 These are the ones who have purchased 
the life of this world 
at the cost of the Hereafter. 
Thus the torment 
shall never be lightened for them. 
Nor shall they ever be helped 
against God's punishment . 

2:87 Now, very truly, We gave Moses the Scripture, 

and following in his footsteps, 

We sent the Children of Israel 

many messengers. 

Then We gave Jesus, son of Mary, 

clear and miraculous proofs 
to confirm his truth to them . 

Moreover, We aided him 

with Angel Gabriel, the Holy Spirit. 

So is it that whenever a messenger 

comes to you with a message 

that your souls do not desire, 

you grow so very arrogant 

and you belie some messengers , 

while others you kill? 
2:88 Indeed, they have said of this revelation :

they disbelieved in it. 

So may the curse of God 

be upon the disbelievers! 
2:90 How woeful is that for which 

they have sold their souls! 

For it is only out of malice 

that they have disbelieved 

in what God has sent down — 

envious that God should send down guidance 

from His bounty upon whomever He so wills 

from among His servants. 

So they have brought upon themselves 

wrath upon wrath. 

And for the disbelievers, 

there shall be a disgracing torment. 
2:91 For when it is said to them: 

Believe in what God has sent down! 

They say: 

We believe only 

in what has been sent down to us! 

Thus, they disbelieve in what is beyond it, 

though it is the truth, 

confirming what is already with them. 

Say to them, O Prophet : 

Why, then, did you kill God's prophets of old 

who came specially to you , 

if, indeed, you are true believers 

in what has been sent down to you ? 
2:92 ^Moreover,

Then still you took the Golden Calf 
as a god , after him, when he had departed

and in this 

you became idolatrous wrongdoers! 

2:93 Furthermore, recall 

when We took your pledge 
to fulfill Our covenant, 
and We lifted Mount Tur of Sinai 
above you, saying : 

Take hold of all that We have given you 
in the covenant with utmost power, 
and hear, O Children of Israel ! 
But they said: 
We hear and we disobey! 
For profound adoration of the Golden Calf 
had infused deep into their hearts 
because of their incessant unbelief in God . 
Say to them : 

Woeful is what your false faith bids you to , 

if, indeed, you are believers! 
2:94 Say to the Children of Israel : 

If the abode of the Hereafter with God 

is, indeed, purely for you, 

to the exclusion of all other people, 

then wish for death, if, indeed, you are truthful. 
2:95 But never will they ever wish for it,

what their hands in this life have forwarded 
for the Hereafter . 

And God is all-knowing about the wrongdoers 
who are godless in heart .

even more than those 
who associate gods with God. 
Each one of them who disbelieve 
would love that his life be prolonged 
for a thousand years — 

though, still, this would not remove such a one 

from the torment of Hellfire , 

even if he should live that long . 

For God is all-seeing of all that they do. 

Say, O Prophet: 

Woe to whomever is an enemy 

to Angel Gabriel. 

For, indeed, it is he 

who has brought this Quran 

to your own heart from on high — 

by the permission of God — 

as a confirmation 

of all the Heavenly revelations that preceded it, 
and as guidance to salvation and glad tidings 
of an everlasting Paradise for the believers. 
Whoever is an enemy to God, 
and His angels, and His messengers — 
and especially to angels Gabriel and Michael — 
then let it be known, that , most surely, 
God is an enemy to all the disbelievers. 



Now, very truly, We have sent down to you, 
O Prophet, in this Quran 
clear Heavenly verses. 
Thus none shall disbelieve in them 
but the ungodly. 
2:ioo Is it that whenever these Children of Israel 
make a covenant with God , 
a group of them must cast it away? 



25 



SURAH 2 I AL-BAQARAH - THE COW

Rather, most of them do not truly believe. 
2:ioi For even now, when a messenger 

has come to them from God — 

and his description is in confirmation 

of what was already with them in the Torah — 

a group of those to whom 

that Scripture was given 

did cast the Book of God behind their backs, 

as though they did not know it to be true . 
2:102 So too, before this, 

did they follow what the satans 

deceptively recited to their predecessors 

during the reign of Solomon. 

And, most surely, Solomon did not disbelieve 

or learn sorcery, as they have alleged , 

but it was the satans themselves 

who disbelieved, teaching the people sorcery. 

Moreover, thereafter, 

they followed into unbelief what was sent down 

to the two angels of Babylon, Harut and Marut. 

Yet the two of them did not teach anyone 

without first saying to them : 

We are but a test of faith, 

sent from God to expose the evil of sorcery . 

So do not disbelieve by learning it . 

Even so, they did learn from them 

that by which they could separate 

a man from his wife. 

Yet they could not harm anyone with it, 

except by God's permission. 

Thus they learned 

what would harm their own souls, 

rather than benefit their own souls. 

For, most surely, they knew 

that whoever acquired this evil knowledge

So how woeful a price it is 
for which they have sold their souls — 
if only they were to know 
the graveness of their sin . 
2:103 And had they believed and been God-fearing 
then, most surely, their reward from God 
would have been far better, 
if only they were to know 
the delight in the Hereafter 
awaiting the believers . 

2:104 O you who believe! 

Do not say to the Prophet : 
Retina, pay heed to us! 
But, rather, say: 

Unzurnd, grant us consideration — 
and listen, thereafter, attentively to him ! 
Indeed, for the disbelievers 
there shall be a most painful torment. 
2:105 Those who disbelieve from among 
the People of the Scripture — 
along with the idolaters — 
wish that nothing good 
would ever be sent down to you believers 
from your Lord. 

But it is God who singles out for His mercy 
whomever He so wills. 
For God alone

And there shall be no fear upon such as these

Nor shall they ever grieve

2:ii3 Nevertheless, the Jews say:

And the Christians say:

Yet they recite from the same Scripture. 

Moreover, these idolaters —

shall disavow all those who followed them — 

as they behold the imminent torment 

that awaits them . 

Thus all ties between them 

shall be utterly cut off. 
2:167 And those who were followers 

shall say of their leaders : 

If only we had a chance 

to return to life in the world ! 

Then we would disavow them 

as they now have disavowed us. 

Thus will God show them 

the enormity of their deeds, 

heaping much overwhelming regret 

upon them. 

For never shall they emerge 
from the Fire of Hell . 

2:168 O humankind! 

Eat from whatever is upon the earth 

that is lawful and wholesome. 

Yet do not follow the footsteps of Satan. 

For, indeed, he is a clear enemy to you. 
2:169 Thus, he but commands you 

to every evil and lewdness, 

and that you should say about God 

what you do not know.

2:170 When the disbelievers 

are admonished with this, and it is said to them: 
Follow what God has sent down! 
They say: 

Rather, we shall follow only that to which 
we found our forefathers adhering. 

Will they do so even if their forefathers 
did not understand anything 

about the truth of God , 
nor were they guided aright? 
2-.171 This is the parable of those who disbelieve 

in the call of their messenger : 

It is like the case of a shepherd 

who hollers out to flocks that hear nothing 

but mere calls and cries. 

Deaf, dumb, and blind in heart — 

never shall they understand. 

2:172 O you who believe! 

Eat of the wholesome foods 

which We have provided you. 

And give thanks to God, 

if, indeed, it is He alone whom you worship. 
2:173 Indeed, He has but forbidden you to eat 

carrion, and blood, and the flesh of swine, 

and that over which 

other than the name of God has been invoked 

at the time of slaughter . 
But whoever is compelled 

by circumstance to eat any of this — 
without being rebellious 
and without being a willful transgressor — 
then no penalty of sin shall there be upon him. 
Indeed, God is all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 
2:174 As for those who suppress any part

of what God has sent down in the Scripture — 

and thereby sell it for a small price — 

they do nothing but consume fire from Hell 

into their bellies. 

Nor shall God speak to them 

on the Day of Resurrection. 

Nor shall He purify them from the stain of sin . 

Thus for them, 

there is a most painful torment awaiting . 
2:175 These are the ones 

who have purchased misguidance 
at the cost of guidance, 

and eternal torment at the cost of forgiveness. 
Oh, with what shocking patience 

shall they endure the Fire of Hell ! 
2:176 This they deserve 

because God sent down the Scripture 

to His messengers with the truth. 

Then the wrongdoers suppressed it . 
And, indeed, 

those of the People of the Scripture 
who dispute about the Scripture 
are yet in uttermost schism 
about its true tidings . 
2:177 ifr Righteousness in the sight of God 
is not the mere turning of your faces 
toward the East or the West. 
Rather, true righteousness 
dwells in one who believes in God, 
and in the coming Judgment of the Last Day, 
and in the angels, and in every revealed Book, 
and in all the prophets; 
and dwells in one, who — 
despite his love for it — 
gives of his wealth in charity

to close relatives and orphans, 

and to the indigent and the wayfarer, 

and to beggars, 

and for the emancipation of slaves; 

and dwells in one who establishes the Prayer 

and gives the Zakat-Charity; 

and dwells in all those 

who fulfill their covenant 

when they make a covenant, 

as well as in those who are patient 

during periods of affliction and harm 

and times of conflict. 

These are the ones who have been truehearted, 
and it is such as these who are the God-fearing. 

2:178 O you who believe! 

Equivalence in retribution is prescribed for you 
regarding all those who are murdered. 
For instance: 

The life of the freeman who has killed 

for the life of the freeman he has killed ; 

and the life of the slave who has killed 

for the life of the slave he has killed ; 

and the life of the female who has killed 

for the life of the female she has killed . 

But if one is granted a pardon from execution 

by his brother in faith , 

then let the latter pursue restitution , 

in accordance with what is right. 

Moreover, let his due compensation 

be remitted in a most excellent way. 

This commandment is an alleviation 

from your Lord, and thus a mercy from Him, 

for it frees you from lawless vengeance . 

So whoever commits an offense of reprisal 



he 



46

SURAH 2 I AL-BAQARAH - THE COW 



after this compensation is taken , then for him, 
there shall be a most painful torment 
in the Hereafter . 
2:179 Hence, there is life for all of you in retribution, 
O people of discretion and understanding, 
so that you may be ever God-fearing. 

2:180 Prescribed for you believers , 

when death approaches any one of you 

who shall leave behind wealth, 

is that he make a will 

for his parents and nearest relatives, 

in accordance with what is right. 

This is an obligation upon the God-fearing. 
2:i8i Thus whoever changes a will 

after hearing it from a testator , 

the guilt of sin shall fall only upon those 

who make the change in it. 

Indeed, God is all-hearing, all-knowing. 
2:182 Yet as to one who fears erroneous inclination 

from the testator, 

or willful violation of the heirs' due right, 
and who then sets matters aright between them, 
no guilt of sin shall fall upon him. 
Indeed, God is all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 

2:183 O you who believe! 

Fasting is prescribed for you 

as it has been prescribed 

for those who have believed before you, 

so that you may be ever God-fearing. 
2:184 It is for a specified number of days. 

But one among you who is sick 

or is on a journey shall then fast 

the same number of other days.

Yet for those who are hardly able to endure it, 
and do not fast, the redemption for each day 

is feeding an indigent person instead . 

And if one volunteers a good offering 
over and above this , it is better for him, still . 

However, if you fast despite difficulty, 

it is best for you, if only you were to know. 
2:185 It was the month of Ramadan 

in which the Quran was first sent down 

as guidance for all people, 

having in it clear proofs of divine guidance 

and the criterion for right and wrong . 

So whoever among you 

bears witness to the month shall then fast it. 

Yet if one among you is sick or is on a journey 
such a person shall then fast the same number 

of other days. 

God intends for you ease, 

and does not intend for you hardship. 

Rather, He wills for you to complete 

the number of prescribed days — 

and that you shall extol God 

for the blessing of faith 

to which He has guided you, 

so that you may give thanks 
to Him alone for easing its way 

and establishing you therein . 
2:186 Now, if My servants ask you, 

0 Prophet, about Me — 
then, indeed, I am near. 

1 answer the call of the caller 
when he calls upon Me. 

Then let them all respond to Me 

and believe in Me, 

so that they may be rightly guided.

They are a garment for you. 
And you are a garment for them. 
God knows 

that before granting this permission, 
you used to betray yourselves. 
Thus He has granted you repentance

So now you may lie with them

God has decreed for you. 

Moreover, you may now eat and drink

But do not ever lie with them

These are the ordained limits of God. 
Therefore, do not approach them. 
Thus does God make clear 
His revealed signs to all people, 
that they may be ever God-fearing. 
2:188 Moreover, you shall not consume 
one another's wealth by false means, 
nor proffer any of it to bribe those in authority, 
in order to sinfully consume

about the significance of the lunar crescents

They are but time-marks for people 
and for the Hajj -Pilgrimage. 
Thus there is no virtue in the pagan custom 
that after making the Pilgrimage 
you return home and come into your houses 
from openings you rend in their back walls . 
Rather, true virtue is exemplified 
in the conduct of one who is God-fearing. 
So come into your homes 
from their proper doors. 
And be ever God-fearing, 
so that you may be successful. 

2:190 Furthermore, fight in the path of God 

all those who fight you. 

But do not commit aggression. 

Indeed, God does not love those 

who commit aggression. 
2:i9i Yet if they continue 

in their aggression against you, 

kill them wherever you encounter them. 

And expel them 

from wherever they have expelled you. 
For persecution 

is far more grievous than killing. 

But do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque, 

unless they first fight you therein. 

Yet if they fight you there , then kill them. 

Such is the recompense of the disbelievers. 
2:192 But if they desist, then, indeed, 

God is all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 
2:193 Moreover, fight them 

until there is no more persecution,

and religion is for God alone. 
But if they desist, 

then let there be no ongoing hostility, 

except against the wrongdoers 

who are godless in heart. 
2:194 Reprisal in the Sacred Month 

is rightly due for aggression 

in the Sacred Month, 

for there is to be retribution 

for violating the sacred. 

So whoever commits aggression 

against you believers therein , 

then you may rightfully commit 

the like of that aggression against him. 

Yet be ever God-fearing, and know that God 

is with the God-fearing. 
2.195 And thus shall you spend freely for defense 

in the path of God. 

Yet do not cast your souls, 

by your own hands, into destruction. 

Rather, do good to one and all . 

Indeed, God loves those 

who excel in doing good. 
2:196 So complete the Hajj -Pilgrimage 

and the c Umrah-Lesser Pilgrimage 

solely for the sake of God. 

But if you are prevented therefrom , 

then send forth 

whatever charitable-offering of sacrifice 
is ready at hand. 

Yet you shall not ritually shave your heads 

until the charitable-offering reaches 

its destination for sacrifice . 

As to whoever among you becomes sick, 

or has an ailment of the head 




51

that requires shaving, 

then the due redemption is fasting, 

or giving charity, 

or a charitable-offering of sacrifice. 

But when you become safe and secure, 

then whoever takes advantage of performing 

the 'Umrah-Lesser Pilgrimage separately , 

before the designated days of Hajj -Pilgrimage, 

let him then send forth 

whatever charitable-offering of sacrifice 

is ready at hand. 

But if one of you does not find the means 
to make an offering , 

then fasting three days during Hajj -Pilgrimage 
is obligatory — 

and seven days when you return home . 
This is a total often days . 
That is for one whose family 
does not reside in the precincts 
of the Sacred Mosque. 
Thus be ever God-fearing! 
And know that God is severe in punishment. 
2:197 The time-frame of the Hajj -Pilgrimage 
falls within the well-known months 
at the end of the lunar year . 
So whoever determines to undertake 
the Hajj -Pilgrimage therein, 
then there shall be no sexual relations, 
nor ungodliness, nor disputation, 
during the Hajj -Pilgrimage. 
And whatever good you do, God knows it. 
Moreover, take with you

Therefore, fear Me,

2:198 It is not a sin for you during Hajj -Pilgrimage 

if you seek to obtain bounty from your Lord 

through commerce . 

Yet when you pour forth 

from the plain of c Arafat, 

then remember God much 

with most solemn reverence 

at the sacred waymark of Muzdalifah . 

And remember Him always 

with much solemn reverence , 

as He has guided you. 

And, indeed, before this 

you were of those gone astray. 
2:199 Thus be sure to pour forth from c Arafat , 

where all the people 

have poured forth in the past . 

And seek God's forgiveness. 

Indeed, God is all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 
2:200 Yet even when you have concluded your rites 

of Hajj -Pilgrimage , 

then still you shall remember God 

with much solemn reverence , 

like your past remembrance 

of your forefathers — 

or with yet greater solemnity 

and remembrance. 

Now, among people, 
there are those who say in supplication : 
Our Lord! Give to us in this world! 
Yet such a one has no Heavenly share 
in the Hereafter. 
2:201 But among them are those who say:

And God is swift in reckoning.

And he openly calls upon God to bear witness

arrogant pride carries him into yet more sin. 
Thus sufficient for him is Hell —

And so they scoff at those who believe. 

But those who are God-fearing 

shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection. 

For God alone gives provision 

to whomever He so wills without measure. 
2:213 Once, all people were one faith -community. 

Then they differed. 

So God sent forth the prophets, 

as bearers of glad tidings and forewarners. 

And with them, 

He sent down the Heavenly Scripture 
with the truth, 

so as to judge between people 
about that wherein they disputed. 
Yet none other than those peoples

disputed over it —

Say to them :

for three monthly periods before remarrying . 

Nor is it lawful for them therein 

to conceal what God has created

For their husbands have full right to restore

if they truly desire reconciliation. 

Yet for women, there are rights equal 

to what is enjoined upon them, 

in accordance with what is right. 

But commensurate

men shall have a degree over them.

unless both have cause to fear

the first or second divorce pronouncement 

to your wives and they reach the end

you believers shall not impede them

in accordance with what is right. 

With this, let whoever among you 

who believes in God

These commandments 

are most befitting for you

For God knows

mothers shall nurse their children 

two full years, for one who desires to complete 

the nursing period . 

And incumbent upon the child's father 

is supplying their provision and their clothing,

No soul shall be tasked beyond its capacity. 

No mother shall be harmed for her child, 

nor a father for his child. 

Moreover, incumbent upon the father's heir

But if both parents desire to wean the child

But do not make a fi rm promise

of His revealed verses clear to you, 
so that you may understand them . 

2:243 Have you not considered the miraculous case 
of those from the Children of Israel 
who in the spirit of cowardice 
departed from their dwellings in thousands, 
fearful of death, whereupon God said to them: 
Die all of you ! 

and, thereafter, brought them back to life? 

Indeed, God is ever bountiful to all people. 

But most people do not give thanks

a goodly loan for His cause , 

so that He may multiply it for him

For it is God alone who withholds and extends 
reward and abundant provision . 
And to Him alone shall you all be returned. 

2.246 Have you not also considered 

the case of the elders of the Children of Israel 
after Moses? 

They said to a prophet of theirs:

Appoint for us a king and we will fight 
in the path of God! 
He said: 

Might it be that if fighting is prescribed for you 
you will not fight? 
They said: 

Why should we not fi ght in the path of God 
while truly we have been driven out 
ofourown dwellings 
and deprived of our children 
whom they have killed ? 
But when fighting was prescribed for them, 
they turned away from it — 
all but a few of them. 

And God is all-knowing about the wrongdoers 
who are godless in heart . 
2:247 Thus their prophet said to them: 

Indeed, God has appointed Saul for you 
as a king. 
They said: 
How can it be 

that he shall have kingship over us, 

while we are nobles 

more worthy of kingship than him, 

and while he has not even been given 

any abundance of wealth? 

He said: 

Indeed, God has chosen him over you 
and has increased him amply 
in knowledge and in stature. 
For God gives His dominion 
to whomever He so wills. 
And God is all-encompassing, all-knowing. 
2:248 Thus their prophet said to them: 
Indeed, the sign of his kingship 



-If,,

is that the ark of the covenant will come to you 
from the hand of the enemy , 
wherein shall be tranquility for your hearts 
from your Lord 

and a remnant of what the Family of Moses 
and the Family of Aaron 
have left behind. 

And carrying it shall be the angels. 
Indeed, in this there is a sure sign for you 
if, indeed, you are believers. 
2:249 So when Saul set out with the hosts of Israel, 
he said: 

God shall, indeed, test you with thirst 
when you come to a river. 
Thus whoever drinks of it is not of me. 
And whoever does not taste it, he is of me — 
except one who is compelled 
to scoop up a single scoop with his hand. 
But they all drank their fill of it, 
except a few of them. 
Then when he had crossed it — 
he and those few who believed with him — 
they said in their council : 
There is no force of strength for us today 
compared with Goliath and his hosts! 
But those who realized that they would certainly 
meet God said: 
How many a small company 
of believers has prevailed 
over a more numerous company 
of the ungodly , by God's permission? 
And God is with those who are patient. 
2:250 So when they came forth 

to engage Goliath and his hosts, they said:

2:253 -5;rOf these messengers — 

We have shown preference 

to some above others: 

Among them 

are those to whom God has spoken. 
And some of them He raised higher by degrees. 
Thus We gave Jesus, son of Mary,

to confirm his truth . 
Moreover, We aided him

And had God so willed,

So among them are those who believed. 

And among them are those who disbelieved. 

And had God so willed,

Yet God does all that He intends.

Slumber does not overtake Him, nor does sleep. 

To Him belongs all that is in the heavens

rectitude has been made clearly distinct 
from perversity. 

Thus whoever disbelieves in false deities 
and believes in God alone 
has truly grasped the firmest handhold, 
which is forever unbreakable. 
And God is all-hearing, all-knowing.

2:258 Have you not considered the folly 
of the one who arrogantly argued 
with Abraham about his Lord — 
simply because God had given him 
the kingship? 

When Abraham said to him : 

My Lord is He who gives life and gives death, 

he said: 

I give life and give death. 

Abraham said:

so you bring it from the West. 
Thus he who disbelieved was confounded. 
For God does not guide the wrongdoing people 
who are godless in heart . 
2:259 Or consider the case 

of the sincere and humble one 

from the prophets of Israel 

who passed by a town, 

desolate and toppled upon its rooftops. 

He said: 

How will God ever give life to all this 
after its death? 

So God caused him to die for a hundred years. 
Then He resurrected him. 
God said to him : 
How long have you tarried? 
He said: 

I have tarried a day, or some part of a day. 
He said: No. 

Rather, you have tarried a hundred years! 

But look at your food and your drink. 

They have not spoiled. 

And look at the remnants of your donkey, 

so that We may make you 

a clear sign of resurrection for people. 

Now look at the bones of the donkey , 

how We set them together , 

then clothe them with flesh! 

So when it all became clear to him, he said: 

I know now with certainty 

that God is, indeed, powerful over all things!

Show me how You give life to the dead.

Do not nullify your charitable acts

while he does not truly believe in God

The likeness of such a one

beneath which rivers flow, 

wherein he has every kind of fruit, 

but then old age strikes him

2:267 O you who believe!

from the earth. 

Thus do not target what is vile 
to spend from it in charity , 
though you yourselves would not take it, 
without closing your eyes to accept it.

Therefore, let him write.

then let his guardian dictate them with justice. 

Moreover, bring two witnesses 

from your men to witness it . 

But if there are not two men, 

then you may bring a man and two women 

from those whom you mutually approve of 

as witnesses, 

so that if one of the two should err 

then the other one can remind her . 

Nor shall the witnesses refuse to bear witness 

when they are called upon to do so . 

Still, you shall not be loath to write it down 

in a contract — be it small or large in value — 

together with its due term. 

That is more just than oral agreement 

in the sight of God, 

and more suitable for testimony, 

and likelier to safeguard you 

from becoming doubtful. 

Excepted from this command 

to write down terms is an immediate transaction 

transferred between yourselves. 

In such case , 

then, there shall be no blame on you 

for not writing it down. 

But otherwise have witnesses 

when you sell to one another. 

Moreover, neither scribe nor witness 

shall be harmed. 

For if ever you do so, 

it shall be deemed grave ungodliness 

on your part. 

Therefore, be ever God-fearing.

and thereby seeking 
to distort its interpretation.

its ultimate interpretation except God. 

Thus, those well-grounded in knowledge say: 

We believe in it. All of it is from our Lord. 

And none is truly mindful of this 

but those who are endowed 

with discretion and understanding 
and thus heed admonition, and so pray: 
3:8 Our Lord! Let not our hearts swerve 

after You have guided us. 

And grant us mercy 

from Your own providence . 

Indeed, it is You, You alone , 

who are the All-Granting. 
3:9 Our Lord! 

You shall certainly gather all people 

for a Day Hereafter , 

about which there is no doubt. 

Indeed, God does not fail to fulfill 

the promise He makes .

3:10 As for those who disbelieve — 

never shall their wealth, nor their children, 
avail them against God in anything at all . 
And it is they who are the fuel 
for the Fire of Hell . 

3:ii Such was the case with the House of Pharaoh, 
and all those who disbelieved before them. 
They denied Our signs. 

Then, suddenly, God seized them by their sins, 
for God is severe in punishment. 

3:12 Say, O Prophet, to those who disbelieve: 

You shall be defeated. 

And you shall be mustered to Hell — 

and a most woeful cradle it is ! 
3:13 There has already been, 

for you who disbelieve , 

a sure sign of the triumph of faith 

in the encounter of the two companies 
at the Battle of the Wells of Badr : 

One company, fighting in the path of God; 

and the other — staunch disbelievers, 

who saw the believers with their very eyes 

as twice their own number. 

For God aids with His victory 

whomever He so wills. 

Indeed in this, there is a sure lesson 

for those who have eyes to see! 

3:14 Made fair-seeming to people 
are their beloved desires — 
as to women, and begetting children, 
and heaped up piles of gold and silver, 
and well-bred horses, and cattle, and tillage.

Yet with God is the most excellent resort. 
3 : i5 -JifSay. O Prophet, to humanity : 
Shall I tell you of something 
far better than this, 

reserved for those who are God-fearing? 
They shall have Gardens of Paradise 
with their Lord, beneath which rivers flow, 
wherein they shall abide forever — 
along with spouses, ever pure, 
and the good pleasure of God. 
And God is all-seeing of all His servants. 
3:16 It is they who say penitently : 

Our Lord, we have, indeed, believed. 
So forgive us our sins. 
And save us 

from the torment of the Fire of Hell . 
These are the patient ones , the truthful ones , 
the devoutly obedient, the givers of charity, 
and the seekers of forgiveness at night's end. 
God Himself bears witness that, indeed, 
there is no God but Him — as do the angels, 
and those with knowledge — 
that He is the One upholding justice. 
There is no God but Him, 
the Overpowering, the All- Wise. 
3:1.9 Indeed, the true religion with God 

that He has revealed to all the prophets is Islam, 
a willing submission to God alone . 
As for those who were previously 
given the Scripture, 

they did not dispute among themselves 
regarding the true religion ,

of the Scripture had come to them,

Yet whoever disbelieves 
in the revealed signs of God, know, then, 

that God is, indeed, swift in reckoning. 
3:20 So if they argue with you 

about God, O Prophet , then say: 
Willingly, have I submitted my face 

in worship to God alone , 

as have those who follow me. 

And say, moreover, 

to those who were given the Scripture 

and to those who are unlettered in revelation : 

Will you not 

submit yourselves to God willingly? 
Thus if they willingly submit themselves , 
then truly they are rightly guided. 
But if they turn away, 

then what is incumbent upon you is no more 
than the clear conveyance of the message . 
And God is all-seeing of all His servants. 

3:2i As to those who disbelieve in the signs of God, 
and who kill the prophets without any right, 
and who kill those among the people 
who enjoin justice — give them heavy tidings 
of a most painful torment.

are rendered utterly futile with God — 
in this world and in the Hereafter.

Never will the Fire of Hell touch us, 
in the Hereafter

For these lies they have forged in their religion 
have deluded them. 
3:25 How then shall it be

the All- Wise Reminder — for all humanity . 
3:59 Indeed, the likeness of the creation of Jesus, 

with respect to God, 

is as the likeness of that of Adam: 

He created him out of dust. 

Then He said to him: Be! And he was.

Let us call upon our sons and your sons,

And God alone is the Patron of the believers.

Profess faith at the start of the day

And renounce faith at day's end,

He gives it to whomever He so wills. 
And God is all-encompassing, all-knowing.

We do not differentiate in faith

Thus are we muslims,

3:85 And so, anyone after this 

who seeks submission to God 

through a religion other than Islam 
as revealed to all the prophets — 

never shall it be accepted from him! 

Moreover, in the Hereafter, 

he shall be among the losers

3:86 How shall God guide a people 

who have disbelieved

and after the clear proofs of God

For God does not guide the wrongdoing people

there have remained in it clear signs — 
such as the Station of Abraham. 
Moreover, whoever enters its sanctuary 
shall be secure. 
Thus Hajj -Pilgrimage 
to the Sacred House in Makkah 
is owed to God, 
as an obligation upon all people 
who are able to attain a way to it. 
And as to those who disbelieve this,

without any need 

for any of His creation in all the worlds.

3:98 Say: O People of the Scripture! 

Why do you disbelieve 

in the revealed signs of God, 

while you yourselves know 

that God is all-witnessing over what you do? 
3.99 Moreover, say: O People of the Scripture! 

Why do you bar from the straight path of God 

those who believe, seeking to render it crooked, 

while you are charged 

to be witnesses to its truth ? 

Yet never is God at all heedless of what you do. 

3:ioo O you who believe! 

Were you to obey the dictates 

of a certain faction of those 

who have been given the Scripture, 

they would turn you back into disbelievers 

after your having come to faith. 

3:ioi Yet how could you disbelieve, 
while it is to you yourselves 
that the verses of God are being recited? 
Moreover, His Messenger is among you! 
So know well 

that whoever holds fast to faith in God, 
then it is he who is most surely guided 
along a straight way of salvation . 

3:io2 O you who believe! 

Be ever God-fearing, with a fear justly due Him. 

And do not die, except while you are muslims, 

in willing submission to God alone . 
3:io3 So hold fast to the rope of God — 

all of you together! You shall not divide! 

And remember with reverence 

the grace of God upon you

when you were enemies 

and He bound your hearts together, 

so that you became — by His grace — 

brothers to one another . 

For you were on the brink of a pit of Fire. 

And He rescued you from it. 

Thus does God make His revealed signs 

clear to you, so that you may be guided aright. 
3:104 So let there be of you one united community 

calling to all that is good 

and enjoining what is right 

and forbidding what is wrong. 

And it is these who are the truly successful. 
3:105 Therefore, be not like those 

who became divided 

and disputed regarding the true religion — 
even after the clear 
and miraculous proofs of God 
had come to them! 
Indeed, for these, 

there shall be a great torment awaiting 
3:106 on a Day Hereafter 
when some faces 
shall be whitened with purity , 
and some faces blackened by sin . 
As for those whose faces shall be blackened, 
it will be said : 

Did you disbelieve after professing your faith? 
Then taste the everlasting torment 
in that before this Day you have disbelieved! 
3:107 Yet as for those whose faces shall be whitened, 
they shall be secure in the mercy of God. 
Therein shall they abide forever.

that We recite to you, O Prophet, 
with the very essence of all truth. 
And never does God desire injustice 
for any being in all the worlds. 
3:109 For to God alone belongs 
all that is in the heavens 
and all that is in the earth. 
Indeed, to God alone 
are all matters returned for just judgment . 

3:iio You believers are the best Community 

ever brought forth for the good of humankind: 
You enjoin what is right. 
And you forbid what is wrong. 
And you believe in God. 

Yet if only the People of the Scripture 
had believed! 

It most surely would have been better for them. 
Among them, there are believers. 
But most of them are ungodly. 
3:in So be comforted 

that they shall not inflict harm upon you, 

except a slight hurt. 

And if they should fight you, 

they shall ultimately turn away from you 

in retreat. 

Then they shall not be helped by God . 
3-.112 They shall be struck with humiliation 
wherever they are encountered — 
except if they have a bond of covenant 
with God, 

or a bond of peace and security 

with the people of the community . 

For they have incurred great wrath from God.

Moreover, they shall be struck with indigence. 

That is because, again and again, 

they have disbelieved 

in the revealed signs of God 

and killed His prophets without right. 

That is also because they have disobeyed God 

and persistently transgressed His covenant . 
3:ii3 -SlS-Yet know that not all of them are the same. 

For among the People of the Scripture, 

there is an upstanding community 

that recites the verses of God 

in the watches of the night. 

And they bow their faces down 

to the ground in worship before Him alone . 
3:ii4 They believe in God 

and in the coming Judgment of the Last Day. 

Moreover, they enjoin what is right 

and forbid what is wrong. 

And they hasten to exceed one another 

in good works. 

So these are among the righteous. 

3:ii5 Thus whatever good they do, 

never shall they be denied its reward . 

For God is all-knowing 

of those who are God-fearing. 

3:ii6 As for those who disbelieve, 

never shall their wealth, nor their children, 
avail them against God in anything at all . 
These are the Companions of the Fire of Hell . 
They shall abide therein forever. 

3:ii7 The parable of what they spend charitably 
in the life of this world is like that of a wind 
in which there is a bitter cold that afflicts — 
and thus destroys — the tillage of a people 
who have wronged their own souls.

We have, indeed, made clear to you

3:ii9 Yet there you are! You love them. 

But they do not love you. 

Moreover, you believe in every revealed Book. 
But as for them, when they meet you they say: 
We believe. 

But when they are alone, 

they bite their very fingertips out of rage

Say to them : Die in your rage! 
Indeed, God is all-knowing

when you went forth in the early morning

3:126 Nor does God occasion this promise of help

For victory comes only from God, 
the Overpowering One , the All- Wise. 

3:127 God made the believers victorious at Badr , 
so that He might cut off a leading flank 
of those who disbelieve, or subdue them, 
so that they would turn back in utter failure. 

3:128 You have nothing to say of this matter, 
O Prophet . 

Rather, it is for Him alone to determine 
whether to grant them repentance 
or to punish them.

they. remember God,

when they know it is wrong . 
3:136 It is these whose reward

3:140 If painful injury has touched you, 

then know that similar injury 

has certainly touched the people opposing you . 

And such are the days of life. 

By turns do We alternate them 

among humankind, 

that God may know those who believe, 

and that He may take to Himself martyrs 

from among you. 

For God does not love 

the wrongdoers who are godless in heart . 
3:i4i Moreover, in this way 

does God purge fault from the believers

for death in the cause of God , 

before actually confronting it in combat . 

So now you have truly seen it 

for yourselves and looked upon it.

And it is the thankful whom God shall reward. 
3:145 Nor does any soul ever die,

at the end of a predetermined term. 

So whoever desires the reward of this world,

fought many godly followers! 

Nor were they ever disheartened

Nor did they weaken. 

Nor did they seek to surrender.

and our excesses in our affairs. 

And set firm our feet.

3:150 Indeed, God alone is your patron. 
And He is the very best of supporters. 

3:i5i We shall cast terror in the hearts 
of those who disbelieve 
for having associated gods with God, 
for which He has not sent down any authority.

3.152 And truly God has fulfilled His promise to you 
of victory at Uhud . 

Behold! You were sweeping them away, 

with His permission — 

until, suddenly, you grew fainthearted. 

And you quarreled about the Prophet's order 

to hold your positions . 
And you disobeyed it — 
as soon as He had shown you what you love 

of spoils and worldly gain — 
among you being those who desire this world, 
and among you being those 
who desire the Hereafter. 
Thereupon, He turned you away 
from routing them, that He might test you. 
But truly He has pardoned you. 
For ever is God benevolent to the believers. 
3:153 -^-Behold! 

You were scrambling up the hillsides, fleeing —

from behind you, to stand firm. 
And God sees all things . 
Thus He requited you, 
with anguish upon anguish, 
so that you might learn not to grieve 
for whatever gain has escaped you, 
nor for whatever loss has stricken you. 
And God is all-aware of all that you do. 
3:154 Then He sent down upon you, 

after the anguish, a sense of security 
in the form of a sleepfulness 
that came upon a group of you. 
Yet a group of you 
kept worrying about themselves, 
having thoughts about God that are not true — 
like the thoughts of the days of ignorance, 
saying: 

Did we have any choice at all 
in undertaking this affair? 
Say to them : 

Indeed, the whole of every affair 

belongs to God alone . 

They conceal in their souls 

what they do not disclose to you, O Prophet . 

They say to themselves : 

Had we anything at all to do with this affair, 

we would not have fought and our companions 

would not have been killed here in this place! 

Say to them : 

Even if you had been 

in your own homes at that time , 

still those for whom death by killing 

was prescribed 

would have issued forth to their death place. 
And it is such, so that God may test you

as to what conviction is in your breast; 
and also that God may purge 
whatever sin is in your hearts. 
For God is all-knowing of all that is harbored 
within the breast of people . 
3:155 As for those among you 

who turned away from their duty 

the day the two armies met at Uhud , 

it was Satan who caused them to slip into error 

by means of something sinful 

they themselves have earned. 

Yet truly God has pardoned them. 

Indeed, God is all-forgiving, most forbearing. 

3:156 O you who believe! 

Do not be like those who disbelieve 

and who say of their brothers 

when they tread in the land 

or are on a campaign: 

Had they remained with us, 

they would not have died, 

and they would not have been killed. 
So does it appear, but only that God 

may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. 

For it is God alone 

who gives life and gives death. 

And God is all-seeing of all that you do. 
3:157 Thus, if you are killed 

in the path of God or die in it , 

most surely forgiveness from God 

and His mercy are far better 

than all that they who remain alive 

shall amass in the life of this world . 
3:158 Yet even if you should so die or be killed, 

still, you shall most surely

3:159 And so, O Muhammad , 

it was by the sheer mercy of God 

that you were lenient with them 

after their disobedience at Uhud . 

For had you been harsh and hard-hearted, 

then they would have disbanded 

from around you. 

So pardon them. And seek forgiveness for them. 

And take counsel with them 

concerning the community's affairs. 

Thereafter, if you become resolved 

on a matter, O Muhammad , 

then rely upon God alone . 

Indeed, God loves those 

who rely only on Him . 
3:i6o If God helps you, then none shall defeat you. 

But if ever He forsakes you, 

then who is it that can help you besides Him? 

So upon God alone let the believers rely. 
3:i6i It is not conceivable that a prophet 

would defraud. 

For whoever defrauds 

shall come on the Day of Resurrection 

with whatever he has defrauded. 

Then each soul shall be rendered in full 

what it has earned — 

and never shall they be wronged in the least . 
3:162 Is one who follows the good pleasure of God 
like one who brings upon himself 
the wrath of God,

with clear and miraculous proofs from God — 
along with revealed Writs, 
and the Illuminating Scripture. 

3:185 Every single soul shall taste death. 

And you shall all be rendered in full 

your rewards on the Day of Resurrection. 

So whoever is removed 

far from the Fire of Hell and is admitted 

to the Garden of Paradise , 

truly he has triumphed. 

For the life of this world is nothing 

but the mere enjoyment of a delusion. 
3:186 iiS-You shall most surely be tested 

in your wealth and in your persons. 

And you shall most surely hear 

many hurtful things 

from those who have been given the Scripture 
before you and from those 
who have associated gods with God. 
But if you remain patient and be God-fearing, 
great shall be your reward. 
For, indeed, these are among 
the foremost commandments of God 
that must be kept with diligent resolve. 

3:187 And behold! 

God took the covenant 

of those who were given the Scripture, saying : 
You shall make its message clear to the people. 
And you shall not suppress it. 
But they cast it behind their backs. 
And sold it for a small price. 
How woeful 

is what they have purchased with it !

3:188 Do not think that those who exult 

in abominable acts that they have done, 

and who love to be praised 

for what they have not done — 

do not think that they shall ever 

be safe from torment in this life . 

And for them in the Hereafter , 

there shall be a most painful torment. 
3:189 For to God alone belongs all dominion 

over the heavens and the earth. 

And God is powerful over all things. 
3:190 Indeed, in the creation 

of the heavens and the earth 

and in the alternation 

of the night and the daylight 

are signs of God's creative power 

for those who are endowed 

with discretion and understanding

3:i9i The ones who remember God with reverence 

while standing and while sitting 

and while lying on their sides; 

and who reflect on the creation 

of the heavens and the earth, 

saying : Our Lord! 

You have not created all this in vain. 
Highly exalted are You far above all ! 
So save us from the torment of the Fire of Hell . 
3:192 Our Lord! 

Indeed, whoever You commit 
to the Fire of Hell , 
truly You have disgraced him. 
And for the wrongdoers 
who are godless in heart , 
there shall not be any helpers

3:193 Our Lord! 

We have heard a caller calling to faith, saying : 

Believe in your Lord! So we have believed. 

Our Lord! Forgive us our sins. 

And absolve us of our misdeeds. 

And take our souls 

while we are among the virtuous. 
3:194 Our Lord! 

And give us what You have promised us 

through Your messengers. 

And do not disgrace us 

on the Day of Resurrection. 

Indeed, You do not fail to fulfill 

the promise You make . 
3:195 Thus their Lord has answered them: 

I do not neglect the deeds of anyone of you 

who works, whether male or female. 

You are of one another. 

So those who have emigrated 

for the sake of God 

and who have been expelled from their homes 
and who have suffered harm in My path 
and who fought against persecution 
and were killed — 

I shall absolve them all of their misdeeds. 
Moreover, I shall admit them 
into Gardens beneath which rivers flow — 
a reward from God. 

And with God is the most excellent reward. 

3:196 Do not let the unrestrained mobility 

of the disbelievers in the land delude you.

And all that is with God 

is most surely far better for the virtuous. 
3:199 Now, indeed, 

there are among the People of the Scripture 

those who believe in God 

and in what has been sent down to you 

and in what has been sent down to them, 

humbling themselves before God. 

They do not sell the revealed signs of God 

for a small price. 

For these, their reward is with their Lord in full . 
Indeed, God is swift in reckoning.

And have outlasting patience. 
And be ever at the ready. 
And be ever God-fearing,

/ 176 VERSES / REVEALED AT MADINAH 



Al-Nisa' 



IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE ALL-MERCIFUL, THE MERCY-GIVING 



4:1 O humankind! 

Be ever God-fearing, conscious of your Lord 

who created all of you from a single soul — 

and from it created its mate, 

and from them both spread abroad 

many men and women. 

So fear God, 

in whose name you ask consideration 
of one another. 

And, therefore, be dutiful to kindred. 

For, indeed, ever is God vigilant 

over all of you. 
4:2 Moreover, restore to orphans their wealth 
when they attain maturity . 

Nor shall you substitute your tainted wealth 

for their wholesome wealth . 

Nor shall you consume their wealth 

with your own wealth, 

for it is, indeed, a great offense. 
4:3 Thus if you men fear 

that in marrying orphaned females 

you may not act with justice, 

then marry other women

that seem good to you — 

up to two, or three, or four. 
Yet if you fear that you will not be equitable 

between them , then marry only one. 
Or consider those 

whom your hands may rightfully attain to. 

This is most befitting 

to ensure that you will not be unfair. 

Moreover, give the women whom you marry 

their rightful marriage present, unconditionally. 

Yet if they are pleased 

to give something of it to you, 

then enjoy it salubriously, pleasantly. 

But do not give those 

who are mentally incompetent your wealth, 

for God has assigned you 

to maintain this yourselves . 

Rather, provide for them from it. 

And clothe them. 

And say to them 

a gracious and comforting word. 
Therefore, test the judgment of the orphans 
in your care , 

until they reach the age of marriage. 

And when you recognize 

mature judgment in them, 

then hand over their wealth to them. 

Nor shall you consume it in wasteful spending, 

or in haste, 

for fear they will grow up and claim it . 
Moreover, 

if the one who is the orphan's guardian is rich, 
then let him abstain from it entirely . 
But if one is poor, then let him consume of it 
only in accordance with what is right.

And when you hand over their wealth to them, 
then bring witnesses before them to attest to it . 
Yet sufficient is God as a just reckoner. 

4:7 For men, there shall be a portion 
of what parents and nearest relatives 
leave behind in death . 
And for women, there shall be a portion 
of what parents and nearest relatives 
leave behind . 

Whatever there is of it, be it little or much, 
there shall be 

an obligatory apportionment made . 
4:8 Moreover, when close relatives, 

or orphans, or the indigent 

attend the division of inheritance , 

provide for them out of it. 

Moreover, say to them 

a gracious and comforting word. 
4:9 And let those, who were they themselves 

to leave behind them helpless children — 

for whom they would be fearful — 

beware of God ! 

Thus let them fear God 

and say a forthright word 

to uphold the inheritance rights 

of orphans and others .

the wealth of the orphan unjustly 

are only consuming fire into their bellies. 

For they shall roast in a flaming fire in Hell .

But if there are only females — two or more — 

then to them go two-thirds 

of what he who is deceased leaves behind. 

But if there is only one daughter , 

then to her goes one-half. 

And as to his parents, to each one of them, 

goes one-sixth of what he leaves behind, 
if he has children. 
But if he does not have children, 
and his only heirs are his parents, 
then to his mother goes one-third. 
Yet if he has brothers or sisters , 
then to his mother goes one-sixth, 
after any testament he bequeaths 

is apportioned or any debt is paid. 

Behold! 

They are your parents and your children. 
Yet you do not know 
which one of them is rightfully closer 
as a benefactor to you. 
This injunction of inheritance 
is an obligation from God. 
Indeed, ever is God all-knowing, all- wise. 

•&gt;|r And as to you men , there goes one-half 
of what your wives leave behind , 
if they do not have children. 
But if they have children, 
then to you goes one-fourth 
of what they leave behind ,

is apportioned or any debt is paid .

if you do not have children. 

But if you have children, 

then to them goes one-eighth 

of what you leave behind, 

after any testament you bequeath 

is apportioned or any debt is paid . 

And if a man or a woman is to be inherited 
by a non-lineal heir 

while having a uterine brother or sister, 
then to each one of them goes one-sixth. 
But if they number more than two, 
then they all share equally in one-third,

you shall call against them

from among yourselves. 

Thus if these so bear witness, 

then confine such women 

within designated homes 

until death takes them, 

or until God decrees in His Book 

a different means of discipline for them. 
4:16 As to the two parties among you 

who commit this offense , 

you shall punish them both. 

Then if they repent and do righteousness, 

turn aside from them 

and punish them no more . 

Indeed, ever is God 

all-relenting, mercy-giving. 
4:17 Yet there is acceptance of repentance with God 

only for those who do evil out of ignorance 

then repent soon after. 

It is to such as these whom God 

will grant repentance. 

And ever is God all-knowing, all-wise. 
4:18 But there is no repentance for those 

who continue to do great sins — 

until, when death approaches one of them, 

he says: 

I do, indeed, repent now! 

Nor is there repentance for those who die

It is not lawful for you 

to inherit like mere objects 

the women of your deceased; 

nor to hold them forcibly 

in order to have their wealth . 

Nor shall you impede them from marriage , 

in order for you to take away anything 

of whatever possessions you have given them, 

except when they commit flagrant indecency. 

So consort with them only in accordance 

with what is right and honorable . 

And should you come to detest them 

after marrying them, then , behold: 

It may be that you detest something 

and God will place therein much goodness. 
4:20 Moreover, 

if you intend a substitution of one wife 

in place of another wife 

and you have given one of them 

as much as a heap of gold in dowry , 

then you shall not take back 

anything at all from it. 

Will you take it by way of calumny 

and clear sin? 
4:21 And how could you take it back 

when you have consorted intimately 

with each other, 

and when they have taken from you 
a most solemn covenant of marriage ? 

4:22 Moreover, you shall not marry those women 
whom your fathers have married before .

And God knows best about your faith.

So regarding your handmaids, 

you may marry them,

But give them their full dowry compensation,

They are to be chaste women

Indeed, that to which God exhorts you 
is most excellent. 

Indeed, ever is God all-hearing, all-seeing. 

4:59 O you who believe! You shall obey God. 

And you shall obey the Messenger 

and those in authority among you. 

And if you should ever dispute over anything, 

then refer it to God and the Messenger, 

if truly you believe in God 

and in the coming Judgment of the Last Day. 

That is the best and fairest resolution 
to your conflicts . 
4:60 Have you not seen the feckless example 

of those who allege 

that they have believed in the revelation 
that has been sent down to you 
and in the revelation

that has been sent down before you? 
They desire to submit 
to the judgment of false deities, 
while they have been commanded 
to disbelieve in them. 

Yet Satan desires to mislead them far astray. 

So when it is said to them: 

Come to the decree that God has sent down, 

and to the judgment of the Messenger, 

you see the hypocrites — 

so very averse to this — 

adamantly turn themselves and others 

away from you, O Prophet . 

How then shall it be 

when an affliction strikes them 

for what evil their own hands have advanced, 

whereafter they come to you lamenting, 

swearing by God, we intended nothing 

but to bring about goodwill and conciliation? 

These are the ones whom God well knows 

what is lurking in their hearts. 

So turn aside from them. Yet admonish them. 

And say to them a cogent word 

about the remedy for their souls. 

For never have We sent any messenger 

but to be obeyed by the people , 

with the permission of God. 

Thus, if after wronging themselves 

they had come to you, O Muhammad, 

and sought the forgiveness of God — 

and had the Messenger, as well, 

sought forgiveness for them — 

they most surely would have found God 

all-relenting, mercy-giving. 

But no!

By your Lord, they will not truly believe 
until they make you the judge 
of whatever disputes break out among them, 
finding, then, 

no sense of constraint within themselves, 
as to complying with what you have decided — 
submitting to it willingly 
with a pure submission. 
4:66 And had We ever prescribed for them: 
You are to kill the godless wrongdoers 
among yourselves! Or: 
You are to leave your own dwellings 
forevermore ! 

They would not have done it, 
except for a few of them. 
Yet had they done 
what they were admonished to do, 
it would have been best for them 
and far stronger in setting firm their faith . 
For, then, We would have given them, 
out of Our own bounty, 
a magnificent reward in the Hereafter . 
Moreover, 

We would have certainly guided them 
upon a straight way in this life . 
For whoever obeys God and the Messenger, 
then it is these who shall be 
with those upon whom God 
has bestowed grace — 
among the prophets and the truthful 
and the martyrs and the righteous 
in the Hereafter . 

And most excellent are they as companions!

Take due precaution against all belligerents . 

Then advance against them in detachments.

there are among you those who tarry. 

Then if an affliction strikes you believers, 

the likes of one who tarried says: 

Truly, God has bestowed grace upon me, 

since I was not present with them in defeat . 
4:73 But whenever a great triumph and bounty 

comes to you from God, 

he most surely says in lament —

4:76 Those who believe fight in the path of God. 

And those who disbelieve 

fight in the path of false deities. 

So fight the allies of Satan. 

Indeed, Satan's plot is ever weak. 
4:77 Have you not seen the example 

of those to whom it was previously said: 

Stay your hands from fighting 

and duly establish the Prayer 

and give the Zakat-Charity? 

Yet when fighting was prescribed for them, 

at once, a group of them 

feared the people they were to fight 

as they should fear God — 

or with an even greater fear. 

And so they said: Our Lord! 

Why now have You prescribed fighting for us? 

If only You had deferred it for us 

to a near term! 

Say to them : 

The enjoyment of this world is little, 
while the Hereafter is best 
for those who are God-fearing. 
And never shall you be wronged even a whit. 
4:78 Wherever you may be, death shall overtake you 
at the pre-ordained time — 
even if you are in lofty towers. 
Yet if any good comes to them, 
they say in their wavering hearts : 
This is from God! 
But if any harm strikes them, 
they say: 

This is from you, O Muhammad !

All things are decreed from God. 
What is with these people 
that they can hardly understand any discourse? 
4:79 Whatever good has come to any one of you, 
it is from God. 

And whatever harm has stricken you, 
it is from your own self. 
Thus have We sent you, O Muhammad, 
as a Messenger to all people 
to convey this message . 
And sufficient is God as a witness to this . 
4:80 Whoever obeys the Messenger 
has thus obeyed God. 

But as to whoever turns away from God — 
then know that We have not sent you, 
O Muhammad,

4:8i Moreover, they say to you: 

We pledge obedience!

a group of them deliberate by night 

to do other than what you say.

what they deliberate on by night. 

So turn away from them. 

And rely on God alone . 

For sufficient is God as a guardian. 
4:82 Will they not, then, reflect 

on the meaning of the Quran? 

If it had been from other than God,

would know of it and act accordingly . 
And had it not been 

for the grace of God upon you, and His mercy, 
all but a few of you believers 
would have followed the promptings of Satan. 
4:84 So fight on against aggression 
in the path of God, undaunted . 
You are not accountable, O Prophet, 
for other than yourself. 

Yet urge the believers on to fearlessness, as well 

It may be that God 

will hold back the mighty power 

of those who have disbelieved. 

For God is far greater in mighty power 

and far greater in chastisement. 

4:85 Whoever intercedes in a matter 

with benevolent intercession, 

there shall be for him 

a portion of its Heavenly reward . 

And whoever intercedes with evil intercession, 

there shall be for him a share of its sin . 

And ever is God an able watcher over all things. 
4:86 Moreover, whenever you are greeted 

with a salutation, then return the greeting 

with an even better salutation. 

Or, at the least, return it in kind .

a just reckoner of all things.

And who is more truthful in word than God? 
■SiS-What is with you, then, 
that you believers are of two parties, 
divided in opinion regarding the hypocrites, 
while God has subverted them 
for all the evil works they have earned? 
Do you wish to guide those

And whomever God leaves to stray,

They would love that you disbelieve,

Therefore, take no allies from among them

So take from them no ally, nor supporter. 
Excepted are those

who seek a promise of security from you,

seek to have security from their own people.

Did we not have the advantage over you 

and shield you against the believers? 

Indeed, God shall judge between you all

And never will God 

make a way for the disbelievers 

to utterly overcome the true believers. 
4:142 Indeed, the hypocrites seek to deceive God. 

But it is He who causes them to be deceived. 

Whenever they stand for the Prayer, 

they stand lazily, for they merely desire 

to show themselves before people. 

Nor do they remember God thereafter 

except a little — 
4:143 wavering between the two sides, 

belonging neither to these- nor to those. 

Yet whomever God leaves to stray, 

never will you find for him 

a rightly guided way. 

4:144 O you who believe! 

You shall not take the disbelievers as allies 

instead of the believers. 

Do you desire, in doing this ,

as to your faithlessness ? 
4:145 Indeed, the hypocrites shall be

And never will you find for them 

any helper to deliver them . 
4:146 Excepted are those who repent, 

and set their affairs aright, 

and hold fast to faith in God, 

and make their religion sincere to God alone 

Such as these shall be ever with the believers. 

And God shall give the believers 

a magnificent reward. 

4:147 What would God attain by tormenting you 

if you give thanks to Him 

and truly believe in Him ? 

And ever is God all-thankful, all-knowing. 
4:148 -&gt;irGod does not love overt expression 

of offensive discourse, unless it be in redress 

by one who has been wronged. 

And, indeed, ever is God

or conceal it, 

or pardon an evil offense against you — 
then know that ever is God 
all-pardoning, almighty. 
4:150 Those who disbelieve in God 
and His messengers, 
and who desire to separate 
between belief in God 
and belief in all His messengers, saying: 
We believe in some. 
But we disbelieve in others! —

to pursue a deceptive path between them — 
4:i5i it is these who are, in truth, the disbelievers. 

And We have made ready for the disbelievers 

a disgracing torment. 
4:152 But all those who believe in God 

and His messengers — 

not differentiating in faith 

between any of them — 

to those He shall give their full rewards. 

And ever is God all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 

4:153 The People of the Scripture ask you, 
O Prophet, to bring down to them 
an inscribed book from Heaven. 
Truly, they have asked Moses 
for something greater than this. 
They said: 

Show us God openly, before our very eyes ! 
Then, suddenly, the thunderbolt seized them 
for their wrongdoing. 

Then they took the Golden Calf for worship 
after the clear and miraculous proofs 

of God had come to them. 
Then We pardoned this. 
Moreover, We gave Moses 
clear evidence against idolatry . 
4:154 For We lifted Mount Tur above them 

as a warning for defying their covenant. 
And thereafter We said to them: 
Enter through the gate of Jerusalem 
bowing down in all humility. 
But they defied it . 
And thereafter We said to them, 
You shall commit no violation in the Sabbath. 

But they defied it .

And thereafter We took from them 
a most solemn covenant. But they defied it . 
4:155 Thus for breaking their own covenant; 

and for their disbelief in the signs of God; 
and for their killing of the prophets 
without any right; 
and for their saying: 
Our hearts are encased 
against farther Revelation — 
they were condemned . 
Rather, as to their hearts, 

God has set a seal upon them for their unbelief. 

For they do not believe, except for a little. 
4:156 Moreover they were condemned 

for their unbelief; 

and for their utterance 

of an enormous calumny against Mary; 
4:157 and for their saying: 

Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, 

Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of God! 

However, they did not kill him. 

Nor did they crucify him. 

Rather, it was made to appear to them as so. 

And as to those who are in dispute 

with regard to him and the crucifixion , 

they themselves remain in doubt about it. 

They have no sure knowledge of it, 

except the following of mere conjecture. 

Yet for a certainty they did not kill him! 
4:158 Rather, God has raised him to Himself. 

And ever is God overpowering, all-wise. 
4:159 And there is not a single one 

of the People of the Scripture 

save that every last one of them 

shall most surely believe in him

as the Messiah before his death. 
Moreover, on the Day of Resurrection, 
he himself shall be a witness against them. 

4:i6o Because of the wrongdoing 

perpetrated by those of Jewry, 
We have made forbidden to them 
wholesome foods 

previously made lawful to them — 
and also because of their barring 

of so many people from the way of God; 
4:i6i and for their taking of usury, 

though they were forbidden to do it; 
and for their consuming 
the wealth of the people by false means. 
Moreover, We have prepared 
for the disbelievers among them 
a most painful torment in the Hereafter . 
4:162 But those among them 

who are well-grounded in knowledge, 
as well as the true believers, 
believe in this revelation 
that has been sent down to you, 

O Muhammad, 

and in the Scripture that has been sent down 
to the prophets who came before you — 
as do the steadfast in establishing the Prayer, 
and the givers of the Zakat-Charity, 
and the believers in God 

and in the coming Judgment of the Last Day. 
It is to these that We shall give 
a magnificent reward. 
4:163 ^Indeed, We have given revelation to you, 
O Muhammad, 

even as We gave revelation to Noah

and the prophets after him — 

and as We have given revelation to Abraham, 

and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, 

and to the prophets of the Tribes of Israel , 

and to Jesus, and Job, and Jonah, 

and Aaron, and Solomon. 

And We gave David the Psalms as a revelation . 
4:164 Thus there are messengers 

of whom We have told you before 
and other messengers 
of whom We have not told you. 
And it is true 

that God spoke directly to Moses — 

His very word, indeed! 
4:165 They were messengers — 

bearers of glad tidings and forewarners — 

so that after the coming of the messengers 

people would have no argument before God 

to justify their misdeeds . 

Indeed, ever is God overpowering, all- wise. 
4:166 Yet if they belie you , God bears witness 

to what He has sent down to you, 

O Muhammad : 

He has sent it down with His knowledge. 

And all the angels so bear witness. 

Yet sufficient is God as a witness to this. 
4:167 So as to those who disbelieve 

and bar people from the path of God, 

they have truly strayed far astray. 
4:168 Indeed, those who disbelieve and do wrong, 

God shall not forgive them! 

Nor shall He guide them along any path — 
4:169 except the path to Hell, 

wherein they shall abide, forever and ever. 

And that, for God, is ever easy.

that , indeed, to God belongs

And ever is God all-knowing, all-wise. 

4:i7i O People of the Scripture! 

Do not exceed the bounds of revealed faith 

in the creed of your religion. 

Nor say about God other than the truth. 

Indeed, the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, 

is only God's messenger; 

and was created by His word 

that He cast to Mary; 

and was a spirit that issued forth 

by a command from Him to be . 

So believe in God and all His messengers. 

And do not say: 

Three gods in a Trinity ! 

Desist! It is better for you. 

Indeed, God is but One God. 

Highly exalted is He above having a son! 

To Him belongs all that is in the heavens 

and all that is in the earth. 

And sufficient is God as a guardian.

But as for those who become disdainful

He shall torment them

And they shall not find for themselves,

4:174 O humankind! 

Truly decisive proof of the true religion

And herein have We sent down to you

He shall admit them to a mercy of His own, 

and to His favor. 

And He shall guide them to Himself, 
along a straight way of salvation . 

4:176 They who believe 

seek an additional ruling from you, 
concerning inheritance, O Muhammad . 
Say to them : 

God Himself gives you a ruling 

regarding one who has only a non-lineal heir: 

If a person perishes, having no children, 

but he has a sister, then to her goes one-half 

of what he leaves behind . 

And he alone inherits her

But if there are two surviving sisters,

of what he leaves behind . 

Yet if there are surviving siblings, 

men and women, 

then to the male goes a portion 

like that of two females. 

God clarifies this for you, 

so that you may not go astray.

Fulfill all contracts, treaties, and covenants

God decrees these terms: 
Lawful for you as food are grazing beasts — 
excluding what shall be presently 
recited to you as specifically forbidden, 
and provided you do not make lawful 
the hunting of game 

while you are in the state of pilgrim sanctity. 
Indeed, God decrees whatever He so wills. 

5:2 O you who believe! 
As to the Pilgrimage : 
Do not violate the prescribed rituals 
and waymarks of God therein — 
neither in relation to the sacred month 
in which it occurs ; 

nor in relation to the animal you bring along 
as a charitable-offering of sacrifice ; 
nor in relation to sacrificial animals for charity . 
so marked by their bearing of garlands;

nor in relation to those pilgrims 
headed for the Sacred House in Makkah 
seeking bounty from their Lord 
and in quest of His good pleasure. 
But when you lawfully end 
the state of pilgrim sanctity , 
then you may resume hunting game. 
Yet you shall not let your feelings 
of detestation toward a people 
who have previously barred you 
from the Sacred Mosque 

cause you to commit aggression against them . 

Rather, you shall help one another 

to virtuousness, and to the fear of God. 

But you shall not help one another 

to sin and to aggression. 

Therefore, fear God. 

Indeed, God is severe in punishment 

for the breaking of His covenant. 

As to specific dietary prohibitions : 
Forbidden to you 
is the consumption of carrion, 
and blood, and the flesh of swine, 
and that over which 

other than the name of God has been invoked, 

and what has been strangled, 

and what has been beaten to death, 

and what has fallen to its death, 

and what has been gored to death, 

and what has been eaten by a predator —

before it dies —

Thus the food of those

And your food is lawful for them. 
Moreover, lawful for you in matrimony 
are chaste women from among the believers 
and chaste women from among those 
who have been given the Scripture 
before you — 

provided you have given them 

their full dowry compensation in marriage — 

not to commit fornication, 

nor to take them as lovers. 

Yet whoever belies faith in God , 

his good work 

shall assuredly be rendered utterly futile. 

And he shall be, in the Hereafter, 

among the losers of an everlasting Paradise . 

O you who believe! 

When you rise for the Prayer, 

wash your faces, and your hands to the elbows. 

And wipe your heads with wet hands . 

And wash your feet to the ankles. 

And when again you become ritually unclean, 

then cleanse yourselves thus . 

But if you become sick or are on a journey, 

or if one of you comes forth 

from the place of relieving oneself, 

or if you have touched women intimately

had previously taken the solemn covenant 

of the Children of Israel. 

And We raised up from among them 

twelve leaders. 

And God said to them : 

Indeed, I am with you. 

Assuredly, if you but duly establish the Prayer

I shall most surely absolve you of your misdeeds. 
And I shall most surely admit you

But whoever among you disbelieves after this 
shall have truly strayed from the even way. 
5:13 Thus for breaking their own covenant, 
We cursed them. 

And We made their hearts harden. 
For they altered the words of the Scripture, 
omitting them from their contexts. 
Thus they forgot a cardinal portion

He creates whatever He so wills. 
For God is powerful over all things.

We are the children of God,

Why, then, does He punish you for your sins? 

Rather, you are but human beings

He forgives whomever He so wills. 

And He punishes whomever He so wills. 

For to God alone belongs

5:30 Yet still his brother's soul prompted him

Thus he became among the losers

to show him how to bury 

the corpse of his brother. 

He said: Oh, woe to me! 

Am I not even able to be like this crow, 

so as to bury the corpse of my own brother? 

And thus did he become of the regretful. 
5:32 Because of this, 

We did prescribe for the Children of Israel 

that whoever kills a person — 

except in punishment 

for the killing of another person, 

or for the spreading of dire corruption 

in the earth — 

it shall be reckoned as though 

he has killed all humankind. 

And whoever saves a life,

But they will never get out of it. 
Rather, for them 

there is oniy an enduring torment. 

5:38 As for the male thief and the female thief 
among yourselves , 
cut off their hands as a recompense 
for what evil they have earned, 
and as a chastisement of deterrence from God. 
And God is overpowering, all- wise. 
5:39 But whoever repents after his wrongdoing, 
and sets things aright, 

then, indeed, God shall grant him repentance. 
Indeed, God is most forgiving, mercy-giving. 
5:40 Do you not know that to God alone belongs 
all dominion over the heavens and the earth? 
He punishes whomever He so wills. 
And He forgives whomever He so wills. 
For God is powerful over all things. 

5:4i -JifO Messenger! 

Do not let those factions 

bent on racing one another into unbelief 

grieve you: 

Those hypocrites who say with their mouths: 
We believe! 

while their hearts do not believe; 

and those among Jewry 

who listen eagerly to lies about you ,

of another group among their people

in the words of the Scripture , 

after their contexts have been set, 

by saying to one another 

when seeking your prophetic arbitration : 

If you are given this 

favorable ruling by the Messenger , then take it. 

But if you are not given it, 

then beware of accepting his ruling. 

Do not grieve for them. 

For one whose trial God intends, 

you shall never acquire for him 

any measure of saving grace from God. 

These are the ones whose hearts 

God does not intend to purify. 

For them there shall be in this world disgrace. 

And for them there shall be in the Hereafter 

a great torment awaiting . 
5:42 They listen eagerly to lies. 

They devour ill-gotten gains. 

Thus, if ever they should come to you again 

for arbitration , then judge between them 

or turn away from them. 

And should you turn away from them, 

they shall never harm you in any way. 

Yet if you judge between them, 

then judge between them with justice. 

Indeed, God loves those who are just. 
5:43 And how is it that they seek your judgment 

while the Torah itself is with them? 

In it is the ruling from God which they seek . 

Yet even when you render 

the Torah's own judgment , 

still, after this, they turn away from it ! 

Therefore, these are not truly believers. 
5:44 Indeed, it is We, Ourself,

who sent down the Torah. 
In it there is guidance and light. 
With it the prophets, 
who submitted themselves to God , 
made judgments for Jewry, 
as did the rabbis and the scribes; 
for they had been entrusted 
to preserve the Scripture of God — 
and to this trust they were mindful witnesses. 
God said to them: 

Henceforth, you shall not fear people! 

Rather, you shall fear Me. 

Nor shall you sell My revealed signs 

for a small price. 

And whoever does not rule 

by what God has sent down — 

then such as these are the disbelievers. 
5:45 Now, in it We prescribed for them: 

A life for a life, and an eye for an eye, 

and a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, 

and a tooth for a tooth, 

and retribution for wounds. 

Yet whoever would forgo this, out of charity, 

then it will be taken as an atonement 

for the one who has suffered injury . 

But whoever does not rule 

by what God has sent down — 

then such as these are the wrongdoers, 
godless in heart . 
5:46 And after the prophets of Israel , 

We sent following upon their traces 

Jesus, son of Mary, 

as a confirmation of the truth 

that had preceded him in the law of the Torah. 

Moreover, We gave him the Evangel —

in which there is guidance and light — 

as a confirmation of the truth 

that had preceded him 

in the law of the Torah, 

along with further guidance 

and inspired admonition for the God-fearing. 
5:47 Then let the people of the Evangel 

rule by what God has sent down in it. 

For whoever does not rule 

by what God has sent down — 

then such as these are the ungodly. 
5:48 Now We have sent down to you, 

O Muhammad, the Scripture of the Quran 

with the truth, 

as a confirmation of all the Scripture 

that preceded it — 

and as a guardian over it 

to preserve divine guidance . 
So judge between them 
by what God has sent down. 
And do not follow their whims 
over what has come to you 

as a clear statement of the truth. 

For each faith-community among you 

We have appointed a Divine Law 

and a way of life. 

And had God so willed, 

He would have made all of you 

one faith -community without choice . 

But He has intended to test you 

in what He has given you. 

Thus race with one another to good works! 

To God is your return — all of you. 

He shall then tell you the truth 

about all that you have been disputing.

5:49 And thus, judge between them 
by what God has sent down. 
Nor are you to follow their whims. 
Yet be ware of them! 

Or else they may tempt you from adhering 

to some of what God has sent down to you. 

So if they turn away 

from the commandments of God , 

then know that God only intends to afflict them 

for some of their sins. 

And, assuredly, 

many of the people are, indeed, ungodly. 
5:50 Is it, then, the judgment of pagan ignorance 
that they seek? 

Yet who renders a fairer judgment than God 
to a people who would have certainty of faith ? 

5:5i "Sfc O you who believe! 

Do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. 

They are allies one to another. 

And whoever among you 

takes them as allies, then he is of them. 

Indeed, God does not guide 

the wrongdoing people 

who are godless in heart . 
5:52 Yet you see the hypocrites , 

those in whose doubting hearts 

there is a sickness, 

rushing to ally themselves with them, 

saying to one another : 

We must do this for fear of defeat, 

for we fear that a bad turn of fortune 

will afflict us.

Then will the hypocrites

within themselves. 
5:53 For those who believe will then say: 
Are these traitors 
the same ones who swore by God 
with the utmost of their vows 
that they were most surely with you? 
Utterly futile are their good works with God ! 
Thus have they become losers 
of an everlasting Paradise . 

5:54 O you who believe! 

Should any of you turn back from his religion, 

then know that God shall bring forth instead 

a people He will love and who will love Him — 

humble with the believers, 

mighty with the disbelievers, 

striving hard in the path of God, 

and having no fear of the blame of any 

who would cast blame on their religion . 

That is the bounty of God. 

He gives it to whomever He so wills. 

And God is all-encompassing, all-knowing. 
5:55 Indeed, your ally is none but God,

those who duly establish the Prayer, 

and give the Zakat-Charity,

awaiting with God that is far worse than that 

which you do to us? 

It is the punishment 

of those whom God has cursed, 

and with whom He is wrathful, 

and out of whom He made apes and swine, 

and who worship false deities.

Assuredly, We would have absolved them 
of their misdeeds. 
And, assuredly, 

We would have admitted them forever

Indeed, God, Himself, is the Messiah, 
son of Mary. 

while the Messiah himself said: 

O Children of Israel: 

Worship God, my Lord and your Lord!

the Garden of Paradise . 

And his abode shall be the Fire of Hell . 

And for the wrongdoers 
who are godless in heart , 

there shall not be any helpers 
to deliver them from it . 
5:73 Truly they have disbelieved who say 

that God is the third of three in a trinity , 

while there is no other god but the One God. 

And if they do not desist 

from what they are saying, 

assuredly a most painful torment 

will strike those of them who thus disbelieve. 
5:74 Will they not, then, repent to God 

and seek His forgiveness,

will distress you with further obligation .

God has pardoned of it what has past . 

For God is all-forgiving, most forbearing. 
5:102 Truly people before you

O Jesus, son of Mary! 
Can your Lord send down to us

He said: 

Fear God, if, indeed, you are believers! 
5:ii3 They said: 

We wish to eat from it

5:114 Jesus, son of Mary, said: 

0 God! Our Lord! 

Send down to us a table-spread from Heaven 
to be a feast for us — 
for the first of us and the last of us — 
and to be a sure sign from You 
of my prophethood . 
And provide for us always , 
for You are the best of providers. 
5:ii5 God said: 

Indeed, I shall send it down to you. 

But whoever of you disbelieves thereafter, 

1 will punish him with a punishment 

such as I shall not punish anyone else with 
among all the people of the world . 

5:ii6 Thus it is then, 

on the Day of Judgment , when God shall say: 

O Jesus, son of Mary: 

Did you say to the people: 

Take me and my mother both 

as gods apart from God? 

Jesus shall say: 

Highly exalted are You far above this ! 
It was not for me to say 
what I had no right to say . 
If I had said it, 

then, truly, You would have known it. 
You know what is in my soul, 
and I do not know what is in Yourself. 
Indeed, it is You, 
You alone who are all-knowing 
of all the realms of the unseen.

You have commanded me: 
Worship God alone , my Lord and your Lord!

IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE ALL-MERCIFUL, THE MERCY-GIVING 



6:i All praise is for God alone , 

who created the heavens and the earth 
and made the enveiling darkness 
and the unveiling light. 
Yet those who disbelieve 
assign equals to their Lord! 

6:2 He is the One 

who created all of you out of mud. 
Then He decreed a term 
for human life on earth . 
And a stated term for the Day of Judgment 
is with Him alone . 
Yet those of you who disbelieve 
doubt that it is nearing . 

6:3 Moreover, He is God 

in the heavens and in the earth. 

He knows your secrets 

and what you make public. 

And He knows all the good and the evil 

that you are earning.

6:4 Yet not a single sign 

of God's Oneness comes to them, 
from the revealed and natural 
signs of their Lord, 

but that they who disbelieve turn away from it. 

6:5 So truly, they have willfully denied the truth 

when it came to them from God . 

And thus the revealed tidings 

of the just recompense 

that they are mocking shall come to them. 
6:6 Have they not considered 

how many a disbelieving generation 

before them We have destroyed — 

whom We firmly established in the earth, 

such as We have not established you, 

having sent down upon them of old 

the blessing of rain from heaven in abundance, 

thus causing the great rivers 

to run beneath them at their feet ? 

Then We destroyed them for their sins 

and brought forth after each of them 

another generation. 
6.7 And had We sent down to you, 

O Muhammad, 

a revealed Book inscribed on parchment, 
so that they could feel it 
with their very own hands, 
those who disbelieve 
would still most surely say: 
This is nothing but manifest sorcery!

If only an angel had been sent down 
with Muhammad to confirm him! 
But had We sent down an angel,

it would have been with their destruction, 
and the matter would have been concluded. 
Then they would not have been reprieved 
for a single moment . 
6:9 And even if We had sent 

other than a human messenger 
and made him an angel, 
We, assuredly, would have made him 
appear like a man. 
Yet, assuredly, by this 

We would have made confounding for them 

what they now make confounding 
for themselves . 
6:io And very truly, messengers before you 

were mocked, O Muhammad . 

But those who scoffed at them 

were encompassed by the very punishment 

they used to mock.

Journey in the earth,

To whom belongs 

all that is in the heavens and the earth? 

And say in answer : To God alone . 
He has prescribed for Himself mercy. 

Yet, most surely, 

He shall, indeed, gather all of you

6:13 Moreover, to Him alone 

belongs all that dwells in stillness

And He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. 
6:14 Say to them : 

Shall I take a patron other than God, 

the Sole Originator 

of the heavens and the earth, 

while it is He who feeds and is not fed? 

Say to them, O Muhammad : 

Indeed, I have been commanded 

to be the foremost of those 

who have willingly submitted themselves 
as a Muslim to God alone . 

Moreover, I have been commanded : 

You shall not be of those 

who associate gods with God. 
6:15 Say to them : 

Indeed, I fear — were I to disobey my Lord — 

the torment of an awesome Day! 
6:16 Whoever is turned away from the torment 

that Day, 

then He has truly shown him mercy. 

And that is the manifest triumph! 
6:i7 Yet should God touch you with harm, 

there is none who can remove it but Him. 

But if He touches you with good,

And say in answer : 

God Himself is a witness between me and you. 
Moreover, this Quran has been revealed to me, 
as a means with which to forewarn you 
and whomever it reaches 
of His n earing Judgment . 
Do you, indeed, bear witness 
that there are other gods with God? 
Say to them : I shall not bear such witness! 
Say: Indeed, He is One God alone . 
And, indeed, I am innocent of worshipping 
all that you associate as gods with God. 

6:20 Regarding those to whom 
We gave the Scripture, 
they recognize the divine message 
of this Prophet 

as they recognize their own children. 

These are the ones 

who have utterly lost their souls,

6:21 For who does a greater wrong 

than one who forges lies against God 

or belies His revealed signs? 

Indeed, the godless wrongdoers 

shall not succeed. 
6:22 For on the Day of Judgment 

We shall assemble them all together. 

We shall then say to those 

who associated gods with God: 

Where, now , are your associate-gods 

that you used to allege? 
6:23 Thereupon, they shall have nothing else 

in their hour of trial, but to say:

SURAH 6 I AL-AN C AM - CATTLE

By God, our Lord! 

Never were we of those 

who associated gods with God! 
6:24 Look how even then 

they shall lie about themselves! 

For all the false gods that they used to forge 

shall have strayed from them. 
6:25 Yet even now 

as you recite this Quran to them , 

among them are those 

who listen to you with malicious intent, 

pursuing their whims . 

Therefore, We have placed sheaths 

over their ill-inclined hearts, 

so that they may no longer understand it, 

and in their ears, an utter deafness. 

For even if they were to see 

every natural and revealed sign 

of Heavenly truth, 

still they would not believe in it. 

Thus when they come to you 

to argue with you, those who disbelieve say: 

This is nothing but tales of the ancients! 
6:26 Moreover, they forbid other people 

from listening to it. 

And they draw themselves away from it. 
Yet they are destroying none but themselves, 
though they are not aware of it . 
6:27 And if only you could now see 
when they shall be set upon 
the brink of the Fire of Hell , 
and they shall say: Oh, woe to us! 
If only we could be returned to the world 
and not deny the signs 
of the Oneness of our Lord

6:28 Rather, what they previously used to conceal 
shall manifest itself before them. 
Yet even if they were to be so returned 
to the world , they would revert to all the ways 
that have been forbidden to them . 
For, indeed, they are most surely liars. 

Now, also, they who disbelieve say: 
There is nothing but our life in this world. 
And never shall we be raised from the dead . 
Yet if only you could now see 
when they shall be brought back to life 
and set before their Lord for Judgment . 
He shall say to them : 

Is this Resurrection to life not the very truth? 
They shall say: Oh yes, indeed! 
By our Lord it is ! 
He shall say: 

Then taste the everlasting torment 
in that before this Day you have disbelieved! 
6:3i Truly those in life 

who have belied resurrection 
and the destined Meeting of God 
for Judgment in the Hereafter 
shall lose all — 

until, suddenly, when the Hour of Doom 
shall have come to them, they shall say: 
Alas for us! 

for all that we have neglected 
regarding this Day ! 
And they shall carry their load of sin 
upon their backs. 

Most surely, evil is the load they bear. 
6:32 For the life of this world

is nothing but play and amusement. 
And, most surely, 

the abode of the Hereafter is far better 

for those who are God-fearing. 

Will you not, then, understand? 
6:33 Truly, We know that what they say 

in open defiance of your message 

grieves you, O Muhammad . 

But it is not really you 

whom they are belying. 

Rather, it is the revealed signs of God 

that the godless wrongdoers disavow. 
6:34 Yet very truly, messengers before you, 

O Muhammad, were belied. 

But they endured patiently 

against the denials and harm they suffered — 

until Our help came to them. 

For there is none who can replace 

the words of God, 

which have assured you of victory . 

And very truly, 

some account of what the messengers faced 
and their ultimate triumph 
has already come to you. 
6:35 Yet as to the disbelievers , if their turning away 
is too great a burden on you, O Prophet, 
then seek a tunnel into the heart of the Earth, 
if you are so able, or a stairway to Heaven, 
so as to bring to them a sign 
that will make them believe ! 
For had God so willed, 

He would most surely have gathered them all 

upon the path of guidance. 

So never become of the ignorant, 

frozen with anguish .

6:36 ^Indeed, only those who truly hear 
shall answer the call to faith . 
And as for the dead of heart, who disbelieve , 
God shall, indeed, resurrect them as well . 
Then to Him they shall all be returned. 

6:37 Moreover, in arrogance 

they have said of you, O Prophet : 
If only a miraculous sign from his Lord 
were sent down to him! 
Say to them : 
Indeed, God is well able 
to send down such a sign. 
Yet most of them do not know 
the wisdom of God . 

6:38 For there is not a single beast 
treading on the earth, 
nor a bird flying with its two wings, 
but that they are communities like you. 
We have not neglected anything 
in the Preserved Book of Heaven . 
Then they who ask for miracles 
shall be assembled in the Hereafter 
before their Lord with all people . 

6:39 And so it is 

that those who have denied Our signs 

are deaf and dumb to God's living miracles, 

cut off in veils of darkness. 

Whomever God so wills, He leaves astray. 

And whomever God so wills, 

He sets upon a straight way of salvation . 

6:40 Say to all those 

who take associate-gods with God : 

Have you considered if the punishment of God 

were to come to you, 





215 



SURAH 6 I AL-AN C AM - CATTLE

or if the Hour of Doom itself 

were to come to you? 

Would it be other than God 

whom you would call upon for help , 

if you are truthful with yourselves ? 
6:4i Rather, it is only Him you call upon! 

And He alone removes the affliction 

for which you call Him, if He so wills — 

for then you utterly forget 

all that you associate as gods with Him . 
6:42 And very truly, We have sent messengers 

to communities before you. 

But they denied Our message, 

so We seized them with affliction 

and harm in this world , 

so that they might humble themselves. 
6:43 Yet if only when Our affliction came to them, 

they had humbled themselves. 

But rather, their hearts hardened, 

and Satan made what they were doing 

fair-seeming to them. 
6:44 Then when they forgot that true faith 

of which they had been reminded, 

We opened for them 

the gates of everything they desired — 

until when they exulted 

in what they had been given, 

We seized them suddenly; 

and then they became utterly despondent. 
6:45 Thus all the people who did wrong — 

to the very last one of them — were cut off. 

For all praise is for God alone , 

Lord of Alf the Worlds. 
6:46 Say to them : 

Have you considered if God

were to take away your hearing 

and your sight and seal up your hearts? 

Who is that god, other than God Himself , 

that would give them back to you? 

Behold how We vary the clear signs. 

Yet still they turn away. 
6:47 Say to them : 

Have you considered if the torment of God 

were to come upon you suddenly, or overtly? 

Would anyone be destroyed 

but the wrongdoing people? 
6:48 Thus We do not send the messengers 

but as bearers of glad tidings to the believers 

of everlasting delight in Paradise , 

and as forewarners of God's nearing Judgment . 

So whoever believes and does righteousness — 

there shall be no fear upon them 

when they assemble for Judgment . 

Nor shall they ever grieve 
over the life of the world . 
6:49 But as to those who deny Our signs, 

the torment shall touch them 

for the deeds of ungodliness 

they have committed. 
6:50 Say to them, O Muhammad : 

I do not say to you 

that the treasures of God are with me, 

nor that I know the unseen. 

Nor do I say to you that I am an angel. 

I but follow what is revealed to me. 

Say to them : 

Are the blind and the seeing equal? 
Will you not, then, reflect on the signs of God ? 
6:5i Hence, forewarn with this Quran 
all those who fear being gathered

before their Lord 

that they have no patron apart from Him, 
nor any intercessor, 
so that they may become God-fearing. 
6:52 Nor shall you heed the arrogant 
and send away the humble 
who call upon their Lord with devotion 
in the morning and in the evening, 
desiring only His Face. 

Nothing of their reckoning bears upon you. 
And nothing of your reckoning 
bears upon them 
that you should send them away 
and thus become of the wrongdoers. 
6:53 For in this variance of wealth and poverty 
We but try some of them 
through the condition of the others — 
that they who are rich and powerful 
might be tempted to say: 
Is it these, the poor and the meek, 
upon whom God has conferred favor 
among all of us? 

Rather, is not God most knowing 

of those who are thankful? 
6:54 So when those who believe 

in Our revealed signs come to you, 

then say to them : Peace be upon you! 

Your Lord has prescribed 

for Himself mercy, 

so that whoever among you 

does a misdeed in ignorance, 

then repents after it, and sets things aright, 

then, indeed, He is all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 
6:55 And so it is that We make utterly distinct 

the revealed signs, so as to make manifest

the contrary way of the defiant unbelievers. 

Say to them, O Prophet : 

Indeed, I have been forbidden 

to worship all those whom you call upon 

apart from God. Then say: 

I shall not follow your whims. 

For then I would have certainly gone astray, 

and I would not be of the rightly guided. 

Say to them, as well : 

I am firmly established 

on a clear proof from my Lord. 

Yet you have belied it. 

It is not in my power 

to carry out the threat of divine judgment 
which you seek to hasten. 
Judgment belongs to none but God. 
He relates nothing but the truth 
in His forewarnings . 
And He is the very best of judges. 
Say to them : 
If what you seek to hasten 
of your punishment was with me, 
the matter would have been decided 
between me and you. 

But God knows best about the wrongdoers 
who are godless in heart . 

Moreover, with Him are the keys 
of the realms of the unseen. 
No one knows of them but Him. 
And He knows, as well, 
all that is in the land and the sea. 
Not even a leaf falls but He knows it. 
Nor is there a single grain 
hidden within the veils 
of the darkness of the earth — 




219 



SURAH 6 I AL-AN C AM - CATTLE

nor anything moist therein 

nor anything withered — 

but that it is recorded in a clear Book 

preserved in Heaven . 
6:60 Moreover, it is He who takes your souls 

by night as you sleep . 

And He knows what you earn by day. 

Then He restores your souls, 

awakening you therein 

for a stated term to be fulfilled. 

Then to Him is your return in the Afterlife . 

Then He shall tell you the due recompense 

of all that you have been doing in life . 
6:6i For He alone is all-dominating 

over all His servants. 

Thus He sends angels, as guardians over you, 
to record your every deed — 
until when death comes to any one of you, 
Our messenger-angels take his soul — 
and never do they neglect anything 
they are ordered to do . 
6:62 Then they who die are returned to God, 
their true Patron. 

Most surely, judgment belongs to Him alone — 

and He is the swiftest of reckoners. 
6:63 Say to them : 

Who is it that delivers you 

from the veils of darkness of land and sea? 

You call upon Him imploringly and inwardly: 

If He delivers us from this peril , 

we shall most surely 

be of those who are ever-thankful! 
6:64 Say to them : 

God delivers you from this 

and from every anguish!

or from beneath your feet; 

or to confound you into dissenting factions 

and cause some of you 

to taste the violent affliction of others. 

Behold how We vary the clear signs,

6:66 Yet your people have denied this Quran,

then turn away from them

And if Satan should ever cause you 

to forget this command , then do not continue 

to sit with the wrongdoing people 

after remembering this . 
6:69 And while those who are God-fearing 

bear nothing of the disbelievers' sin 

or their reckoning, 

nevertheless, they should give them a reminder,

and become God-fearing.

as play and amusement

so that no soul shall be wrecked

For each soul shall have neither patron 

nor intercessor 

apart from God on Judgment Day . 
And even if it seeks to ransom itself 
with every conceivable ransom, 
such shall not be accepted from it. 
These are the ones who shall be wrecked 
by what they have earned. 
For them, in the Hereafter,

6:77 So when he saw the moon rising, he said: 
This is my Lord! 

Then when it disappeared, he said: 
If my Lord does not guide me,

6:78 So when he saw the sun rising, he said:

6:80 And so his people argued with him 

about his faith . 

He said: Do you argue with me 
concerning the Oneness of God, 
while truly He Himself has guided me 
to the truth ? 

Thus I shall never fear your threats of wrath 

from all the gods 

that you associate with Him — 

except if my Lord were to will something; 

for my Lord has encompassed 

all things in knowledge. 

Will you not then be mindful that God is One ?

to associate in worship with God 

that for which He has not sent down to you 

any authority? 

Which of these two parties, then, 

is more worthy of feeling secure — 

if, indeed, you know the truth ? 
6:82 Those who believe in the One God — 

and who do not mingle their faith 

with wrongdoing — 

it is these who shall have security 

from God's Judgment . 

For they are, indeed, guided. 
6:83 Such, then, was Our clear argument. 

We gave it to Abraham against his people. 

We raise in rank whomever We so will. 

Indeed, your Lord is all- wise, all-knowing. 
6:84 And to him We granted Isaac 

and, from Isaac, Jacob. 

Each We guided. 

And Noah We had guided long before. 
And descending from Noah , of his seed, 
We guided David and Solomon, 
and Job and Joseph, and Moses and Aaron. 
And even so do We reward 
all those who excel in doing good. 

6:85 And also We guided 

Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias. 
All are of the righteous. 

6:86 And so too We guided 

Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot. 
And each of these messengers 
We preferred above all the people 
of their times . 

6:87 And thus have We guided

many of their forefathers, 
and their descendants, and their brethren. 
For We chose them and guided them 
to a straight way of salvation . 
6:88 Such is the guidance of God. 
He guides with it 

whomever He so wills of His servants. 
But had they associated others 
as gods with Him , 
all the good they had ever done 
would be rendered utterly futile for them 
with God . 
6:89 These are the ones 

to whom We gave the Scripture, 

and the knowledge of revealed wisdom, 

and the inspiration of prophethood. 

So if these unbelievers now disbelieve in it, 

then, assuredly, 

We have already entrusted it to a people 
who do not disbelieve in it. 
6:90 These prophets of old are the ones 
whom God has guided. 
So follow after their guidance, 

walking in their way. 
And say to those 
who disbelieve in this message : 
I do not ask of you any reward for it. 
Indeed, this Quran is but a revealed Reminder 

sent to all the people of the worlds. 
6:9i Thus they who disbelieve 

have not esteemed God with His rightful esteem 

when they have said: 

God has never sent down anything 

of His Heavenly revelation 
to a mere human being.

Who then sent down the Scripture

as a light and guidance for people? 
You, O People of the Scripture, 
make of it parchments, 

disclosing them in part and concealing much. 
And you who were unlettered in revelation 
have been taught from this Quran 
that which you did not know 
before its revelation — 
neither you nor your forefathers. 
Say to them all : God revealed it ! 
Then leave them

Bring forth your souls!

Moreover, you grew arrogant

Nor do We see with you your intercessors,

Thus all the false gods that you have alleged 
have gone far astray from you. 

6:95 ^Indeed, God alone is splitter of grain and pit.

of God's might and mercy 

for a people who believe. 
6:ioo Still, they who disbelieve 

have appointed for God 

associate-gods from among the jinn,

Moreover, they impute to Him sons

Rather, He created everything from nothing . 

For He is all-knowing of all things.

For He is the Subtle, the All- A ware.

from your Lord. 
Thus whoever sees them , 
then it is for the good of his own soul. 
But whoever blinds himself to them , 
then it is an offense against himself. 
So say to them, O Muhammad : 
I am not a keeper over you. 

6:105 And so it is that We vary the natural 

and the revealed signs; 

so that they who disbelieve may say: 

You have studied this from another ! 

And that We may bring forth the truth 

and make it clear to a people who know 
that it is revelation from God . 
6:106 Follow what has been revealed to you

He would not have given them 

wills to choose with, 

and they would not have associated gods

Therefore, We have not appointed you 
a keeper to avail them 
against divine punishment . 
Nor are you a guardian over them 
to compel them to believe .

which they call upon apart from God. 
For out of aggression they may revile God

Then He shall leli lliein the due recompense

6:109 Now, they who disbelieve have sworn by God 
with the utmost of their vows that most surely 
if a miraculous sign were to come to them, 
they would believe in it. 

Say to them : All such signs are only with God. 

Yet what will make you believers realize 

that even if these signs were to come to them , 

they still would not believe? 
6:iio Thus We turn away their hearts and their eyes 
from recognizing the varied signs , 

just as they denied the miracle of the Quran 

and did not believe in it 

from the very first moment — 

and thus shall We leave them 

in their transgression wandering blindly.

still, they would never believe —

Rather, most of them are ignorant.

that We have appointed for every prophet 
an inveterate enemy — satans, 
from among both people and jinn,

inspiring one another with florid words, 

causing mere delusion among themselves . 

Yet had your Lord so willed, 

they would not have done this. 

So leave them alone, 

along with all the lies that they forge. 
6:113 They but embellish words , 

so that the hearts of those who do not believe 

in the Hereafter may be swayed by them 

and be pleased with them 

and go on reaping the evil 

that they are diligently reaping. 
6:114 Ask them, O Muhammad: 

Shall I seek other than God as a judge 

between us , while it is He 

who has sent down to you the Quran 

as a Book detailing all distinctions? 

Yet those to whom 

We have previously given the Scripture 
well know that the Quran is sent down 

from your Lord with the truth. 

So do not ever be of those 

who doubt the revealed word of God . 
6:ii5 For the word of your Lord is ever fulfilled 

with profound truth and justice — 

and there is none who can replace His words! 

And He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. 
6:ii6 For were you to obey the dictates 

of most of those on earth, 

they would lead you astray 

from the way of God. 

For they do not follow anything 

but mere conjecture 

and do nothing but bring forth lies. 
6:ii7 Indeed, it is your Lord who knows best 



233

those who stray from His way. 
And He knows best those who are guided. 
6:ii8 So in the matter of food , 



i. : .1 



the name of God has been mentioned, 
if, indeed, you are believers 
in His revealed signs. 
6:ii9 And why should you not eat of that over which 
the name of God has been mentioned, 
while He has, indeed, made distinct for you 
all that He has forbidden to you— 
exempting that food 
to which you are compelled to eat of? 
For, indeed, many lead others astray 
by their whims, 

without any true source of knowledge. 

Indeed, your Lord knows best 

about the acts of the transgressors. 
6:120 Moreover, forsake all manifest sin, 

O humankind — 

and its hidden practice, as well . 

Indeed, those who earn sin shall be recompensed 

for all that they have been reaping. 
6:121 Thus you who believe 

shall not eat any flesh of that over which 

the name of God has not been mentioned 

in its slaughter . 

For it is, indeed, ungodly. 

And the satans do, indeed, inspire their patrons 
to dispute with you as to eating carrion . 
So if you obey them, 

then you, indeed, are most surely idolaters. 

6:122 So, is one who was dead 
whom We then gave life

and for whom We made light 

by which he might walk among the people 

like one who is as if shrouded 

in veils of darkness 

from which he cannot come out? 

So it is that whatever the disbelievers do 

has been made fair-seeming to them. 
6:123 And so it is, as well, 

that We have placed in every town 

its chief trespassers and defiant unbelievers, 

so that they may plot in it. 

Yet they plot against none but themselves, 

though of this they are unaware. 
6:124 Thus when a divine sign came 

to the people of Makkah , they said: 

We shall never believe until we ourselves 

are given the like of the revelations 

that the messengers of God have been given! 

Yet it is God who knows best 

where to place His message. 

Abasement decreed by God 

shall afflict those who defiantly disbelieve, 

and a severe torment shall befall them 

for what they used to plot against God . 
6:125 Thus whomever God desires to guide, 

He opens his heart to Islam, 

a willing submission to God alone . 

And whomever He desires to leave astray, 

He makes his breast 

narrow and constrained by it , 

as if he were mounting up to the heaven. 

Thus does God lay chastisement 

upon those who do not believe. 
6:126 For this religion is the way of your Lord: 

It is ever straight.

Thus they who denied the messengers 

shall bear witness against themselves

6:i3i That is so, for never has your Lord

Indeed, the godless wrongdoers 

shall not succeed. 

6:136 Now, the idolaters have appointed for God,

a portion of the tillage and cattle 

He Himself has created and multiplied. 

Then they have arbitrarily said: 

This portion is for the sake of God —

So whatever is apportioned

only depletes their own provision

And whatever is apportioned by them 
for the poor for the sake of God — 
rather they appropriate it

Thus it reaches the idol-altars 
of their associate-gods,

Yet had God so willed,

So leave them alone,

invoked thereby to other than God. 

But whoever is compelled 

by circumstance to eat any of this — 

without being rebellious

then, indeed, your Lord 

is all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 
6:146 And as to those of Jewry, 

We forbade every animal with undivided hoof.

Yet His severe chastisement 
shall not be turned back

And you shall not come near lewdness, 
what is manifest of it and what is hidden. 
And you shall not ever kill any human soul 
that God has prohibited, 
except by what is lawful and right. 

All this has He enjoined upon you, 
so that you may understand the 
commandments of God and observe them . 
6:152 And you shall not ever 

approach the wealth of the orphan 

in your care — except in the fairest manner, 
until he reaches full maturity 

and you return it to him . 
And in trade , fill the measure 
and weigh the balance with all justice; 
We do not task any soul beyond its capacity. 
And when you speak out, be fair, 
even if one party is a close relative. 
And fulfill the covenant of God. 

All this has He enjoined upon you, 
so that you may become mindful 

of the commandments of God . 
6:153 For, indeed, this is My way, a straight one. 
So follow it. 

Thus, you shall not follow other crooked ways, 
for they will separate you from His way. 
All this has He enjoined upon you, 
so that you may be God-fearing. 

6:154 Furthermore, 

it is We who gave Moses the Book 
of the Torah as a complete blessing 
upon one who does good, 
and as an explanation 
for everything fundamental to the Law ,

and as a guidance and a mercy, 

so that they who would have faith 

may believe in and work for 

the destined Meeting of their Lord. 
6:155 And this Quran is also a Heavenly Book 

We have sent down. 

It is blessed. So follow it. 

And be ever God-fearing, 

so that you may be shown mercy — 
6:i56 or else you would say in the Hereafter : 

Indeed, the Book was only sent down 

upon two groups of people long before us. 

And, assuredly, we were heedless 

of their scriptural study. 
6:157 Or you would say: 

If only the Book had been sent down to us, 

assuredly, we would have been 

more guided than them. 

So truly, there has now come to you 

a clear proof from your Lord, 

and guidance, and mercy. 

Who, then, does a greater wrong 

than one who denies God's signs 

and turns away from them? 

We shall recompense those 

who turn away from Our signs 

with the worst torment, 

for, indeed, they used to turn away unfailingly. 
6:i58 Then do those who disbelieve 

await anything other than for the angels 

to come to them with death ; 

or for your Lord Himself to come to them ; 

or for some of the great signs 

of your Lord, heralding the end of time, 

to come?

On a Day when some of the awesome signs 

of your Lord shall come at the end of time, 

sudden belief will not benefit a soul 

that has not believed before, 

nor a soul that has not earned any good 

from its belief. 

Say to them : Wait! 

Indeed, we too are waiting. 

6:159 As to those who divide up their religion 
and become factions, you, O Prophet, 
are not associated with them in anything. 
Indeed their affair is left only to God. 
Then He shall tell them the due recompense 
of all that they used to do in life . 

6:160 Whoever comes on Judgment Day 
with a good deed, 

then he shall have ten times the like of it 
in reward . 

And whoever comes with a misdeed, 
then he will not be recompensed 
but with the like of it — 

and never shall they be wronged in the least . 
6:i6i Say to them : 

As for me, my Lord has guided me 

to the straight way. 

It is the upright religion, 

the sacred way of Abraham, 

the purely upright in heart — 

and never was he of those 

who associated gods with God. 
6:162 Say to them : 

Indeed, my Prayer and my rites of worship 

and my life and my death 

are for God alone , 

Lord of All the Worlds.

And to this I have been commanded. 

Moreover, I am the foremost 

of those who are muslims, 

in willing submission to God alone . 
6:164 Say to them : 

Shall I seek a lord other than God, 

while He is the Lord of everything? 

Nor does a soul earn anything sinful , 

but that it is counted against itself. 

Moreover, no sin-laden soul 

shall carry the sinful load of another. 

Then to your Lord 

is your return on Judgment Day . 

He shall then tell you the truth 

about that which you have been disputing. 
6:165 For He alone is the One 

who has made you successors in the land, 

O humankind, 

and He has raised some of you above others 

by degrees, to test you 

in all that He has given you. 

Indeed, your Lord is swift in punishment. 

Yet, indeed, 

He is most surely forgiving, mercy-giving.

7.2 This is a Heavenly Book 

that God has sent down to you, 

O Muhammad . 

So let there be no cause 

for anguish in your breast from it. 

With it, you are to forewarn the disbelievers 

of divine judgment . 

Moreover, it is a revealed Reminder 

of God's commandments sent to the believers. 

7:3 O humankind! 

Follow what has been sent down to you 

from your Lord. 

And, apart from Him, 

you shall not follow any patrons. 
How very little you remember 
God's favor upon you ! 
7.4 Yet how many a sinful community 

have We devastated, 

such that Our deadly affliction 

came upon them by night,

SURAH y I AL-A'-rAf - THE HEIGHTS 



or while they were napping. 
7:5 Then their only plea, 

when Our deadly affliction came upon them, 
was but to cry out: 

Indeed, we have been godless wrongdoers! 
7:6 Thus, We shall certainly question 

on Judgment Day 
those communities to whom 

Our messages were sent. 

And We shall certainly question the messengers 

about what they conveyed to them . 
7:7 Then, most surely, 

We shall relate their every response to them 

with precise knowledge, 

for never were We absent — 
7:8 and the weighing of deeds on that Day 

will be true. 

Thus those whose balances 
are heavy with good works — 
then it is these who are the truly successful. 
7:9 But those whose balances are light — 

whose sins thus prevail — then it is these 
who shall have utterly lost their souls, 
for they were ever transgressing 
Our revealed signs. 

7:io For very truly, 

We have well-established you 
in the earth, O humanity . 
Moreover, it is We alone 
who have made for you therein 
prolific livelihood. 

How very little are the thanks that you give! 
7:ii And very truly, We created you. 
Then We fashioned you.

Then We said to the angels: 

Bow down before Adam. 

So they all bowed down, except Iblis. 

He was not among those who bowed down. 
7:12 God said to him : 

What has prevented you 

from bowing your face down to the ground 

when I commanded you? 

He said: I am better than him! 

You created me out of fire, 

and You created him out of mud. 
7:13 God said: Descend from this blessed place ! 

It is not for you to be arrogant herein. 

Be gone! 

You are assuredly of the eternally disgraced. 
7:14 Iblis said: 

Grant me respite,

7:15 God said: 

You are, indeed, of those granted respite.

7:17 Then I shall set upon them from before them

from their right and from their left. 

And You shall not find most of them thankful.

7:19 And God said : O Adam! 

Dwell, you and your wife, in the garden. 

Then eat, both of you, 

from wherever of it you so please. 

But neither one of you 

shall come near this single tree 
to eat of its fruit . 

For, then , you shall both 

be of the wrongdoers. 
7:20 Then Satan whispered to them both, 

to expose to them both 

what had been hidden from them both 

of their secret parts. 

Thus Satan said to them : 

Your Lord has forbidden you both from this tree 
only so that you would not become angels, 
or become of the immortal. 
And he swore to them: 
Indeed, I am truly of good counsel 
to both of you. 

Thus he caused them to fall into sin 
by way of delusion. 

So when they had both tasted of the tree, 
their secret parts became exposed to them. 
So, instantly, 

they both took to heaping together 
upon themselves leaves of the garden, 
whereupon their Lord called out to them both: 
Did I not forbid you both from this tree 
and say to you both that Satan is most surely 
a clear enemy to both of you? 
7:23 They both said: Our Lord! 
We have wronged ourselves! 
And if You do not forgive us

He said: Therein shall you live.

And therefrom you shall be brought forth

O Children of Adam! 
Let not Satan seduce you,

stripping them of their clothing,

Indeed, he sees you — he and his tribe —

on the Day of Resurrection. 
Thus do We make distinct the revealed signs

7:75 The elders among his people 

who had become arrogant said to those 

who were considered weak, 

to those of them who believed: 

Do you know with certainty that Salih 

is one truly sent from his Lord? 

They said: 

We are, indeed, believers 

in what he has been sent with. 
7:76 Those who became arrogant said: 

Indeed, we are disbelievers 

in what you believe in! 
7:77 So they hamstrung the she-camel. 

Thus they insolently defied 

the command of their Lord. 

Moreover, they said: O Salih! 

Bring us, then, whatever doom 

you have promised us, 

if, indeed, you are truly one of the messengers. 
7:78 Then the convulsion of the earth 

seized them, suddenly, 

and by morning they were dead, 

laying prostrate in their dwelling-place. 
7:79 So he turned away from them and said: 

O my people! 

Very truly, I conveyed to you 

the message of my Lord. 

And I gave to you good counsel. 

But you do not love the givers of good counsel. 

7:80 And mention Lot, as well , 
when he said to his people:

SURAH y I AL-A RAr - THE HEIGHTS 



Do the men among you 

openly commit such abominable lewdness 

with each other , 

with which no one has preceded you 
in all the worlds! 
7:8i You do, indeed, approach men in lust 
instead of women. 
No, but you are 

an exceedingly rebellious people! 
7:82 Yet the response of his people 

was only to say of Lot and his followers : 

Expel them from your town! 

For they are a people 

who seek to keep themselves pure 

from our ways . 
7:83 So We delivered him 

and his family from doom — 

except his faithless wife. 

She was of those who lingered behind. 
7:84 And We rained down upon them 

a devastating rain of marked stones ! 

So see how dreadful was the end 

of the defiant unbelievers. 

7:85 And to the people of Midian 

We sent their brother Shu c ayb as a messenger . 

He said: O my people! Worship God alone ! 

You do not have any God other than Him. 

Truly, clear proof upholding my message 

has come to you from your Lord. 

So equitably fill the measure 

and the balance in your trade . 

And you shall not defraud the people 

of their rightful things. 

Nor shall you spread corruption in the earth,

after it has been set aright by God . 
This is best for you, 
if, indeed, you are believers. 
7:86 Moreover, do not sit as highwaymen 
alongside every pathway, 
threatening people with robbery 
and barring 

those who believe in Him 

from the straight path of God, 

such that you seek to make it a crooked way. 

Rather, remember with gratitude 

when you were few, 

then He made you many. 

So see for yourselves 

how devastating was the end 

of the sowers of corruption! 
7:87 Moreover, if there is a group of you 

that believes in what I have been sent with 

and a group that does not believe, 

then be patient until God judges between us. 

For He is the very best of judges. 
7:88 Sir The elders of his people, 

who became arrogant, 

said: 

Most surely, 

We shall expel you from our town, 
O Shu c ayb, 

and those who believe along with you, 
unless you do, indeed, return to our ways! 
He said: 

Even if we are unwilling? 
7:89 Truly, we would forge a lie against God 
if we returned to your way of worship 
after God has delivered us from it. 
It is not for us to return to it,

unless God, our Lord, so wills. 
Our Lord encompasses all things in knowledge. 
On God alone do we rely. Our Lord! 
Judge between us and our people 
with the truth — 

for You are the best of those who judge. 
7:90 The elders of his people 

who disbelieved said to the people : 

Indeed, if you follow Shu c ayb, 

then assuredly you shall all be utter losers. 
7:9i Then the convulsion of the earth 

seized them, suddenly, 

and by morning they were dead, 

laying prostrate in their dwelling-place. 
7:92 Those who denied Shu c ayb — 

it was as if they had never dwelled 

in prosperity therein. 

Those who had denied Shu c ayb — 

it was they who were the utter losers. 
7:93 Then he turned away from them and said: 

O my people! 

Very truly, I conveyed to you 
all the messages of my Lord. 
And I gave to you good counsel. 
So how shall I grieve over a disbelieving people? 

7:94 Nor have We sent any prophet 
into a town that belied them , 
but that We seized its disbelieving people 
with severe affliction and harm, 
so that they might humble themselves 
before God . 

7:95 Then We replaced bad conditions with good, 
until they thrived and said: 
Truly, harm and joy 



or

have likewise touched our forefathers 

throughout time ! 

Then We seized them suddenly, 

while they were completely unaware. 
7:96 Yet if only the people 

of the faithless towns had believed 

and feared God, 

We most surely would have 

opened forth upon them blessings 

from the sky and the earth. 

But they denied faith . 

So We seized them, suddenly, 

for what they had duly earned. 
7:97 Do the people of the towns of the world 

then feel secure against Our deadly affliction 

that may come to them 

at night while they sleep? 
7:98 Or do the people of the towns of the world 

feel secure against Our deadly affliction 

that may come to them 

at mid-morning while they play? 
7:99 Do they, then, feel secure against God's design? 

For none feels secure against God's design, 

except a people who are losers 

of an everlasting Paradise . 
7:ioo Is it, then, not enough of a guiding sign 

for those who have inherited the land 

after it had been inhabited by others 

whom We destroyed for their sins — 

that had We so willed 

We could have stricken them too for their sins 
and set a seal upon their hearts, as well , 
so that they could not hear 
the admonitions of God ?

7:101 Such were the faithless towns. 

We relate to you of their tidings, O Prophet . 
For very truly, their messengers came to them 
with clear and miraculous proofs of God . 
But they were not such as to believe 
in what they had belied of old. 
And so it is that God 

sets a seal upon the hearts of the disbelievers. 
7:102 Nor did We find most of them willing 
to uphold any sacred covenant. 
Rather, We found most of them 
utterly ungodly. 

7:103 Then after them We sent forth Moses, 

with Our miraculous signs, 

to Pharaoh and his assembly of nobles. 

Yet they did wrong by denying them. 

So see how devastating 

was the end of the sowers of corruption! 
7:104 Thus Moses said: O Pharaoh! 

I am a messenger 

from the Lord of All the Worlds, 
7:105 obliged to say nothing about God but the truth. 

Indeed, I have come to you 

with clear and miraculous proof 

from your Lord. 

So set free and send forth with me 

the Children of Israel. 
7:106 Pharaoh said: 

If, indeed, you have come with a sign, 

then bring it forth, 

if you are one of the truthful 

messengers of God . 
7:107 So Moses threw his staff to the ground , 

and, behold, it was a manifest snake.

SURAH y I AL-A RAF - THE HEIGHTS

7:108 And he drew forth his hand 

from the bosom of his garment , 
and, behold, 

it was radiant white without blemish 

to all the onlookers. 
7:109 The assembly of nobles from Pharaoh's people 
conferred privately and said to Pharaoh : 

This is most surely a learned sorcerer! 
7:iio He desires only to oust all of you 

from your land. Pharaoh said: 

So what, O assembly of nobles, 

do you command concerning him ? 
7:in They said: O Pharaoh : 

Delay answering him and his brother, 

and send forth summoners into the cities. 
7:ii2 They shall come to you 

with every learned sorcerer 
to overcome Moses . 

7:ii3 So the sorcerers came to Pharaoh. 
They said: 

Shall there, indeed, be a reward for us, 

if it is we who are triumphant? 
7:ii4 He said: Yes! 

Moreover, you shall be of those brought near 
as an added honor . 
7:ii5 They said: O Moses! 

Either you throw your staff to the ground , 

or we shall be the ones 

to throw down our objects first . 
7:ii6 He said: You throw first . 

So when they threw down what they had , 

they bewitched the eyes of the people, 

and terrified them, 

and came forth with awesome sorcery.

7:117 ?|S-But We revealed to Moses: 

Throw your staff to the ground , 

and behold the power of God ! 

And at once it began swallowing 

all that they did falsify. 
7:ii8 Thus the truth befell them openly , 

and all that they had done was obliterated. 
7:ii9 For right then and there they were defeated, 

and they had become utterly disgraced. 
7:120 So the sorcerers fell to the ground, 

in astonishment , bowing their faces down 

in submission to God . 
7:i2i They said: 

We believe in the Lord of All the Worlds, 
7:122 the Lord of Moses and Aaron! 
7:123 Pharaoh said: 

Have you believed in him impetuously 

before I have permitted you to do so? 

Indeed, this is, most surely, a conspiracy, 

in which all of you 

have conspired beforehand in the city, 

so as to drive out its rightful people from it. 

Yet now you shall know 

how great is my chastisement ? 
7:124 I shall, most surely, cut off 

your hands and your feet on opposite sides! 

Then I shall, most surely, crucify you 

all together! 
7:125 They said: 

Indeed, to our Lord we are returning. 
7:126 Moreover, you are only taking revenge on us 

because we have believed 

in the sure signs of our Lord 

when they came to us. 

Thus they prayed: Our Lord!

Pour forth upon us patience, 
and take our souls as muslims, 
in willing submission to You alone . 
7:127 So the assembly of nobles 

from Pharaoh's people said to him : 
Will you leave Moses and his people 
to spread corruption in the land 
and to abandon you and your gods? 
He said: 

We shall forthwith slay their sons 

and keep their womenfolk alive for ourselves 

in bondage . 

Indeed, we are all-dominating over them. 
7:128 Moses said to his people: 

Seek help from God and be patient. 

Indeed, the earth belongs to God, 

and He bequeaths it to whomever He so wills 

from among His servants. 

Thus the ultimate outcome 

is success for the God-fearing. 
7:129 They said to Moses : 

We have been harmed 

with this very persecution 

before you came to us 

and after you have come to us. 

He said: It may well be 

that your Lord will destroy your enemy 

and make you successors to sovereignty 

in the land after them . 

Then He shall see how godly you shall act. 
7:130 And very truly, We seized the House of Pharaoh 

with severe drought and a dearth of fruits, 

so that they might become mindful 
of God's admonition . 
7:i3i Yet when the blessing of God 



^ n "t 




272

SURAH y I AL-A'rAf - THE HEIGHTS 



came to them, they said: 
This is due to us! 
But when any evil afflicted them 
for their obstinacy , 
they attributed ill-omen to Moses 
and those with him. 
Now, assuredly, 

their ill omen was decreed by God alone . 
Yet most of them did not know this . 

7:132 Moreover, they said: 

Whatever sign you bring to us 

with which to bewitch us — 

still, we shall never become believers in you! 
7:133 So We sent upon them the flood 

and locusts and grasshoppers and frogs 

and turned their waters into blood — 

utterly distinct signs 

that could only be from God . 

But they grew so very arrogant 

and were a people of defiant unbelief. 
7:134 Yet whenever Our chastisement 

fell upon them, they said: O Moses! 

Call upon your Lord for us, to relieve us 

by virtue of what He has covenanted with you. 

If you remove from us 

the plague of castigation, 

we will, most surely, believe in you 

and we will set free and send forth with you 

the Children of Israel. 
7:135 But whenever We removed 

the plague of castigation from them for a term, 

which they would then reach, 

at once they would breach their promise . 
7:136 So We took vengeance on them.

Thus We drowned them in the sea. 
For they persistently denied 
Our miraculous signs, 

and they were obstinately heedless of them. 
7:137 Thus We caused the people 
who had been oppressed 
to inherit the eastern and western parts 
of the land 

wherein We have bestowed blessings. 

Thus the good word of your Lord 

was fulfilled upon the Children of Israel, 

for they were patient. 

Moreover, We shattered to bits 

all that Pharaoh and his people wrought 

and all that they constructed. 

7:138 Now, We caused the Children of Israel 
to pass in safety through the divided sea. 
Then they came upon a people 
devoting themselves to idols 
they had fashioned . 
They said: O Moses! 
Make for us a god just as they have gods! 
He said: 

Indeed, you are a people 

who are steeped in ignorance! 
7:139 Indeed, all that these idol- worshippers 

are engaged in shall be ruined. 

And what they have been doing shall be in vain. 
7:140 He said: 

Shall I seek for you a god 

other than the One God, 

while He has shown you preference 

above the peoples of all the world?

7:141 And recall, O Children of Israel , 
how We delivered you 
from the House of Pharaoh. 
They were inflicting upon you 

a most evil torment, killing your sons 
and keeping your womenfolk alive 

for themselves in bondage . 
And in this, there was a great trial 
from your Lord. 

7:142 Thereafter, We promised to Moses 
thirty nights of retreat in Our presence 
at Mount Tur , 

and We completed them with ten more . 
Thus the appointed time of his Lord 
was completed in forty nights. 
So Moses said to his brother, Aaron: 
You shall succeed me among my people. 
And you shall do what is right. 
And you shall not follow the way 
of the sowers of corruption. 
7:143 So when Moses came at Our appointed time 
and his Lord spoke to him, he said: 
My Lord, show me Yourself, 
that I may look upon You. 
He said: 

You cannot withstand this, so as to see Me. 
But look upon the mountain. 
If it holds firm in its place, 
then shall you see Me. 
Yet when his Lord manifested Himself 
to the mountain, He caused it to crumble, 
and Moses fell down faint, utterly stunned. 
Then when he recovered his senses , he said: 
Highly exalted are You far above all !

I repent to You! 

And I am the foremost of the believers in You 

among my people! 
7 : i44 God said: O Moses! 

Indeed, I have chosen you over all people 

with the revelation of My messages 

to bear them to all those 

to whom I have sent you — 

and with the revelation of My words, 

which I speak directly to you . 

So take the commandments 

I have given you and hold to them . 

And be of those who are ever thankful. 
7:145 Thus We inscribed for him on the Tablets 

the fundamental Law 

of everything We had decreed in admonition— 
and given in explanation — 
regarding everything that We had enjoined 
upon the Children of Israel . 
So take hold of it 
with utmost power, O Moses ! 
And enjoin your people 
to take the very best of it and live by it. 
Otherwise, I shall show you, 
O Children of Israel, 
the dwelling-place in Hellfire 
of all those who are ungodly. 
7:146 I shall turn away from My signs 
those who have grown arrogant 
in the land, without any right. 
For even if they were to see 
every natural and revealed sign 
of Heavenly truth, 
still they would not believe in it. 
Moreover, if they see

SURAH y I AL-A'rAf - THE HEIGHTS 



the way of faith and right guidance, 
they do not take it as a way of life . 
Yet if they see the way of perversion, 
they take it as a way of life . 
That is because 

they have belied Our revealed signs 
and have been heedless of them. 
7:147 Yet all those who belie Our signs 
and the destined Meeting of God 
for Judgment in the Hereafter — 
their good works 

shall be rendered utterly futile with God . 
Shall they be recompensed 
with eternal Fire for other than 
all the evil that they have done? 

7:148 Still, the people of Moses, 

after his departure to Mount Tur , 

made from their ornaments 

a Golden Calf to worship — 

a mere spiritless body 

that with the blowing wind 

made the sound of a low. 

Did they not consider 

that it could not even speak to them, 

nor guide them in any way? 

They took it as a god , 

and thus they were wrongdoers, 

godless in heart . 
7:149 So when they fell 

to wringing their hands in regret , 

and they saw that they had strayed, they said: 

If our Lord 

does not have mercy upon us, and forgive us, 
we will, most surely, be among the losers 



277 



SURAH 7 I AL-A C RAF - THE HEIGHTS

of an everlasting Paradise ! 
7:150 Thus when Moses returned to his people, 
wrathful and sorrowful, he said: 
Woeful is that 

with which you have succeeded me 
after my departure ! 

Have you hastened your Lord's command 
of destruction ? 

And he threw the inscribed Tablets 
to the ground 

and seized his brother by the head, 
dragging him toward himself. 
Aaron said: Son of my mother! 
Indeed, the people oppressed me 
and were about to kill me! 
So do not make 

the enemies of faith gloat over me. 
And do not place me 
among the wrongdoing people. 
7:151 Moses said: My Lord! 

Forgive me and my brother! 
And admit us into Your mercy, 
for it is You alone 
who are the most merciful 
of all who are merciful. 

7.-152 As to those who took the Golden Calf 
as a god , 

indeed, great wrath from their Lord 
shall reach them, 

as well as humiliation in the life of this world. 
And thus do We recompense 
the forgers of idolatry . 
7:153 Yet those who did vile deeds, 

then repented thereafter and believed,

7:154 So when Moses' wrath abated, 

he retrieved the Tablets. 

For in their inscription was divine guidance 

and the way to God's mercy 

for those who had dread 
of the punishment of their Lord. 
7.155 Moreover, Moses chose from his people 

seventy elect men for Our appointed time 
to meet at Mount Tur, 

to offer their repentance . 

Then when they demanded to see God, 

and the convulsion of the earth 

overtook them, he said: My Lord! 

Had You so willed, You would have destroyed 

all of them before — and myself as well — 

for the Golden Calf. 

Will You destroy us 

for what the fools among us have done? 

It is only Your trial 

by which You leave to stray 

whomever You will 

and You guide whomever You will. 

You are our only Patron. 

So forgive us and have mercy upon us. 

For You are the best of those who forgive. 
7:156 iiS-Moreover, decree for us 

good in this world and in the Hereafter. 

Indeed, we have turned to You in repentance. 

God said: 

I afflict with My torment whomever I so will. 
Yet My mercy encompasses all things. 
Thus shall I decree it 
for those who are God-fearing

7:157 These are the ones 

who shall follow the last Messenger, 
the unlettered Prophet, Muhammad — 
he whom they find inscribed 
in the Torah that is with them 
and in the Evangel; 
he who enjoins them with what is right 
and forbids them from what is wrong, 
making lawful for them wholesome things, 
and prohibiting for them impure things; 
and relieving them 
from the burden of strict obligation 
and the yokes of oppression 
that were before laid upon them. 
So those who believe in him, 
and who ardently uphold him and support him, 
and who follow the guiding light 
that has been sent down with him — 
it is these who are the truly successful. 

7:158 O Muhammad, say: O humankind! 
Indeed, I am the Messenger of God 
to all of you. 

He is the One to whom the kingdom 
of the heavens and the earth belong. 
There is no God but Him. 

He alone gives life. And He alone gives death. 

So believe in God and His Messenger, 

the unlettered Prophet, 

who believes in God and His words. 

Moreover, follow him, 

so that you may be guided aright.

7:159 Now, among the people of Moses, 

there is a community 

that guides people by the revealed truth, 

and with it they do justice. 
7:160 For We divided them into twelve tribes, 

as communities. 

Thus We revealed to Moses, 

when his people 

sought drinking water from him in the desert , 
strike the stone with your staff. 
Then from it gushed twelve springs. 
Each group of people knew its watering place. 
Moreover, We shaded them 
with thin cloud cover. 
And We sent down upon them 
manna and quail for sustenance, saying : 
Eat of the wholesome foods 
which We have provided you. 
Yet they did not wrong Us 
with their defiant ingratitude . 
But, rather, it was their own souls 
they were all the while wronging. 
7:i6i For they rebelled when it was said to them: 
Dwell in this town. 

Moreover, eat from it wherever you will. 
Yet say to your Lord : 
Disburden us from our sins ! 
and enter the gate with bowed head. 
We shall forgive you of your sins; 
We shall increase abundantly in reward 
those who excel in doing good. 
7:162 But those of them 

who were accustomed to doing wrong 
substituted this invocation with a word 
unlike the Heavenly command 





281 



SURAH 7 I AL-A'RAr - THE HEIGHTS

that was said to them. 

So We sent upon them 

a plague of castigation from the sky 

for the wrong they were doing. 
7:163 Moreover, ask them about the town 

which was located by the sea, 

when they violated the Sabbath. 

Behold, again and again, 

their fish came toward them 

on their Sabbath day, shoreward, in plain view. 

Yet every day that they had no Sabbath, 

they did not come to them. 

Thus did We try them, 

for the deeds of ungodliness 

they had committed. 
7:164 And behold! 

A group in this community said 

to another who used to admonish 

the Sabbath-breakers : 

Why do you admonish a transgressing people 
whom God will destroy 
or whom He will torment 
with a severe torment in the Hereafter ? 
They said: We enjoin what is right 
to be blameless before your Lord, 
and that they may become God-fearing. 
7:165 So when the Sabbath-breakers 
abandoned belief 
in what they had been repeatedly 
reminded about by way of admonition , 
We delivered those 
who ever forbade wrongdoing. 
But, suddenly, We seized those 
who were ever doing wrong 
with a most woeful torment 



282 



part nine 



SURAH y I AL-A' rAf - THE HEIGHTS 



for the deeds of ungodliness 

they had committed. 
7-.166 Thus, when they had become insolently defiant 

concerning that from which 

they had been strictly forbidden, 

We said to them: 

Be you apes, most despicable! 
7:167 And behold! 

Your Lord has solemnly proclaimed 

that He will assuredly send forth 

against all the rebellious among them — 

until the Day of Resurrection — 

those who shall afflict them 

with the worst torment. 

Indeed, your Lord 

is assuredly swift in punishment. 

Yet, indeed, He is most forgiving 

and mercy-giving to the penitent . 
7:168 Thus We rent them apart 

into diverse communities and scattered them 

throughout the earth. 

Some of them were righteous, 

and some of them were otherwise. 

So We tried those of them who were sinful 

with both good things and adversities, 

that they might return to the way of God . 
7:169 Then succeeding after them 

came generations of impious descendants 

who — despite having inherited 

the covenant of the Scripture — 

chose rather to seize hold 

of the ungodly , fleeting things 

of this lesser world, 

while saying to one another : 

It shall be forgiven for us. 



283 



SURAH 7 I AL-A C RAF - THE HEIGHTS

And should more of the same fl eeting things 
again come their way, 

they will yet seize hold of them obsessively . 

Was not the covenant oi the Scripture 

taken by them, that they should say of God 

nothing but the truth? 

Moreover, they have studied 

what is in it, as well ! 

Yet the abode of the Hereafter 

is far better than all they have amassed , 

for those who are God-fearing. 

Will you not, then, understand this,

And He made them bear witness 
to their own souls — saying to them: 
Am I not your Lord? 
They said: Oh yes, indeed! 
We do so bear witness! 

This We did in the event that you should say 

on the Day of Resurrection: 

Indeed, we were heedless of this truth . 
7:173 Or that you should say: 

It was only that our forefathers 

associated gods with You from of old, 

and we were merely their posterity 

following after them. 

Will You, then, destroy us 

for what the real progenitors of falsehood did? 
7:174 And so it is that We make utterly distinct 

the revealed signs, 

so that they may return to the way of God . 

7:175 Recite to them, as well, 

the account of one to whom We gave 

Our illuminating signs, 

so that he might be upright and godly . 

But he stripped himself of them. 

So Satan followed after him. 

Thus did he become of the perverse. 
7-.176 And had We so willed, 

We would, most surely, have elevated him 

by these illuminating signs . 

But, rather, he clung to the earth 

and followed his whims. 

Thus his likeness is as the example of a dog. 

If you chase it, it pants. 

Or if you leave it, it pants.

7:177 Evil is the likeness of a people who have belied 

Our revealed and natural signs. 

Yet it is their own souls

in rejecting them . 
7:178 Whomever God guides, 

then he is truly guided. 

And whomever He leaves to stray, 

it is they who are the losers 

of an everlasting Paradise . 
7:179 For truly We created for Hell 

many of the jinn and humans. 

They have hearts 

with which they do not understand. 

And they have eyes with which they do not see. 

And they have ears 

with which they do not hear. 

Such as these are like cattle. 

Rather, they are more astray! 

It is these who are the heedless. 

7:i8o Yet to God belong the most excellent names. 

So call upon Him with them. 

And leave alone those who profane His names. 

They shall be duly recompensed 

for all that they have done in life .

there is a community 

that guides people by the revealed truth, 

and with it they do justice to others .

8:10 



The differing of the believers 

over the disbursement of the spoils 

is similar to the time when your Lord 

brought you out of your house 

with the truth, O Muhammad, 

with the command to fight the unbelievers 

at Badr , 

when a group of the believers abhorred it . 
They argued with you 
about the rightful judgment 

to engage in battle — 

even after it had become clear 

that it was inevitable — 

as though they were being driven into death 
while looking straight on at it . 
Yet, behold! 

God had promised you believers, then 
that one of the two hosts 

that you had come upon would fall to you. 
And you wished that the unarmed one, 

the trade caravan , would be yours. 
Yet God intended to establish 
the religion of truth in the land — 
in accordance with His words — 
and to cut off the very last remnant 
of the disbelievers, 

so as to establish, on the field of battle, 

the truth and nullify falsehood — 

even if the defiant unbelievers hate it ! 

Thus when all of you 

cried out to your Lord for victory , 

He, then, answered you: I will reinforce you 

with a thousand forces from the angels, 

following upon one another in ranks. 

Nor did God occasion this promise of help 



293 



SURAH &lt;

as other than a glad tiding for you — 

and for your hearts to be calmed by it. 

For victory comes only from God. 

Indeed, God is overpowering, all-wise. 
8-.li And behold! 

He caused slumber 

to overcome all of you believers 

before the battle , 

as a source of security from Him. 

Moreover, He sent down upon you, 

from the sky, water to purify you thereby; 

and to remove from you 

the defilement of the whispering of Satan; 

and to gird your hearts with strength ; 

and to set firm your feet thereby. 
8:12 And behold! 

Your Lord revealed to the angels: 

Indeed, I am with you. 

So confirm those who have believed. 

I shall cast terror into the hearts 

of those who disbelieve. 

So strike at the necks of the disbelievers , 

and strike from them every fingertip! 
8:13 That is because 

they willfully rebelled against God 

and His Messenger. 

Yet whoever rebels against God 

and His Messenger — 

then, indeed, God is severe in punishment. 
8:14 O disbelievers! 

That affliction is for you in this world ! 
So taste it! 

Yet, indeed, for the disbelievers, 
in the Hereafter, 

there is the torment of the Fire of Hell in wait

do not turn your backs to flee from them.

on such a day — 

unless one is maneuvering to fight,

great wrath from God. 

Thus his abode shall be Hell —

It was thus not you who killed them at Badr 

Rather, it is God who in fact killed them. 

Nor was it you, O Muhammad, 

who threw dust at them when you threw it 

symbolizing their fate .

in the disbelievers' hearts , 
He would have made them hear the truth . 
But even if He were now 
to make them hear it , 
they would still turn away, 
for they are evading the truth .

who has brought their hearts together. 

Had you spent all that is in the earth, 

you could not have brought 

their hearts together. 

Rather, God brought them together. 

Indeed, He alone is overpowering, all- wise. 

8:64 O Prophet! God alone is sufficient for you

8:65 O Prophet! Urge the believers on to the fight. 

If there are twenty of you who are patient, 

they shall strive to overcome 

two hundred foes . 

And if there are a hundred of you, 

they shall strive to overcome 

a thousand of those who disbelieve, 

for they are a people who do not understand 

for what cause they fight . 
8:66 God has now lightened the burden for you, 

for He knows that there is weakness in you. 

So if there are a hundred of you 

who are patient, 

they shall strive to overcome two hundred. 
And if there are a thousand of you, 
they shall strive to overcome two thousand — 
by God's permission. 
For God is with those who are patient. 
8:67 It is not for a prophet to take prisoners of war 
until he has thoroughly pacified the land. 
Most of you desire 
the fleeting things of this world, 
while God desires for you 
the everlasting life of the Hereafter. 
And God alone is overpowering, all- wise.

had formerly made a covenant: 
9:2 You may journey safely

God shall disgrace the disbelievers. 

9:3 Further, it is a proclamation 

from God and His Messenger to all people, 
on the day of the Greater Hajj -Pilgrimage, 
that God renounces the idolaters, 
as does His Messenger. 

So if you idolaters repent, that is best for you. 
But if you turn away — 
then know that you can never escape God. 
Thus give heavy tidings 
of a most painful torment 
to those who disbelieve!

So fulfill with them their covenants

Indeed, God loves the God-fearing. 
9:5 Then when the sacred months elapse, 

you may then slay the idolaters 

wherever you find them, 

or seize them, or besiege them, 

or lie in wait for them in every place of ambush. 

But if they repent and establish the Prayer

9:6 Now, if anyone of the idolaters

Then convey him to his place of security. 

That is because assuredly

Is it that you are so pleased

It is these whose good works 
are rendered utterly futile with God — 
in this world and in the Hereafter. 
Thus it is these who are the losers 
of an everlasting Paradise . 

9:70 Have the heavy tidings of those before them 
not come to them — 

the people of Noah, and the peoples of c Ad, 
and Thamud; 

and the people of Abraham, 
and the Dwellers of Midian, 
and the Overturned Towns 
of Sodom and Gomorrah ? 
Their messengers came to them 
with clear and miraculous proofs of God, 
and they belied them . 
For never would God wrong them 
by punishing them without cause . 
But, rather, it was their own souls 
they were all the while wronging 
with ungodliness . 

9:7i As for the believing men 

and the believing women — 

all of them are allies of one another. 

They enjoin what is right 

and forbid what is wrong. 

Moreover, they duly establish the Prayer, 

and give the Zakat- Charity, 

and they obey God and His Messenger. 

It is these upon whom God shall have mercy. 

Indeed, God is overpowering, all- wise. 
9:72 God has promised the believing men 

and the believing women

Gardens beneath which rivers flow, 

wherein they shall abide forever — 

and therein shall they have 

good and pleasant dwellings 

in a Garden everlasting. 

Yet the pleasure of God is greater still ! 

Assuredly, it is this 

that is the magnificent triumph! 

9:73 O Prophet! 

Strive against the disbelievers 

and the hypocrites, and be stern with them. 

For their final abode shall be Hell — 

and a most woeful destination it is! 
9:74 They swear by God 

that they have said nothing blasphemous . 

But most truly they have spoken 

the very word of unbelief. 

Indeed, they have disbelieved 

after professing their submission to God 

in Islam . 

Moreover, they have all along resolved 
themselves to do great evil against the Prophet 
to which they could not attain. 
Nor did they take umbrage against him 
for any prudent reason, 

except that God Himself and His Messenger 

had enriched them from His bounty! 

Thus, if they repent, 

it will be far better for them. 

Yet if they turn away, God will punish them 

with a most painful torment 

in this world and in the Hereafter. 

Nor do they have on earth 

any patron or supporter

to help them against God . 
9:75 ^For among them 

are those who made a covenant with God, 
swearing : 

If He gives us of His bounty, 

we shall, most surely, give charity , 

and we shall, most surely, 

become of the righteous! 
9:76 Yet when He gave them of His bounty, 

they became miserly with it. 

Then they turned away — 

and thus did they forsake their covenant . 
9:77 Thus in consequence, 

He has fixed hypocrisy in their hearts 

until the Day Hereafter 

when they shall meet Him, 

for they have failed before God 

in what they had promised Him 

and because they have been lying. 
9:78 Do they not know 

that, indeed, God knows their secrets 

and their concealed conversations 

and that God is all-knowing 

of everything unseen? 
9:79 Among the hypocrites 

are those who slander the believers 

as to the charitable offerings they volunteer. 

Indeed, they slander those 

who find no more to offer in charity 

than their personal efforts. 

Still, they scoff at them. 

Rather, God scoffs at 

the scoffers among them! 

And for them, 

there is a most painful torment awaiting

in the Hereafter. 

9:80 O Prophet! 

Seek forgiveness for them, 

or do not seek forgiveness for them! 

For even if you seek forgiveness for them 

seventy times, never will God forgive them. 

That is because they have disbelieved 

in God and His Messenger, 

and God does not guide the ungodly people. 

9:8i Those hypocrites who stayed back 
from this just fight at Tabuk 
rejoiced in their staying behind 
in utter defiance of the Messenger of God, 
for they abhorred striving with their wealth 
and their persons in the path of God. 
Thus they said to one another : 
Do not go forth in the heat! Say to them : 
The Fire of Hell is more intensely severe 
in scorching heat! 
If only they were to understand 
the consequence of their deed . 

9:82 So let them laugh a little now 

and weep much in the Hereafter — 
a recompense for all the evil 
that they have earned. 

9:83 So if ever God returns you, O Prophet, 
to any group of inveterate hypocrites 
among them, and they seek your permission 
to go forth with you on a campaign , 
then say to them : 

Never will you go forth with me, ever! 

And never will you fight with me any enemy! 

Indeed, you were well-pleased 

with sitting back the first time at Tabuk ,

so sit back with all those who stay back! 
9:84 Therefore, do not ever pray 

over any one of them who dies. 

Nor stand over the grave of such a one, 

for they have disbelieved in God 

and His Messenger 

and died while they were ungodly. 
9:85 And let not their wealth and their children 

stir your admiration. 

God only intends to punish them thereby 
in this world 

and intends that their souls may vanish 
while they are disbelievers. 
9:86 For whenever a surah 

like this one is sent down 
exhorting the faithful to believe in God 
and to strive in His path 
alongside His Messenger, 
the affluent among those of them 
who are hypocrites seek exemption 
through permission from you, O Prophet . 
Thus they say: 

Leave us to be with those who stay behind! 
9:87 They were well-pleased 

to be among those who remained behind. 

Thus a seal was set upon their hearts, 

so that they do not understand 

what is good and right . 
9:88 But the Messenger, 

and all those who believed with him, 

strove with their wealth and their persons. 

Thus it is these 

for whom all good things are assured . 
And it is these who are the truly successful.

9:9i There is no blame cast upon the weak

Say to them, O Prophet : Do not make excuses! 
For we will never believe you. 
God has already told us the news 
of your evildoing —

Then you shall be returned in the end

For God is all-hearing, all-knowing.

You do not know them. We know them.

Then they will be returned

9:102 Moreover, there are others

God may grant them repentance.

even if they are their close relatives —

9:ii4 Abraham's seeking of forgiveness for his father 
was only because of a promise 
Abraham had made to him. 
But when it became clear to him that his father 
was an inveterate enemy of God, 
he renounced him; 

for Abraham was, indeed, tenderhearted, 
most forbearing. 
9:ii5 Never would God leave any people to stray 
after He has guided them, 
until He has made clear to them 
the commandments they should fear violating . 
Indeed, God is all-knowing of all things. 

9:ii6 Indeed, to God alone 
belongs all dominion 
over the heavens and the earth. 
He gives life. And He gives death. 
And you do not have, apart from God, 
any patron or supporter to help you .

to the Prophet — 

as well as to the Emigres, and the Helpers, 

those who followed him 

in the hour of hardship, after the hearts 

of a party of the believers among them 

had nearly swerved 

from the path of the righteous. 

It was then He granted them repentance. 

Indeed, He was all-kind, 

mercy-giving toward them —

9:ii8 and so too upon the three believers 
who were left behind, 

who are herewith granted repentance . 
When, behold, the earth, for all its breadth, 

seemed to close in about them, 

and the very reaches of their souls 

closed in about them, as well, and they realized 

that there is no refuge from God 

except in Him — 

then He relented toward them, 

so that they may repent. 

Indeed, it is God 

who is the All-Relenting, the Mercy-Giving. 

9:ii9 O you who believe! Be ever God-fearing! 

And be with those who are ever truthful. 
9:120 Never should the people of Madinah 

and the Bedouins dwelling around them 

remain behind 

when the Messenger of God campaigns 
in the path of God . 

Nor should they prefer their souls over his soul. 
That is because 

never are they stricken with thirst, 
nor weariness, nor starvation 
in the path of God, nor do they tread a step 
that enrages the disbelievers therein , 
nor do they inflict any loss on an enemy — ■ 
but that it is written for them 
in the divine scroll of their works 
as a righteous act. 

Indeed, God never wastes the reward 
of those who excel in doing good.

neither small nor great, nor cut across any valley,

so that God may give them 
the very best recompense 
for what they were doing.

to fight all at once. 
Why should there not be — 
from every division of them 
that marches out to battle — 
a company that stays behind 
to become learned in religion, 
so that they may admonish their people 
about faith when they return to them, 
so that they may sustain their fear of God? 

9:123 O you who believe! 

Fight those in the region surrounding you 

who are disbelievers in God , 

and let them find in you sternness. 

And know that God is with the God-fearing. 
9:124 And, again, whenever a surah like this one 

is sent down exposing the hypocrites , 

then some of them say 

in denial and derision to the others : 

Which of you has this surah increased in faith? 

Yet as for those who believe, 

truly it has increased them in faith, 

and they rejoice. 
9:125 But as for those 

in whose doubting hearts there is a sickness, 

it merely adds defilement to their defilement. 

Thus they shall have died 

while they are disbelievers. 
9:126 Do they not see

that each year they are tried by God , 
once or twice? 
Yet still they do not repent. 
Nor do they even reflect. 
9:127 Yet, again , whenever a surah 

like this one is sent down exposing them , 
they look at each other utterly astonished 
and signal : 
Does anyone see you 

when you speak in secret ? 
Then stealthily they turn away 

from the Prophet . 

God has turned their hearts away 

because they are a people 

who do not have minds open to understanding. 
9:128 Truly, O believers , 

a Messenger has come to you 
from among yourselves — 
one upon whom it weighs heavily 
that you should suffer in this life 
or in the life to come , 

who is solicitous about you and your welfare, 
whose very nature toward the believers 
is sheer kindness and mercy. 
9:129 Yet if they who doubt or disbelieve 
turn away from you, O Prophet, 
then say to them : Sufficient for me is God. 
There is no God but Him. 
Upon Him alone I have relied. 
For He is the Lord of the Magnificent Throne.

as gods with Him . 
10:19 Rather, humanity was not at first 

other than one faith -community. 

Then they disputed and some disbelieved . 

And were it not for a preordained word 

that preceded from your Lord, O Prophet, 

to requite all people in the Hereafter, 

most surely, judgment between them 

would have been decided at once , 

concerning all that wherein they are in dispute 

and the disbelievers duly punished . 
10:20 Thus they who disbelieve say: 

If only a miraculous sign 

were to be sent down from his Lord 

to confirm him! 

Then say, O Prophet : 

Indeed, the unseen realm 

belongs to God alone .

So wait for the Judgment of God . 
Indeed, I too am waiting with you. 

10:21 Now, when We give such people 

a taste of mercy, after harm has touched them, 
at once they have a device of mockery 
to employ against Our revealed signs. 
Say to them : 

God is more swift in devising chastisement . 
Indeed, Our messenger-angels 
are writing down all that you devise. 
10:22 He is the One who empowers you to journey 
through the land and the sea — 
until, suddenly, 

when some of you are embarked on ships, 
and they are running with them 

upon the water with a good wind 

and they are exulting therein, 

there comes upon them a stormy wind; 

and the waves whelm them from every side; 

and they think that they shall, most surely, 

be engulfed by them. 

It is then that they call upon God 

for rescue with all sincerity, 

devoting their religion to Him alone, saying : 
Truly if You deliver us from this, 
we shall, most surely, be 
of those who are forever thankful! 
10:23 But when He delivers them, 

at once they commit and multiply 
offenses in the land without any right. 
O humankind! 
Indeed your offenses 

are but committed against your own souls, 
and are the mere enjoyment

of the life of this world. 
Then to Us is your final return. 
Then We shall tell you the due recompense 
of all that you have been doing in life . 
10:24 Indeed, the parable of the life of this world 
is like the water 

that We send down from the sky. 

Then the plants of the earth mingle with it, 

and from them people and cattle eat. 
Then when the earth assumes its floridness 
and becomes adorned, and its inhabitants think 
they have power over it, 
Our command of doom 
comes upon it, by night or by day, 
and so We turn it into stubble, 
as if it had never flourished just the day before. 
Thus do We make distinct the signs of God 
for a people who would reflect 

on the wonder of creation . 

10:25 Now, God calls all people 

to the Everlasting Abode of Peace in Paradise 

and guides whomever He so wills 

to a straight way of salvation . 
10:26 -sif For those who do good, 

there shall be great goodness 

and more in the Hereafter . 

Their faces shall not be overspread with grime, 

nor with humiliation. 

These are the Companions 

of the Everlasting Garden of Paradise . 

They shall abide therein forever. 
10:27 But for those who earn great sins 

and disbelieve , 

the recompense of an evil deed 



345 



SURAH 10 I YUNUS - THE PROPHET JONAH

shall be the like of it. 

Thus humiliation shall overtake them — 

for there is none to preserve them, 

apart from God — 

and it shall be as if their faces 

were enveiled by patches of deeply dark night. 

These are the Companions of the Fire of Hell . 

They shall abide therein forever. 
10:28 For on the Day of Judgment 

when We shall assemble them all together, 

We shall then say to those 

who associated gods with God: 

Stay in your place, you and your associate-gods! 

For We shall have set up a divide between them; 

thus their associate-gods shall say to them : 

It was not us you were worshipping! 
10:29 So sufficient is God 

as a witness between us and you. 

Indeed, 

we were utterly unaware of your worship. 
10:30 Then and there, 

each soul shall put to the test the true worth 
of all that it had formerly done in life — 
for they shall have been returned to God, 
their true Patron. 

Thus all the false gods that they used to forge 
shall have strayed from them. 

i0:3i Say to those who associate others with God : 
Who provides for you from heaven and earth? 
Or who holds power over hearing and sight? 
And who brings forth the living from the dead, 
and brings forth the dead from the living? 
And who conducts every affair 
of existence with perfection and wisdom ?

Will you not, then, be God-fearing? 
10:32 This, then, is God, your Lord, 
the Eternal Truth. 

S o after the truth, what is there but error? 
How, then, are you turned away from God ? 
10:33 And so it is that the word of your Lord 
will come to pass 

against those who commit ungodly deeds, 
for they do not believe. 
10:34 Say to them : 

Is there any among your associate-gods 

who originates creation 

then causes it to return to being 

after it passes away ? 

Say to them: 

It is God alone who originates creation 

then causes it to return to being . 

How, then, are you turned away 

from worshipping Him alone ? 
10:35 Say to them : 

Is there any among your associate-gods 

who guides to the truth? 

Say: It is God alone 

who guides to the truth. 

Then, is One who guides to the truth 

more worthy of being followed, 

or one who can find no guidance 

except if he himself is guided by another ? 

What has become of you? 

How do you make 

such an irrational judgment? 
10:36 For most of them do not follow anything 

but mere conjecture —

and conjecture avails nothing at all 
against the truth. 

Indeed, God is all-knowing of all that they do. 
10:37 Yet never could this Quran 

have been forged by anyone 

so as to have originated apart from God. 

Rather, it is a confirmation 

of all the Heavenly Scriptures that preceded it 

and a distinct detailing 

of God's decreed commandments. 

There is no doubt in it. 

It is from the Lord of All the Worlds. 
10:38 So is it that they say: 

This Quran is not from God. 

Rather, he who has claimed prophethood 

has forged it? 

Say to them, O Prophet : 

Bring forth, then, even a single surah like it! 

Moreover, call upon 

whomever you can for assistance , 

apart from God, if you are truthful. 
1039 Rather, more astonishing 

is that they have hastily belied a Book, 

the knowledge of which 

they did not even seek to comprehend — 

even before its unfolding signs and portents 

could come to light for them. 

So too did those before them 

belie their Heavenly messages . 

Then see how devastating 

was the end of the wrongdoers 

who are godless in heart ! 
10:40 Thus among them 

are those who insincerely profess 

to believe in this Quran .

And among them are those 

who openly do not believe in it. 

Yet your Lord knows best 

who are the sowers of corruption. 
i0:4i So if they belie you, O Prophet, 

then say to them : 

For me shall be the outcome 

of my work in life , 

and for you shall be the outcome 

of your work in life . 

You are innocent of all that I do. 

And I am innocent of all that you do. 
10:42 Moreover, among them 

are those who listen to you 

but do not give heed . 

Will you, then, make the deaf of heart hear, 
even though they do not understand? 
10:43 And among them are those who look at you 
but have no insight . 

Will you, then, guide the blind in heart , 
even though they do not see? 
10:44 Indeed, God does not wrong people 
in anything. 
But rather, 

it is people who wrong themselves. 
10:45 Yet on a Day Hereafter 

when He shall assemble them for Judgment , 
it shall be as if 

they did not remain in the world 

for more than an hour of a day. 

There, they shall recognize one another. 

Truly those in life 

who have belied resurrection 

and the destined Meeting of God 

for Judgment in the Hereafter shall lose all — 



349 



SURAH 1 0 I YUNUS - THE PROPHET JONAH

for they were not guided. 
10:46 But whether We show you in your lifetime 

the advent of some of the punishment 

which We have promised them, 

or We take your soul first , 

still to Us is their final return 

for recompense — and God is a witness 

over all that they do in life . 
10:47 Indeed, for every community, 

there is a messenger appointed 

to admonish them . 

Thus when their messenger has come to them 

and they resolutely belie him , 

it is then that God's judgment 

is irrevocably decided concerning all of them 

with perfect justice — 

and they are not wronged in the least . 
10:48 Yet they say in contempt : 

When will this promise 

of divine judgment be fulfilled , 

if you believers are, indeed, truthful? 
10:49 Say to them : 

I do not hold for myself any harm or benefit, 

except what God so wills. 

For every nation, 

there is an appointed term of existence. 
Then when their term comes due , 
they shall not tarry for even an hour; 
nor shall they go in advance of their time . 

10:50 Say to them : 

Have you considered if His punishment 

were to come upon you by night or by daylight? 

What form of its utter destruction 

would the defiant unbelievers seek to hasten!

while truly in insolence 

you were seeking to hasten it? 
10:52 Then it shall be said to those who did wrong: 

Taste the torment of eternity! 

Are you to be recompensed 

with other than all the evil 

that you consciously used to earn in life ? 
10:53 "5^- Still they inquire of you: Can all this be true? 

Say to them : Oh yes! 

By my Lord, it is, most surely, true — 

and never shall you be able to elude it ! 
10:54 Moreover, if each soul that had done wrong 

were to have all that is in the earth, 

it would, most surely, wish in vain 

to ransom itself in the Hereafter 

with every last bit of it. 

And oh how they will whisper regret 

when they see the torment 
of Hell that awaits them loom 

and the matter of their doom 

is irrevocably decided by God 

concerning all of them with perfect justice — 

and never shall they be wronged in the least . 
10:55 Most surely, to God alone belongs 

all that is in the heavens and the earth. 

Most surely, the promise of God is ever true, 

but most of them do not know this . 
10:56 He gives life. And He gives death. 

And to Him alone shall you all be returned.

an inspired admonition

of imminent Judgment from your Lord — 
and a healing for all that is in the human breast, 
as well as guidance for your salvation , 
and a mercy for the well-being of the believers. 
10:58 Say to all people : 

In the favor of God for this Heavenly guidance , 
and in His mercy — 
in this let them rejoice! 
It is far better than all that they amass 
of the fleeting world . 

1*59 Say to believers in false gods : 
Have you considered 
the way you place dietary restrictions 
on any of the wholesome provision 
that God has sent down to you, 
such that you have arbitrarily made 
some of it forbidden and some of it lawful? 
Say to them : 

Has God given you permission for this , 

or do you merely forge lies against God? 
10:60 Yet what do those who forge lies against God 

think He will do to them 

on the Day of Resurrection? 

Indeed, God is ever bountiful to all people. 

But most people do not give thanks 

for the plenty He gives them . 
i0:6i For you shall never be engaged 

in any affair, O Prophet, 

nor will you recite any verses concerning it 

from the Quran, 

nor shall you do any deed at all, O people , 

but that We shall be witness 

over each one of you 

when you are occupied therein. 

For there is not even an atom's weight

Nor is there anything smaller than that, 

nor larger, but that it is registered 

in a clear Heavenly Book. 
10:62 Most surely, the friends of God 

shall have no fear upon them 

when they Meet God for Judgment . 

Nor shall they ever grieve 
over the life of the world — 
10:63 those who believed and were ever God-fearing. 
10:64 For them, there are glad tidings 
of hope and consolation 

in the life of this world 

and the promise of Paradise in the Hereafter. 

Never can the decreed words 

of God's tidings be changed. 

This is, in truth, the magnificent triumph.

Indeed, invincibility is altogether with God. 

He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. 
10:66 Most surely, to God belongs 

all who are in the heavens 

and all who are in the earth. 

Thus those who call upon anything 

apart from God 

do not in reality follow associate-gods. 
Rather, they do not follow anything 
but conjecture 

and do nothing but bring forth lies. 
10:67 He is the One who has made the night 
for you to repose therein and the daylight 
by which to see. 

Indeed, in this there are sure signs 
for a people who would hear

So We delivered him and all those with him

Thus did We make them successors

For We drowned all those 

who belied Our self-evident signs. 

So see how devastating was the end

and He is powerful over all things. 
ii:5 Most surely, 

they enfold unbelief within their breast 

to hide it from Him. 

Yet, most surely, even when they seek 

to cover themselves with their garments, 

He knows well all that they conceal 

and all that they reveal. 

Indeed, He is all-knowing 

of all that is harbored 

within the breast of people . 
ii:6 SjS- Moreover, there is not a single beast 

treading on the earth but that its provision 

depends solely upon God. 

Thus He knows well 

its habitation upon the earth 

and its repository in the grave . 

All is decreed in a clear Book 

preserved in Heaven . 
ii:7 For He is the One 

who created the heavens and the Earth 

in a span of six Heavenly days — 

while before this 

His Throne was over the water — 

to test you and reveal 

which of you is best in deeds. 

Yet if ever, O Prophet, 

you say to the people : 

You shall, indeed, be raised up after death, 

those who disbelieve will, assuredly, say: 

This is nothing but manifest sorcery! 
ii:8 Moreover, if We defer the torment for them 

to a calculated period of time, 

they shall, assuredly, say: What keeps it back? 

Most surely, the day it comes to them,

it shall not be turned back from them, 

and that very punishment 

at which they used to mock 

shall have whelmed them from every side. 

ii:9 Now, if We give man a taste of mercy from Us, 

then We strip it from him, 

indeed, he is a most despairing, 
unbelieving ingrate. 
ii:io Yet if We give him a taste of blessing, 

after harm has touched him, 

he does, assuredly, say: 

The evils have gone from me. 

Indeed, he becomes exultant, boastful — 
ii:ii except for those who are patient 

and do righteous deeds. 

For such as these, there is forgiveness 

and a great reward. 
ii:i2 Then is it conceivable, O Muhammad, 

that you would leave 

some of what has been revealed to you — 

and that your breast become constrained by it — 

just because they say: 

If only a treasure trove were sent down to him 

instead of the Quran ; 

or if only an angel had come with him 

to confirm him ? 

Indeed, you are not but a forewarner 
sent to all people , 

and it is God who is guardian over all things. 
ii:i 3 So is it that they say: 

The Quran is not from God; 
rather , he has forged it? 
Say to them, O Prophet : 
Then bring forth ten forged surahs like it!

Moreover, call upon 

whomever you can for assistance , 

apart from God, if, indeed, you are truthful. 

ii:i4 Yet if they do not answer you, 
then know, indeed , 
that this Quran has been sent down 
with the knowledge of God alone 
and that there is no God but Him. 
So will you, O people, become muslims, 
in willing submission to God alone ? 

ii:i 5 Whoever desires the life of this world 
and its adornment, 
We shall render to them in full 
the outcome of their works in it, 
and therein they shall not be defrauded. 

ii:i 6 These are the ones 

for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter, 

except the Fire of Hell . 

And therein whatever they have wrought 

shall be rendered utterly futile, 

and all that they have been doing in life 

shall be nullified. 

ii:i7 What, then, of one whose faith 

is based on manifest proof from his Lord, 
who has — bearing witness to this — 
a revealed testament from God 
that has a precedent in the Book of Moses 
as a revealed exemplar and mercy? 
Such is the case of those 
who believe in this Quran . 
Yet whosoever disbelieves in it 
from the allies of unbelief , 
then the Fire of Hell 

shall be his promised place in the Hereafter . 
So never be in doubt about the Quran

and the commandments in it, O Prophet . 
Indeed, it is the very essence of all truth 
from your Lord. 

But most people do not believe in it . 
ii:i8 Yet who does a greater wrong 

than one who forges lies against God? 

They shall all be displayed 

before their Lord on Judgment Day , 

and the witnesses against them shall say: 

These are the ones who lied about their Lord! 

Most assuredly, the curse of God 

is on the godless wrongdoers — 
ii:i9 those who used to bar others 

from the straight path of God 

and who sought to have it appear crooked. 

They are the very people 

who regarding the Hereafter 

were inveterate disbelievers! 
11:20 The likes of these 

shall never elude God anywhere in the earth. 

For never did they really have 

any patron, apart from God. 

The torment for them in Hellfire 

shall be multiplied. 

Immersed in unbelief, 

never were they able to hear 

the word of God being recited to them . 

Nor did they see His guiding signs 

in the universe . 
ii:2i These are the ones 

who shall have utterly lost their souls 

in the Hereafter . 

For all the false gods that they used to forge 
shall have strayed from them. 
ii:22 There is no doubt at all that in the Hereafter

it is, most surely, they themselves who shall be 

the greatest losers of an everlasting Paradise . 
ii:23 As for those who truly believe 

and do righteous deeds — 

and who are humble to their Lord — 

these are the Companions 

of the everlasting Garden of Paradise . 

They shall abide therein forever. 
ii:24 ijS-The parable of these two groups is like this: 

There is one who is blind and deaf 

and one who is seeing and hearing. 

Are they of a comparable condition? 

Will you not, then, become mindful 

and take heed ? 

ii:25 For very truly, We sent Noah as a messenger 

to his people, saying : 

I am, indeed, a clear forewarner 
sent by God to you. 
ii:26 So worship none but God. 

Indeed, I fear for you the torment 

of a painful Day Hereafter . 
ii:27 But the defiant elders of his people, 

who disbelieved, said: 

We do not see you to be other 

than a human being like us. 

Nor do we see following you any but those 

who are the vilest among us — 

who did so in haste , moreover, 

without due reflection. 

Neither do we see that you believers 

have any excellence whatever over us. 

Rather, we think you are all liars. 
ii:28 He said: O my people! 

Have you considered your dreadful end ,

if, indeed , I stand upon 

clear proof from my Lord, 

inasmuch as He has given me revelation 

as a mercy from Himself — 

though this has been obscured from you? 

Shall we believers, then, compel you to it, 

though you are utterly abhorrent of it? 
ii:29 And, O my people! I am not asking of you 

any riches for this message of salvation . 

Indeed, my reward is only with God. 

Nor am I ever to drive away 

those who have believed, 

and who know they shall meet their Lord 

for Judgment in the Hereafter , 

whereas I see that you are a people 

who act in ignorance of this . 
ii:30 And, O my people! 

Who is it that will support me against God 

if I drive them away? 

Will you not, then, become mindful 

of the consequence of such an act ? 
ii:3i Nor do I say to you 

that with me are the treasures of God. 

Nor do I know the realm of the unseen. 

Nor do I say that I am an angel. 

Yet I shall never say to those your eyes despise 

that God will not bring them any good — 

while God knows best what is in their souls. 

For, indeed, then I would, most surely, 

be of the wrongdoers. 
ii:32 They said: O Noah! 

You have already argued about all this with us, 

and made much argument with us. 

Bring us, then, whatever doom 

you have promised us, if you are, indeed, 



368

SURAH 1 1 I HUD - THE PROPHET HUD 



one of the truthful forewarners sent from God 
ii:33 He said: Indeed, it is God alone 

who shall bring it to you, if He so wills. 

Moreover, never shall you be able to elude 

the judgment of the Almighty ! 
ii:34 Nor shall my good counsel 

benefit you in the least — 

even if I intend to go on counseling you — 

if it be that God intends 

to subvert you with ruin . He is your Lord. 

Thus to Him shall all of you 

be returned in the end . 

ii:35 So is it that they say: 

The Quran is not from God. 
Rather , he has forged it? 
Say to them, O Prophet : 
Even if I have forged it, then upon me alone 
is the consequence of my trespass. 
Yet I am innocent of the trespass you commit 

in alleging I have forged it . 

ii:36 So at last it was revealed to Noah: 

Indeed, no one shall believe from your people, 

other than those who have already believed. 

Therefore, be troubled no longer 

by whatever they have been doing against you . 
ii:37 Yet make the Ark 

under the care of Our watchful Eyes 

and according to Our revelation. 

But you shall not address Me 

regarding any reprieve for those 

who have done wrong. 

They are, indeed, doomed to be drowned. 
ii:38 So he began making the Ark.

And whenever any gathering 

from the defiant elders of his people 

passed by him, they scoffed at him. 

He said: If you scoff at us now , 

soon shall we scoff at you as you scoff at us. 
ii:39 For you shall, most surely, know 

to whom shall come a torment 

that will disgrace him in this life 

and whom an enduring torment 

shall befall in the Hereafter . 
ii:40 So it was — until when Our command of doom 

came to pass, 

and the very hearth itself erupted 
like a fount, as a sign and a portent — 
We said to Noah : 

Carry in the Ark mates of every living pair, 
and your family — 
except for those against whom 
the word of destruction has gone forth — 
and whoever has believed, carry also . 
Yet none had believed along with him, 
but a very few. 
ii:4i Noah said to them : 

Embark in it, in the name of God, 
wherein shall be its running and its arrival. 
Indeed, my Lord 

is most surely all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 
ii:42 Thus it ran with them on waves like mountains, 
and Noah called out to his son, 
who was in a place apart: O my dear son! 
Embark with us! 

And do not be with the disbelievers! 
ii.:43 He said: 

I shall take shelter in a mountain 
that will preserve me from the water!

Noah said: 

There is no preservation this Day 
from the fatal command of God, 
except on whom He shows mercy. 
And the waves came between them. 
And he was among those drowned. 
ii:44 And it was said: 

0 earth! Swallow your waters! 
And O heaven! Abate! 

So the waters receded. 

And the matter was concluded. 

And the Ark settled upon Mount Judi. 

And it was said: 

Away with the wrongdoing people! 
ii:45 Yet Noah called to his Lord, and said: 

My Lord! My son is of my family, 

and Your promise is the truth, 

and You are the most just of judges. 
ii:46 He said: O Noah! 

Indeed, he is not of your believing family. 

For, indeed, it is an unrighteous deed 

that he has done ! 

So do not ask Me 

of that whereof you have no knowledge. 

1 admonish you, 

so that you shall not become of the ignorant 

in what you ask of God . 
ii:47 He said: My Lord! 
I seek refuge in You 
from ever asking You of that 
whereof I have no knowledge. 
And if You do not forgive me 
and have mercy upon me, 
I shall be among the losers 

of an everlasting Paradise .

ii:48 It was said: O Noah! 

Disembark, with peace and security from Us, 
and with blessings upon you 
and upon the believing nations 

that shall descend 
from those who are with you. 
Yet there shall be other nations 
to whom We grant enjoyment in this life . 
Then there shall befall them 
a most painful torment from Us 

in the Hereafter . 

ii:49 That is of the tidings of the unseen past 
We reveal to you, O Prophet . 
You did not know of them before this, 
neither you nor your people. So be patient. 
For the ultimate outcome 
is success for the God-fearing. 

ii:50 And to the people of c Ad 

We sent their brother Hud as a messenger . 

He said: O my people! Worship God alone . 

You do not have any God other than Him. 

You are nothing but forgers of false gods . 
ii:5i O my people! 

I do not ask of you any reward for this message , 

Indeed, my reward is only with the One 

who originated me. 

Will you not, then, understand? 
ii:52 And O my people! 

Seek forgiveness from your Lord. 

Then repent to Him. 

He shall send down upon you 

rain from heaven in abundance. 

Moreover, He will greatly increase you

in power, adding to your power. 
So do not turn away as defiant unbelievers. 
ii:53 They said: O Hud! 

You have not come to us 
with a clear, miraculous proof 
that is convincing . 
And we shall not leave our gods 
on your mere word. 

Therefore, we shall never be believers in you. 
ii:54 We say only that some of our gods 

have struck you with something evil. 

He said: Indeed, I call God to bear witness — 

and bear you witness — 

that I am innocent of worshipping 

all that you associate as gods with God, 
ii:55 apart from Him. 

So plot against me, all of you together! 

Then do not grant me respite. 
ii:56 Indeed, I have relied upon God alone — 

my Lord and your Lord. 

There is not a single beast 

treading on the earth 

but that He is holding it by its forelock 

in complete subjugation . 

Indeed, every decree of my Lord 

is just and guides 

upon a straight way of salvation . 
ii:57 But if you turn away from faith , 

then truly I have conveyed to you 

that with which I have been sent to you 

by God . 

Thus my Lord shall cause other people 
to succeed you. 

Yet you shall not harm Him in anything at all. 
For , indeed, my Lord 



373 



SURAH 1 1 I HUD - THE PROPHET HUD

is vigilantly all-preserving over all things. 
ii:58 Thus when Our command of doom 

came to pass, 

We delivered Hud 

and all those who believed with him 

by a profound mercy from Us. 

And We delivered them, as well, 

from a stern torment in the Hereafter . 
ii:59 And that was the people of c Ad. 

They disavowed the clear signs 

and wonders of their Lord 

and disobeyed the divine mandate 

of His messengers 

while they followed the command 

of every obstinate, 

insolently tyrannical one among them . 
ii:60 Thus, at once they were pursued 
with a curse in this world — 
and it shall thrust them into Hellfire 
on the Day of Resurrection. 
Most assuredly, 

c Ad had disbelieved in their Lord. 
Most assuredly, away with c Ad, 
the people of Hud! 

ii:6i Sir Then to the people of Thamud 

God sent their brother Salih as a messenger . 

He said: O my people! Worship God alone . 

You do not have any God other than Him. 

He produced you from the earth 

and has settled you therein to cultivate it . 

So seek His forgiveness. Then repent to Him. 

Indeed, my Lord is near and answers prayers 
ii:62 They said: O Salih! 

High were the hopes

SURAH 1 1 I HUD - THE PROPHET HUD 



we had placed in you before this. 
Do you forbid us to worship 
what our forefathers worshipped! 
Indeed, we most certainly remain 
in much-perplexed doubt 
about what you call us to worship . 
ii:63 He said: O my people! 

Have you considered your dreadful end , 

if, indeed , I stand upon 

clear proof from my Lord, 

inasmuch as He has given me revelation 

as a mercy from Him? 

Who then will support me against God 

if I disobey Him? 

Thus never would you increase me 

in anything but utter loss if I followed you ! 
ii:64 And then he said : O my people! 

This is the miraculously created she-camel 

of God come as a sign for you. 

So leave her to eat in God's land, 

and do not touch her 

with any act of evil intent , 

or you will be seized, suddenly, 

by an imminent torment. 
ii:65 But they hamstrung her. 

So Salih said to them : 

Enjoy yourselves in your dwellings 

in the life of this world 

for only three more days. 

That is a promise of imminent chastisement, 

the truth of which shall not be belied. 
ii:66 So when Our command of doom came to pass, 

We delivered Salih 

and all those who believed with him 

by a profound mercy from Us

and saved them from the disgrace 
of that awesome day. 
Indeed, it is your Lord 

who is die AIl-Fowerful, the Overpowering. 
ii:67 For, suddenly, 

the deadly blast seized those who did wrong, 

and by morning they were dead, 

laying prostrate in their dwellings, 
ii:68 as if they had never dwelled 

in prosperity therein. 

Most assuredly, the people of Thamud 

disbelieved in their Lord. 

Most assuredly, away with Thamud! 

ii:69 And, very truly, 

Our messenger-angels came to Abraham 

in the form of men 

with the glad tiding of a son . 

They said: Peace to you! 

And to them he said: Peace! 

And he made no delay 

in bringing forth a roasted calf. 
ii:70 Yet when he saw that their hands 

did not reach for it to eat , he mistrusted them 

and conceived a fear of them. 

They said: Have no fear. 

We are angels sent to punish 

the people of Lot. 
ii:7i Thereafter, his wife, 

who had been standing aside, out of view, 

laughed, for We had given her glad tidings 

of conceiving Isaac in her old age , 

and descending from Isaac would be Jacob. 
ii:72 She said: Oh, woe is me! 

Will I give birth, though I am an old woman —

and this, my husband, is an aged man? 
Indeed, this is, most surely, an astounding thing! 
ii:73 They said: 

Do you wonder at the command of God? 
The mercy of God and His blessings 
are upon you, 

O People of the Household of Abraham . 

He, indeed, is all-praised, sublime. 
ii:74 So when the fright had gone from Abraham, 

and the glad tiding had come to him, 

he entreated Us regarding the punishment 

of the people of Lot. 
ii:75 Abraham was, indeed, most forbearing, 

tenderhearted, ever-penitent. 
ii:76 It was said: O Abraham! 

Turn aside from this, now . 

For truly, the command of your Lord 

has already come. 

And, most surely, a torment is coming to them 
that cannot be turned back. 

ii:77 So when Our messenger-angels came to Lot 

in the form of men , 

he was greatly troubled over them. 

Indeed, he grew helplessly distressed for them, 

fearing his people would molest them; 
and he said: 

This is an intensely unnerving day! 
ii:78 Then his people came rushing toward him 
to seize the strangers from his home — 
when just before 
they had been doing vile deeds. 
He said: O my people! 

Here, rather, are my daughters. Marry them. 
They are purer for you.

Most surely, you know very well 
that we do not have any true desire 
for your daughters. 

Rather, you know well what we desire. 
ii:8o He said: 

If only I had invincible power over you, 

or I could take recourse to a mighty defender! 
ii:8i Then and there, the guests said: O Lot! 

Indeed, we are your Lord's messenger-angels. 

Never shall they attain to you. 

So set out with your family 

in the latter part of the night — 

and let no one among you look back. 

But as to your wife, 

what befalls them shall befall her. 

Indeed, their appointed time of destruction 

is morning. 

Does not the morning draw near?

came to pass against Sodom , 

We made their land's uppermost its lowermost. 

Then We rained down upon it 

stones of hardened clay, clustered — 
ii:83 marked by your Lord! 

Nor is this ever far-off 

from the godless wrongdoers of the earth .

They do not worship

it was truly from God . 
Yet were it not for a preordained word

But, indeed, they remain 
in much-perplexed doubt about it.

you and all those 

who have repented with you. 

Nor shall you believers transgress. 

For as to all that you do, 

He is, indeed, all-seeing. 
ii:ii3 Nor shall you incline 

to those who do wrong, 

for then the Fire of Hell shall touch you. 

Moreover, you shall not have 

apart from God any patron, 

for then you will not be helped by God . 
ii:ii4 Thus duly establish the Prayer 

at both ends of the day, 

and at the near hours of the night. 

Indeed, good deeds remove misdeeds. 

This is a reminder 

for those who would be mindful 

and reflect on this admonition . 
ii:ii5 So be patient. 

For, indeed, God never wastes the reward 

of those who excel in doing good. 
ii:ii6 Yet if only there had been, 

among the generations before you, 

people of lasting virtue and righteous works — 

forbidding corruption in the earth — 

other than the few among them who did so,

And, indeed, before it was revealed ,

who were unaware of it . 

12:4 Behold! Joseph said to his father: 
My dear father! 

I saw in my dream eleven stars, 

and the sun and the moon — 

I saw them bowing down before me. 

12:5 He said: My dear son! 

Do not relate your vision to your brothers, 
for they will devise a plot against you. 
Indeed, Satan is a clear enemy to man. 

12:6 And thus shall your Lord choose you,

and teach you 

the interpretation of foreshadowed events, 

and thereby perfect 

His Heavenly blessing upon you, 

and upon the Family of Jacob, 

as He perfected it before upon your fathers, 

Abraham and Isaac. 

Indeed, your Lord is all-knowing, all- wise. 

12:7 Very truly in the narrative of Joseph 
and his brothers are signs 
for those who inquire after truth . 

12:8 Behold! The brothers of Joseph said: 
Most surely, Joseph and his full brother 
are more beloved by our father than we are, 
though we are a band of brothers . 
Indeed, our father has, most surely, fallen 
into clear misguidance in this . 

12.9 Kill Joseph 

or cast him away to some distant land, 
freeing your father's face and his affections 
for yourselves; and be you thereafter 
a most righteous people, once again . 

i2:io One of them said: Do not kill Joseph. 

Rather, cast him into the depths of a well 
where some caravan may pluck him out, 
if you must do something. 

i2.li They said: O our father! 

What has become of you 

that you do not trust us with Joseph, 

though truly we mean him well? 
i2 : i2 Send him with us tomorrow, to picnic and play; 

and, indeed, we shall certainly safeguard him. 
12:13 He said: Indeed, it truly grieves me

that you should go away with him. 

For I fear the wolf will eat him 

while you are heedless of him. 
12:14 They said: If the wolf should eat him 

while we are a band of brothers , 

then, indeed, we are, most surely, losers! 
12.15 So when they went away with him 

and resolved 

to put him into the depths of the well, 

We revealed to Joseph : 

You shall, most surely, tell them 

of this evil affair of theirs 

at a time when they are utterly unaware 

of who you are . 
12:16 So they came to their father in the evening, 

weeping. 
12.17 They said: O our father! 

Truly we went racing 

and left Joseph with our belongings, 

and the wolf ate him! 

But never will you believe us, 

even if we are truthful. 
12:18 And they brought forth his shirt 

with false blood on it. 

He said: No! 

But it is your own souls 

that have tempted you to something. 

Yet nothing is left to me but beautiful patience! 

And God alone is besought for help 

against all that you claim. 

12:19 Now, there came a caravan, 

and they sent forth their water-scout. 
So he let down his bucket into the well . 
He said: Oh, glad tidings! 
Here is a boy!

And they hid him as merchandise. 
Yet God was all-aware 
of all that they were doing. 
12:20 Thus they sold him for a paltry price, 
a number of coins; 

for they were disinclined toward him. 

12:21 The man from Egypt who bought him 
said to his wife: 

Tend graciously to his dwelling. 
He may benefit us, or we may take him as a son. 
And thus did We establish Joseph in the land, 
that We might teach him 
of the interpretation of events 
that dreams foretell . 
For God prevails in His affairs. 
But most people do not comprehend this . 
12:22 So when he had reached full maturity, 
We gave him prophetic wisdom 
and knowledge of God — 
and thus do We reward 
those who excel in doing good. 

12:23 Now, she in whose house he was serving 
solicited him, to have him. 
Thus she bolted the doors and said: 
Here I am, for you! 
He said: God is my refuge! 
I will not betray the High Minister . 
Indeed, he is my lord, 
who has made excellent my dwelling — 
and never 

shall the ungodly wrongdoers succeed. 
12:24 And very truly, 

she had firmly set her desire on him.

had he not seen a guiding proof 
from his Lord . 

In this way did We turn evil and lewdness 

away from him. 

Indeed, 

he was one of Our sincere, elect servants. 
12:25 So they both raced for the door, 

and she rent his shirt from behind. 

But they encountered her lord at the door. 

At once, she said to him : 

What shall be the recompense 

for one who desired evil with your wife, 

but that he be imprisoned 

or suffer a most painful torment? 
12:26 Joseph said: 

It was she who solicited me, to have me! 

Then a witness from her own family 

came forth and testified: 

If his shirt is rent from the front, 

then she has spoken the truth, 

and he is of the liars. 
12:27 But if his shirt is rent from behind, 

then she has lied, and he is of the truthful. 
12:28 Thus when the High Minister saw 

that his shirt was rent from behind, 

he said to her : 

This is, indeed, of your womanly cunning! 
Indeed, your cunning is great. 
12:29 Joseph, the High Minister said : 
Turn aside from this! 
And as for you, he said to his wife, 
ask forgiveness for your sin! 
Indeed, you have been 
one of the exceedingly sinful.

The wife of the High Minister 
solicits her servant to have him! 
Truly, he has pierced her heart with love. 
Indeed, we, most surely, see her falling 
into clear misguidance with this . 
12.31 So when she heard of their contriving gossip , 
she sent for them, 

having prepared for them reclining cushions. 

Then to each one of them she gave a knife 

for their repast . 

Then she said to Joseph, 

while they were cutting their delicacies : 

Go out to them! 

Then, when suddenly they saw him, 

they so thoroughly admired him 

that in heedlessness they cut their hands 

and said: God save us! 

This is no human! 

This is none other than a most gracious angel! 
12:32 She said: 

This, then, is he 

for whom you have blamed me. 
Indeed, I did solicit him, 
to have him for myself. 
But he resisted. 
Yet if he does not soon do 
all that I command him, 
he will, most surely, be imprisoned, 
and he will, most surely, 
be counted as one of the abased. 
12:33 He said: My Lord! 

Prison would be dearer to me 
than that to which they call me. 
For if You do not turn their cunning 
away from me, 

I might incline toward them and so become 



392

one of the wayward and ignorant. 
12:34 So his Lord answered him. 

Thus He turned their cunning away from him. 
Indeed, it is He 

who is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. 
12:35 Then it occurred 

to the prominent men among them — 
even after they had seen the clear signs 
of his innocence — 

that they should imprison him, for a time. 

12:36 Now, two young servants 
entered the prison with him. 
One of them said: 

I saw myself in a dream pressing wine. 
The other said: 

I saw myself carrying bread on my head, 

from which birds were eating. 

Tell us its interpretation. 

Indeed, we see that you are one of those 

who excel in doing good. 
12:37 He said: 

The food that, in time, 

you are to be provided 

shall not come to either of you, 

but that I shall prophesy to you 
about your dreams and their interpretation — 

before it comes to you. 

This is from what my Lord has taught me. 

Indeed, I have forsaken the ways of a people 

who do not believe in God. 

Moreover, with regard to the Hereafter, 

they are, indeed, disbelievers. 
12:38 Thus I have followed 

the sacred way of my fathers, 

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

It is not for us to associate anything 
as a god with God. 
This is of God's grace upon us, 
and upon all people. 

Yet most people do not give thanks to God 

with an undivided heart . 
12:39 O my prison-mates! 

Are various lords better, or God, the One, 

the All-Dominating? 
12-.40 All that you worship apart from Him 

are but mere names you have named — 

you and your forefathers. 

God has not sent down any authority for them 
in His revelations . 
Judgment belongs to none but God. 
He has commanded 

that you shall not worship other than Him. 
That is the upright way of religion. 
But most people do not comprehend this . 
i2:4i O my prison-mates! 

As for the first one of you, 

his dream means that 
he shall pour wine for his lord, 

the king of Egypt . 

And as for the other, he shall be crucified, 
and birds will eat from his head. 
The matter of which you inquire 
is now determined. 
12:42 Then he said to the one whom he knew 
would be delivered of the two: 
Mention me, before your lord, 
for I am innocent . 
But Satan caused him 
to forget mentioning Joseph to his lord. 
So he remained in prison for some years.

12:43 Now, one day the king said: 
I saw in a dream seven fat cows 
being eaten by seven lean ones; 
and seven green ears of corn 
and seven others withered. 

0 assembly of nobles! 
Explain to me my vision, 

if you are able to interpret such visions! 
12:44 They said: Just a muddle of dreams! 

Nor are we knowledgeable 

in the interpretation of dreams. 
12:45 Then the one who had been delivered 

from the two prison-mates — 

remembering, at long last — said: 

1 will tell you of its interpretation. 
So send me forth to the prison. 

12:46 He said: Joseph, 

O you who are truthful! 

Explain for us the king's dream 

regarding seven fat cows being eaten 

by seven lean ones, 

and seven green ears of corn 

and seven others withered, 

so that I may return to the people of the court , 

so that they may know its meaning . 
12:47 He said: 

You shall plant corn diligently for seven years. 

But what you have harvested leave in its ear, 

except a little, from which you shall eat. 
12:48 Then there shall come after this 

seven severe years of drought 

that will consume 

what you have reserved for them, except a little, 
of which you shall store for seed . 
12:49 Then there shall come after this

a year in which people are relieved by rain , 
and in which they shall rejoice 
and press grapes for wine . 

12:50 So the king said: Bring this interpreter to me. 
But when the messenger came to Joseph 
in prison, Joseph said: 

Return to your lord, and ask him about the case 

of the women who cut their hands. 

Indeed, my Lord 

is all-knowing of their cunning. 
i2:5i The king said, after summoning the women : 

What have you to say about your affair, 

when you solicited Joseph, to have him? 

They said: God save us! 

We know nothing evil of him. 

The wife of the High Minister said: 

Now the truth shall be settled. 

I solicited him, to have him! 

And, indeed, he is of the truthful. 
12:52 This is so he may know 

that I did not betray him in his absence. 

For, assuredly, God does not guide 

the cunning of the betrayers. 
12:53 ifcYet I do not absolve myself. 

Indeed, the self often bids to evil — 

except on whomever my Lord has mercy. 

Indeed, my Lord is all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 

12:54 So the king said: Bring Joseph to me. 

I shall choose him as an adviser for myself. 
So when the king spoke to him, he said: 
Indeed, from this day on, 

you are well established and well trusted with us. 
12:55 Joseph said: 

Appoint me High Minister

over the treasuries of the land. 

I am a good keeper and knowledgeable. 

12:56 And thus did We establish Joseph in the land, 
to settle in it wherever he so willed. 
We bestow Our mercy 
upon whomever We so will — 
and never do We waste the reward 
of those who excel in doing good. 

12:57 Yet, most surely, 

the reward of the Hereafter is far better 
for those who believe and are God-fearing. 

12:58 Thereafter, 

the brothers of Joseph came to Egypt , 

and they entered upon him 

at court, to request provision . 

He recognized them. 

But they were unknowing of him. 
12:59 When he had supplied them 

with their supplies, he said: 

Bring me that brother of yours 

from your father whom you spoke of, 

to receive his share . 

Do you not see that I have fully apportioned 

the measure of your provision , 

and that I have been the best of hosts? 
12:60 But if you do not bring him to me, 

there shall be no more measure 

allotted for you with me, 

and you will never come near me again . 
i2:6i They said: We shall solicit his father for him — 

and this request we will most surely act upon. 
12:62 He said to his servants: 

Place their own merchandise 

back in their packs,

so that they may recognize it 

when they go back to their families, 

so that they may return in hope of further aid . 

12:63 So when they returned to their father, 

they said: O our father! 

We have been prevented 

from any further allotment of provision 

if we fail the High Minister's request . 

So send with us our brother, 

so that we may have our measure, 

and, most surely, we shall safeguard him. 
12:64 He said: 

Am I to entrust you with him, 

as I entrusted you with his brother before? 

Yet it is God alone 

who is the best of guardians, 

and He is the most merciful of the merciful. 
12:65 But when they opened their belongings, 

they found their own merchandise 

returned to them. 

They said: O our father! 

What more evidence of good will do we seek? 
Here is our merchandise returned to us. 
We shall supply our families amply . 
And we shall safeguard our brother. 
Moreover, we shall gain an extra camel's load. 
That is an easy measure to obtain . 
12:66 He said: 

Never will I send him with you 

until you give me a solemn vow before God 

that you will, most surely, 

bring him back to me, 

unless you yourselves are entrapped. 

So when they gave him their solemn vow, 

he said in admonition :

SURAH 1 2 I YUSUF - THE PROPHET JOSEPH 



God is a guardian over what we say. 
12:67 Then he said: O my sons! 

Do not all enter the city through one gate; 

but enter through separate gates. 

Yet I cannot avail you 

against anything from God. 

Judgment belongs to none but God. 

On Him alone do I rely. 

And on Him alone , then, 

let the truly reliant believers rely. 

12:68 So when they entered the city from the points 
where their father had commanded them, 
it did not avail them against anything from God. 
It was but a need in Jacob's soul that he fulfilled. 
Yet, indeed, 

he was endowed with the revealed knowledge 
that We had taught him. 
But most people do not know 
the virtues of caution and faith . 

12:69 So when they entered upon Joseph at court , 
he took his full brother to himself. 
Privately, he said to him: 
I am, indeed, your very own brother. 
So be troubled no longer 
about what they have done to me . 

12:70 Then, when he supplied them 
with their supplies, 

he secretly put the royal drinking cup 
in his own brother's pack. 
Then a crier called out to them 
as they were departing : O you cameleers! 
Indeed, you are thieves! 
12:71 They said, as they turned toward them: 
What is it that you are missing? 




399 



SURAH 12- ! YUSUF - THE PROPHET JOSEPH

12:72 They said: We are missing the king's goblet. 

And for him who brings it forth, 

there is a camel's load of provision in reward — 

and that, the crier said, I guarantee. 
12:73 The brothers said: By God! 

Very truly, you know well 

that we did not come 

to spread corruption in the land, 

and that we are not thieves. 
12:74 They said: 

What then shall be the recompense 

for stealing it, if you are liars? 
12:75 The brothers said: 

The recompense for it shall be 

that the one in whose pack it is found — 

he himself shall be its recompense. 

Thus do we recompense the wrongdoers 

for stealing, in our religion . 
12:76 Then Joseph began the search with their bags 

before coming to his brother's bag. 

Then he pulled the goblet out 

from his brother's bag. 

Thus did We plan it for Joseph's sake. 

Never could he have taken his brother 

under the law of the king — 

except as God had willed. 

We raise in rank whomever We so will. 

And above every one who has knowledge 

is the One who is All-Knowing. 

12:77 The brothers said: 
If he now has stolen, 
then, truly, a full brother of his 
has stolen before! 

But Joseph suppressed his outrage at this 
within himself,

In his heart, he said: 

You are in the most evil position — 

and God Himself knows best 

about what you claim! 
12:78 They said: O High Minister! 

Truly, he has an aged father, 

well-advanced in years. 

So take one of us in his place. 

Indeed, we see that you are of those 

who excel in doing good. 
12:79 He said: God is my refuge! 

Were we to take anyone other than the one 

with whom we found our belongings, 

then, indeed, we would be wrongdoers. 

12:80 So when they despaired of him relenting, 

they withdrew, conferring privately. 

The eldest of them said: 

Do you not know 

that your father has taken from you 

a solemn vow before God, 

and that you have deserted Joseph before? 

Therefore, never will I leave this land, 

until my father permits me, 

or God so determines it for me — 

and He is the very best of judges. 
i2:8i Return to your father, and say to him : 

O our father! 

Your son has most surely stolen —

Nor could we safeguard him

he said: No! 
But your own souls 
have tempted you to something. 
Thus nothing is left to me 
but beautiful patience! 
May God bring each of them back to me, 
altogether! 

Indeed, He is the All-Knowing, the All- Wise. 
12:84 Then desolately he turned away from them 

and said: Ah! My sorrow for Joseph! 

And his eyes went white from grief, 

for long had he suppressed his anguish . 
12:85 They said to him : By God! 

You will continue mentioning Joseph 

until you are thoroughly drained, 

or you become one of those 

who have perished out of grief ! 
12:86 He said: 

I complain of my anguish 

and my grief only to God. 

For I know from God what you do not know. 
12:87 Now, my sons! 

Go to Egypt 

and inquire of Joseph and his brother. 

And do not despair of God's mercy. 

For, most surely, none despairs of God's mercy 

except the disbelieving people. 

12:88 So when they returned 

and entered upon the court of Joseph, 
they said to him : O High Minister! 
Famine has stricken us and our families.

Thus have we come 

with merchandise of little worth. 

Yet fill for us 

the full measure of our provision ; 

and be charitable to us. 

Indeed, God rewards the charitable. 
12:89 He said: 

Do you know what terrible harm 

you have done to Joseph, and to his brother, 

when you were ignorant 

of the grave consequences of your actions ? 
12:90 They said: 

Can it truly be that you, 

you are, indeed, Joseph? 

He said: I am Joseph. 

And this is my full brother. 

Truly, God has conferred divine favor upon us. 

For whoever fears God — and keeps patient — 

then, indeed, never shall God waste the reward 

of those who excel in doing good. 
i2:9i They said: By God! 

Very truly God has preferred you over us, 

and we have, indeed, been sinful. 
12:92 He said: There is no blame on you this day. 

May God forgive you. 

For He is the most merciful of the merciful. 
12:93 Go with this shirt of mine, 

and lay it upon my father's face. 

He shall come to me with his sight restored . 

And bring me your families, as well, 

all of them together. 

12:94 Now, when the cameleers had departed Egypt , 
their father said to those near him : 
Indeed, I sense the fragrance of Joseph, 
though you may deem me senile.

12:95 They said: By God! 

Indeed, you remain in the grip 

of your old delusion of seeing him again . 
12:96 So when the bearer of glad tidings 

came to Jacob . he laid the shirt upon his face. 

Thereupon, he regained his sight 

and said to his children : 

Did I not tell you 

that I, indeed, know from God 

what you do not know? 
12:97 They said: O our father! 

Ask God for the forgiveness of our sins! 

Indeed, we have been sinful. 
12:98 He said: 

I will ask forgiveness from my Lord for you. 

He is the All-Forgiving, the Mercy-Giving. 

12:99 So when finally they had all reached Egypt 
and entered upon the court of Joseph, 
he took his parents in his embrace to himself 
and said: 

Enter Egypt, by the will of God, 
in full security. 
12:100 Then he raised his parents 
onto the throne, 
and they all fell to the ground, 
bowing down before him in respect . 
He said: My dear father! 

This is the interpretation of my vision of before 
when I was young . 

Indeed, my Lord has made it come true. 
He was good to me 

when He brought me out of the prison. 
And now He has brought you here

Indeed, it is He, He alone who is

Truly, You have given me

O Sole Originator of the heavens and the earth!

without regard or contemplation ? 

12:106 Rather, most of them 
do not believe in God, 
except while associating 
others in His divinity with Him . 

12:107 Do they, then, feel secure 

against an overspreading torment 
that may come to them from God, 
or against the Hour of Doom itself 
that may come upon them suddenly 
while they are not at all aware? 

12:108 Say to them, O Prophet : 
This is my way. 

I call to God based on clear revealed proof- 
I and whoever follows me. 
S o most highly exalted he God. 



for I am not of those who 
associate gods with God! 
12:109 Nor have We sent any messengers 

to the generations before you, O Prophet, 
but mere mortal men, 
to whom We gave revelation, 
chosen from among the people 
of the established towns. 
Have they not, then, 
j ourneyed through the earth 
to see how devastating was the end 
of those who belied God's messages 
before them? 

Yet, most surely, the abode of the Hereafter

These are the revealed verses

Thus what has been sent down to you, 
O Prophet, from your Lord 

is the very essence of all truth, 

though most of the people do not believe it . 
13:2 God is the One

Then He settled Himself 

over the Throne befittingly . 

Moreover, He subjugated 

the sun and the moon to a fixed order , 

each one running its course for a stated term. 

He conducts every affair of existence 

with wisdom and perfection — 

even as He makes distinct 

all the signs of His truth —

He made all being therein as mates, in pairs.

Indeed, in all of this there are sure signs

13:4 Moreover, in the earth, 

there are neighboring tracts of varied lands ,

and date palms — 

some branching from the same root 
and some from different roots — 
watered by the same water in the same soil . 
Yet We make some of these plants 
superior to others 
in the quality of their produce. 
Indeed, in all of this 
there are sure signs of One Creator 
for a people who would use their reason

When we die and have become dust, 
can it be that we will be brought forth again

Indeed, God does not change

And should God so intend

then there is no repelling it. 

For, apart from Him, they have no other patron.

But all those whom they call upon 

apart from Him can give them no answer at all. 

It is just like one who stretches out his palms

Say, O Prophet : Name these alleged gods ! 
Are the likes of you to inform Him 
as to what He knows not in the earth? 
Or is it just a mere display of words? 
Yes, indeed! 

It is their very own contriving 
that has been made fair-seeming 
to those who have disbelieved. 
Thus have they been barred 
from the straight way. 
And whomever God leaves to stray, 
no guide shall there ever be for him! 
13:34 Rather, for them there shall be a punishment 
in the life of this world — 
and, most surely, 
the punishment of the Hereafter 
is far more onerous! 

Nor have they anyone to shield them from God. 
13:35 •&gt;!«• Contrast this with the wondrous state 

of the Garden of Paradise , 

which is promised to the God-fearing: 

It is such that rivers flow beneath it. 

Its produce is perpetual, as is its shade. 

This is the ultimate abode 

of those who fear God. 

But the ultimate abode of the disbelievers 

is the Fire of Hell . 
13:36 Now, as to those of good faith 

to whom We have previously 

given the Scripture — 

they rejoice 

in all that has been sent down to you 
from God, O Prophet . 
But among the allies of the disbelievers 
are those People of the Scripture

Indeed, I have been commanded 
to worship none but God alone , 
and never to associate 
anything as a god with Him. 
To Him alone do I call humanity . 
For to Him alone 
is my final return after death . 

13.-37 And so it is that We have sent this Quran down 
as a decisive judgment revealed in Arabic. 
Thus if ever you 

were to follow their whims, O Prophet — 

after the sure knowledge of the Quran 

has come to you from your Lord — 

then you would have neither patron 

nor shield to protect you against God. 
13:38 For very truly, We have sent mortal messengers 
to their own people before you. 

Moreover, We have given to them 

wives and children as you have been given . 

Yet never was it in the power of any messenger 

to bring forth a miraculous sign, 

except with the permission of God. 

But for everything that God decrees , 

there is a preordained term 

inscribed in a Book with Him . 
13:39 God obliterates what He so wills. 

And He establishes what He so wills . 

For with Him alone 

is the Preserved Tablet of Heaven, 

the mother of the Book. 
13:40 But whether We show you in your lifetime 

the advent of some of the punishment

For the reckoning rests solely with Us. 
i3:4i Yet do they not see 

that We come with the spirit of living faith 

to the land of the ungodly, 

and diminish unbelief in it from its outskirts? 

For when God decrees any matter , 

none can repeal His decree — 

and duly swift is He in reckoning. 
13:42 Thus, truly those who disbelieved before them 

also schemed against their messengers . 

But God alone has mastery over all schemes. 

For He knows what each soul earns — 

and soon, as well, shall the disbelievers know 

to whom belongs the ultimate abode of bliss . 
13:43 Still, those who disbelieve say: 

You are no messenger of God . 

Say to them : 

Sufficient is God as a witness 
between me and you — 
as are all those 

with sure knowledge of the Scripture 
bearing witness to this message .

If you give thanks for My blessings , 

I shall, most surely, increase them for you. 

But if you become ungrateful,

never shall you harm God. 

For God is, indeed, self-sufficient, all-praised. 

' r~\ i _ r 

wy w pcupic: 

Have not the tidings of those before you 
come to you — 

the people of Noah, and the tribes of c Ad, 

and Thamud, and those that came after them? 

No one knows them except God. 

Their messengers came to them 

with clear and miraculous proofs from God . 

But they turned their hands to their mouths 

in a gesture of mockery , and they said: 
Indeed, We disbelieve 
in all that you have been sent with. 
Indeed, we do remain 
in much-perplexed doubt 
about what you call us to worship . 
i4:io Their messengers said to them : 
Is there any doubt about God, 
the Sole Originator 
of the heavens and the earth 

with no precedent ? 

He calls you to believe in Him 

and to worship Him alone 

so as to forgive you of your sins, 

and to defer Judgment upon you 

until you fulfill a stated term of life . 

They said to their messengers : 

You are only mortal men like us! 

You merely wish to turn us away 

from what our forefathers have worshipped. 

So bring us miracles 

as manifest authority of your truthfulness .

IBRAHIM - THE PROPHET ABRAHAM 



It is true 

that we are only human beings like you. 
But God confers favor 

upon whomever He so wills from His servants. 
Nor is it in our power 
to bring you miraculous authority, 
except by God's permission. 
So upon God alone let the believers rely. 
H:i2 For why should we not rely upon God, 
while truly He has guided us 
upon our paths of faith and salvation . 
Thus, by God , 

we shall, most surely, endure patiently 
all the hurt you inflict upon us. 
And on God alone , then, 
let the truly reliant believers rely. 
14:13 Yet those who disbelieved 
said to their messengers: 

We shall, most surely, expel you from our land 

unless you return, indeed, to our ways of life ! 

Then their Lord revealed to them: 

We shall, most surely, destroy the wrongdoers 

who are godless in heart ! 
14:14 Moreover, We shall cause you 

to dwell throughout the land after them. 

This promise is for whoever fears 

standing for Judgment in My presence, 

and whoever fears My threat 

to punish the disbelievers . 
14:15 So they sought God's victory, 

and He supported them . 

Thus every obstinate, 

insolently tyrannical one was foiled! 
14:16 Moreover, beyond this life , 

Hellhre awaits such a one, 




423

where he will be given drink 

from a purulent fluid, 
14:17 which he sips, out of dire need, 

though he can barely swallow it . 

And though death will whelm him 

from every side, yet he will not die. 

Moreover, beyond this, still, 

lies even more stern torment for him. 
14:18 The parable of those 

who disbelieve in their Lord is this : 

All their works are like ashes, 

upon which blows a severe wind 

on a stormy day. 

They hold no power 

over anything they have earned. 

That is the uttermost point of misguidance. 

14:19 Do you not see, O humanity, 

that God has created the heavens and the earth 

with the very essence of all truth? 

If ever He so wills, 

He shall do away with all of you 

and bring about a new creation. 
14:20 Nor is that too mighty for God! 
i4:2i Even still, they shall come forth 

before God, all together, 

on the Day of Resurrection . 

The weak shall say to those who grew arrogant: 

Indeed, we were devoted followers of yours. 

So can you avail us in any way 

against the torment of God? 

They shall say to them : 

Had God guided us, 

we, most surely, would have guided you. 
It is the same for all of us now ,

SURAH 14 I IBRAHIM - THE PROPHET ABRAHAM 



whether we are frantic 
or we bear our torment patiently. 
No asylum is there for any of us. 
14:22 Thus Satan will say to the disbelievers 
when the matter of God's Judgment 
has been decreed: 

Indeed, God promised you the promise of truth. 

And I promised you, then I failed you. 

Yet never did I have any authority over you, 

except that I called to you, 

and you responded to me. 

So do not blame me. Rather, blame yourselves. 

I cannot heed your cry. 

And you cannot heed my cry. 

Indeed, I have disbelieved 

in your association of me with God 

from of old in the life of the world . 

As for the wrongdoers who are godless in heart , 

painful torment for them 

is now all there shall ever be . 

14:23 But those who believe and do righteous deeds 
shall be admitted 

into Gardens beneath which rivers flow — 
wherein they shall abide forever, 
by the permission of their Lord. 
Their salutation therein shall forever be: Peace! 
14:24 Do you not see how God 
has set forth this parable? 
A good word of faith, 

in witness of One God, is like a good tree: 
Its root is set firm. 
And its branches are in heaven. 
14:25 It brings forth its produce 
at every season, on time, 



•"-(*?

by permission of its Lord. 

And God sets forth parables for all people, 

so that they may become mindful 

of His commandments . 
14:26 Thus the parable of a corrupt word of unbelief 

is this : It is like a corrupt tree. 

Uprooted from the surface of the earth, 

it has no stability. 

14:27 God alone sets firm those who believe 

with the firm word of faith, 

in both the life of this world 

and in the Hereafter. 

Yet God leads the wrongdoers astray, 

for they are godless in heart . 

And God does whatever He so wills. 

14:28 -5;£Have you not seen, O humanity, 

those who substitute the blessings of God 
with unbelief, 

and who thereby lead their people 

into the abode of ruin? 
14:29 It is Hell, in which they shall roast — 

and a most woeful residence it is! 
14:30 For they set up rivals to God 

to lead others astray from His way. 

Say to them, O Prophet : 

Enjoy yourselves in life ! 

For, indeed, your ultimate destiny 

is the Fire of Hell. 
i4:3i Yet to My servants who believe, 

say that they should duly establish the Prayer 

and spend charitably 

from what We have provided them, 

secretly and openly, 

before there comes a Day Hereafter 



426

in which there shall be 
no gainful trade nor availing friendship. 
14:32 God is the One 

who alone has created the heavens 
and the earth 

and who alone has sent down, 

from the sky, water. 

Then He brought forth with it 

the fruits of the earth as a provision for you. 

Moreover, He has subjugated for you ships 

to run upon the sea, by His command. 

And He has subjugated for you 

the flowing rivers. 
14:33 And He has subjugated for you 

the sun and the moon, 

both constant in their courses . 

And He has subjugated for you 

the night and the daylight. 
14:34 Thus has He given y ou 

of all that you have asked Him. 

And were you to endeavor 

to count the blessings of God, 

never could you enumerate them. 

Indeed, the disbelieving human being 

is a relentless wrongdoer, 

godless in heart and utterly ungrateful. 

14:35 Now behold! 

Abraham said: My Lord! 

Make this land ofMakkah secure. 

And keep me and my children 

far away from worshipping idols. 
14:36 My Lord! 

Indeed, they have led many of the people astray 

from Your way .

I have placed some of my offspring 
to dwell in a valley that is infertile 
near Your Sacred House, 
our Lord, as You have commanded , 
so that they may duly establish the Prayer

So make the hearts of the people

14:38 Our Lord! 

Indeed, You know all that we conceal 

and all that we reveal — 

for not a single thing 

is ever concealed from God 

in the earth, nor in the heaven. 
14:39 All praise is for God alone

IBRAHIM - THE PROPHET ABRAHAM 



14:42 Thus never think, O Prophet, 
that God is heedless 

of all that the godless wrongdoers are doing. 

Indeed, He only defers punishment for them 

to a Day Hereafter when eyes shall bulge out 
at the great horror they behold. 
14:43 Frantic as they are rushing forward — 

necks outstretched , heads upraised — 

their gazes never return to them, 

and their hearts are an abyss. 
14:44 So forewarn humankind, O Prophet, 

of a Day Hereafter when the torment of Hell 

shall come to them. 

Then those who disbelieved 

and thus wronged themselves shall say: 

Our Lord! 

Defer Judgment on us for a short while. 
We shall answer Your call 
and follow the messengers sent to us! 
It will be said to them: 

Did you not use to swear before that for you 
there would be no passing away 

into an Afterlife ? 
14:45 Moreover, 

you dwelled in the very dwellings 

of those who had before you 

wronged themselves. 

Thus it was made clear to you 

how We ultimately dealt with them. 

Indeed, We set forth examples 

of their doom for you in Our revelations. 
But you were heedless . 
14:46 And truly they had devised their evil plan, 

each community against their messenger . 
Yet the full knowledge of their plan 




429 



SURAH 14 1 IBRAHIM - THE PROPHET ABRAHAM

was ever with God. 

And never was their plan 
even so much as to move mountains, 

let alone to thwart God i 
14:47 So never think, O Prophet, 

that God will ever fail His promise 

to uphold His messengers. 

Indeed, God is overpowering, all-avenging. 
14:48 On a Day Hereafter 

when the Earth will be changed 

into another Earth, smooth and pure white , 

and so too the heavens shall be changed — 

and they who are in the earth 

shall all come forward 

for Judgment before God, 

the One, the All-Dominating. 
14:49 Then shall you see, O Prophet, 

the defiant unbelievers on that Day 

coupled in fetters — 
14:50 their coats made of pitch, 

the Fire enveiling their faces — 
i4:5i so that God may recompense each soul 

with what it has earned in life . 

Indeed, God is swift in reckoning. 

14:52 This Quran is a declaration for all people. 
And it is thus , 

so that they may be forewarned by it; 

and so that they may know certainly 

that He who sent it is, indeed, the One God; 

and so that those who are endowed 

with discretion and understanding 

may heed its admonition 

and be ever mindful implementing it .

Never do We send messenger-angels

for denying truth. 
Yet, then, they would be given

Indeed, it is We alone

15:92 Yet, by your Lord, 

We shall, most surely, question them 

in the Hereafter — all of them — 
15:93 about whatever evil they used to do in life ! 
15:94 So proclaim that which 

you have been commanded to convey , 

and turn away from the idolaters. 
15:95 For, indeed, We shall suffice you 

against all the mockers, 
15:96 those who assign along with God any other god. 

Yet shall they all come to know 

the penalty of unbelief . 
15:97 And very truly, 

We know that your breast is constrained 

by what they say. 
15:98 Yet highly exalt your Lord with all praise. 

And be always of those 

who bow their faces down to the ground . 
15:99 And worship your Lord thus — 

until the certainty of death comes to you.

IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE ALL-MERCIFUL, THE MERCY-GIVING 



16:1 God's decree of Judgment 

will, most surely, come to pass. 

So do not seek to hasten it. 

Highly exalted is He, and most high, 

far above all that they associate 

as gods with Him . 
16:2 He alone sends down the angels, 

with the divine inspiration of His command, 

to whomever He so wills 

of His chosen servants, saying to them : 

You shall forewarn the people 

that there is no God but Me. 

So fear Me, all of you ! 
16:3 He alone created the heavens and the earth 

with the very essence of all truth. 

Most high is He 

far above all that they associate 

as gods with Him . 
16:4 He alone 

has created man from a mere sperm-drop. 

Then, behold! 

He becomes openly contentious 
against his Creator !

16:5 And as for cattle of every kind , 

He alone has created them for you. 

In them are means of warmth for you , 

and numerous other benefits. 

From them, also, you eat, 
16:6 while in them, you find glorious beauty 

when you drive them home 

in the evening to rest 

and when you lead them out 

in the morning to pasture. 
16:7 Moreover, they carry your heavy loads to lands 

you would never have otherwise reached — 

except with much distress to yourselves. 

Indeed, your Lord is all-kind, mercy-giving. 
16:8 Horses, mules, and donkeys 

He created , as well, that you may ride them 

and as worldly adornment for you . 

And, indeed, He alone creates 

that of which you do not know. 
16:9 Thus it is for God, your Creator, 

to set the straight path for His seekers ; 

for some paths are aberrant. 

Yet had He so willed, He would, most surely, 

have guided all of you, without choice — 
i6:io just as He alone is the One 

who sends down, from the sky, water for you, 

from which there is a drink you require, 

and from which plants grow, 

wherein you must pasture your herds . 
i6:ii Thereby, He alone 

causes to grow for you all types of crops — 

and olive trees and date palms 

and grapevines and fruits of every kind. 

Indeed, in all of this there is a sure sign

And the stars too are subjugated for you 

by His sole command. 

Indeed, in all of this there are sure signs

16:13 Thus, all creation 

has He alone multiplied for you

Indeed, in all of this there is a sure sign

who has subjugated the sea for you ,

and from it you bring forth 

ornaments that you wear. 

Thus you see the ships 

which you sail plowing through it, 

so that you may seek of His bounty, 

and that, therefore , 

you might give thanks to God alone . 
16:15 Moreover, 

He cast into the Earth anchoring mountains 

to balance it , so that it does not sway 

with you upon it as it spins ; 

and He made rivers and roadways, 

so that you may be guided therein .

Will you not, then, become mindful

16:18 Thus were you to endeavor 

to count the blessings of God, 

never could you enumerate them. 

Indeed, God alone is, most surely, 

all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 

16:19 Thus God knows well

16:20 Yet those whom they call upon

God knows well all that they conceal

as well as a portion of the burdens of sin 

of those whom they led astray in life, 

for they misled them 

without revealed knowledge. 

Most assuredly, evil is the load they shall bear! 
16:26 Truly, those who disbelieved before them 

also schemed against their messengers . 

But God brought down their building 

from their very foundations. 

Then from above them 

the roof fell down upon them. 

Thus the torment came upon them 

from where they did not perceive it . 
16:27 Then on the Day of Resurrection, 

He will disgrace them, for He will say: 

Where, now , are My associate-gods, 

for whose sake you have fiercely opposed 

the believers ? 

Those who had been given 

revealed knowledge in life will say: 

Indeed, this Day disgrace and evil 

shall be heaped upon the disbelievers. 
16:28 Those whose souls the angels take in death , 

while they are still wronging themselves 

with unbelief , 

will seek then to offer full submission, saying : 
We were not doing any evil! 
The angels will say to them: 
Yes, indeed, you were !

16:30 ifcNow, whenever it is said 

to those who are God-fearing: 

What has your Lord sent down in the Quran ? 

They say: All that is good! 

So for those who do good in this world, 

there shall be great goodness in life . 

And, most surely, the abode of the Hereafter 

is far better still — 

for most excellent, indeed, 

is the abode of the God-fearing! 
i6:3i Gardens everlasting shall they enter, 

beneath which rivers flow. 

They shall have therein whatever they wish. 

Thus does God reward the God-fearing. 
16:32 Those whose souls the angels take in death 

while they are good and virtuous, 

they shall say to them : Peace be upon you! 

Enter the Garden of Paradise 

for all the good 

that you have been doing in the world. 

16:33 Then do those who disbelieve 

await anything other than for the angels 

to come to them with death , 

or for the command of your Lord 

to come with their doom ? 

That is just what those 

disbelieving generations before them did. 

Thus God did not wrong them 

in punishing them . 

But, rather, it was their own souls 

they were all the while wronging 

with ungodliness .

16:34 Thus the evil consequence 

of all that they themselves had done in life 

shall have struck them in the Hereafter . 

For the very punishment 

at which they used to mock 

shall have whelmed them from every side. 
16:35 Yet those who associate gods with God say: 

Had God so willed 

we would not have worshipped anything 

apart from Him, 

neither we nor our forefathers. 

Nor would we have made anything unlawful 

without authority from Him. 

That is just what those disbelieving generations 

before them did argue as well — 

contrary to Our revealed guidance . 

Should the messengers, then, 

be obliged by God with more 

than the clear conveyance of His message ? 
16:36 Indeed, We have sent forth 

among every community a messenger 

with the commandment : 

You shall worship God alone 

and shun all false deities 

and objects of worship ! 

So among them were those people 

whom God guided aright . 

And among them were those 

who persistently rejected guidance. 

Thus they deservedly remained astray. 

So journey in the earth, 

and see how devastating was the end 

of those who belied God!

are profoundly eager for their guidance, 

know that God shall not guide

Thus for them, there shall not be any helpers

16:38 Moreover, they who disbelieve 

have sworn by God, 

with the utmost of their vows, 

that God will not raise to life anyone who dies. 

Yes, indeed, He will ! 

It is a true promise incumbent upon Him, 

though most people do not know it — 
16:39 wherefore He shall resurrect all people 

to make evident to them 
the reality of the Afterlife , 

which they now dispute; 

and that those who disbelieve 

will plainly know

And in no way could they elude 
the judgment of the Almighty . 
16:47 Or do they feel secure

all that is in the heavens, 
and all that is in the earth 
of every kind of beast that treads it — 
as do the angels — 

and they do not grow arrogant before Him . 
16:50 They fear their Lord up above them.

even two gods! 

For He is but One God. 

Thus it is Me alone you shall hold in awe! 
16:52 For to Him alone 

belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. 

Thus to Him alone belongs the sole right

Is it, then, other than God

By God! 

You shall, most surely, be questioned 
in the Hereafter 

about these lies you have forged. 
16:57 And as to the Arab idolaters, 

they ascribe daughters to God — 

highly exalted is He above this ! — 

while for themselves 

sons are all that they truly desire! 
16:58 Thus, whenever any of them 

is given the glad tidings of a female child , 

his very face grows dark, 

for he is filled with suppressed rage. 
16:59 He hides himself from the people 

because of the bad tidings that he was given. 

Should he keep it, with disgrace, 

or bury it alive in the dust? 

Most assuredly, so very grievous 

is the judgment they make! 
16:60 Then how evil an attribution 

those who do not believe in the Hereafter 

make to God ! 

Yet to God alone 

belongs the most transcendent attribute. 
For He alone 

is the Overpowering One , the All- Wise. 
i6:6i Thus were God to hold people accountable 
in this world , 

in accordance with their wrongdoing, 

He would not leave on the surface of the earth

However, He defers them

that awaiting them in the Hereafter

Without doubt, 

for them the Fire of Hell awaits. 
And, most surely,

Very truly, We have sent revealed guidance

Yet Satan made 

all the evil that they were doing 

fair-seeming to them — 

and he is their patron in unbelief, 

enticing them to false worship

But for all of them, 

there is a most painful torment awaiting

16:64 And so it is, O Prophet, 

that We have sent down the Quran, 

as a Heavenly Book to you, 

specifically to make clear to them 

the imperatives of faith , 

about which they dispute. 

Thus it is, indeed, a guidance to salvation ,

In cattle of every kind 

there is, indeed, a sure lesson for you. 

We give you to drink 

of what is within their bellies — 

produced alongside excretion and blood — 

a pure milk, 

pleasingly palatable to those who drink it. 
16:67 And you drink, as well, 

of the fruit of date palms and grapevines, 

from which you make an intoxicating beverage 

as well as wholesome provision. 

Indeed, in all of this there is a sure sign 

for a people who would use their reason 

to understand. 
16:68 Moreover, your Lord has revealed to the bees: 

Take dwellings for yourselves 

in the mountains and in the trees, 

and in the hives 

that people construct for you . 
16:69 Then eat of every fruit you desire , 

and go through the pathways of your Lord, 

made easy for you . 

There issues from their insides 

a sweet fluid, its colors varying, 

in which there is healing for people. 

Indeed, in all of this there is a sure sign 

for a people who would reflect 

on the wonder of creation .

Yet some of you are reduced by old age 
to the most abject state of life before death , 
such that one, after having had knowledge, 
will not know anything. 
Indeed, God is all-knowing, all-powerful. 
i6:7i Now , God has favored some of you 

above others in abundance of provision. 
Yet those so favored would never think 
to hand over all their own provision 
to bondservants they rightfully possess, 
so that all of them 

might become equal partners therein. 
How could they, then, 

assume to ascribe partners as equals to God, 

and thereby deny 

God's own blessings upon them ? 
16:72 Yet it is God alone who has made for you 

from among yourselves pairs, male and female . 

And He has made for you from your mates 

children and grandchildren. 

He has provided you, moreover, 

with all that is wholesome in life . 

Then is it in falsehood they shall believe, 

while in the blessings of God they disbelieve? 
16:73 For they worship apart from God 

what holds not even a drop or grain 

of provision for them 

in all the heavens and the earth — 

and what are utterly unable 

to provide even for themselves . 
16:74 So do not set forth any likeness to God. 

Indeed, God knows, and you do not know.

who has no power over anything, 

and another who is free , 

whom We have provided

such that he spends charitably from it 

in private and in public. 

Are they equal in worldly status ? 

All praise is for God alone , 

but most of them are disbelievers 

and do not know God . 
16:76 God sets forth another parable of two men: 

One of them is mute, incapable of anything. 

Moreover, he is an utter burden on his guardian; 

for wherever he directs him, he brings no good. 

Is he equal to one who bids to justice, 

while he himself is guided 

upon a straight way of salvation ? 
16.77 Indeed, to God alone belongs the knowledge 

of all the unseen realities 

of the heavens and the earth. 

Thus the matter of the Hour of Doom 

is never farther off 

than the twinkling of an eye — or nearer still! 

For, indeed, God is powerful over all things. 
16:78 Moreover, it is God alone 

who has brought you forth 

from the bellies of your mothers 

knowing nothing at all . 

Yet He made for you the faculties of 

hearing, and sight, and hearts that comprehend , 

so that you may learn and give thanks. 
16:79 Do they who deny God 

not look upon the flying birds — 

made to master flying in the air of the sky?

Moreover, it is God alone who has enabled you 
to make for yourselves houses 
as places of rest and residence. 
And He has enabled you 
to make for yourselves tents 
from the hides of cattle, 
which you find light to carry 
on your day of journeying 
and on the day you encamp. 
And for you in cattle , 
in their wool, fur, and hair, 
are manifold furnishings and utility, 
for a preordained time. 
Moreover, it is God alone 
who provides shade for you, 
out of that which He has created. 
And He has made for you 
places of refuge in the mountains. 
And He has made for you garments 
that shield you from heat and the elements , 
as well as armored garments 
that shield you from harm in your battles. 
And so it is 

that He perfects His blessings upon you, 

so that you may submit yourselves 

to Him alone in worship . 
16:82 Yet if they turn away from this message , 

then what is incumbent upon you, O Prophet, 

is only the clear conveyance of God's word . 
16:83 They well recognize the blessing of God. 

Then they thanklessly belie it 

by turning to false gods , 

for most of them are disbelievers.

Nor will they then be allowed 

to propitiate the wrath of God 

for their ungodliness . 
16:85 And when at last the godless wrongdoers 

see the torment of Hell, then will they realize 

that it shall never be lightened for them, 

nor shall they be reprieved. 
16:86 Moreover, when those who associated gods 

with God in the world 

see their associate-gods on Judgment Day , 

they will say: Our Lord! 

These are our associate-gods 

that we used to call upon apart from You. 

Then their alleged gods 

will cast their word back upon them, saying: 

Indeed, you are, most surely, liars! 
16:87 Thus they who in their lifetimes disbelieved 

will proffer to God, on that Day, 

full submission. 

For all the false gods that they used to forge 
shall have strayed from them. 

16:88 So as to those who disbelieve 

and bar people from the path of God, 
We shall increase them on that Day 
with punishment, for their obstruction, 
on top of punishment, for their unbelief, 
for all the corruption

leave to stray whomever He so wills. 

And He alone guides whomever He so wills. 

For, most surely, all of you shall be questioned 

about what you have done in life . 
16:94 So do not take your oaths 

as instruments of deception between you, 

such that your foot should slip 

after it once had been set firm, 

and wherefore you would be given to taste 

the affliction of evil in this life 

for having barred others 

from coming to the way of God 

by your shameful example . 

Moreover, there would be for you 

in the Hereafter a great torment. 
16:95 So do not sell the covenant of God 

for a small price. 

Indeed, what is with God is far better for you, 
if only you were to know. 
16:96 All that is with you in life shall come to an end. 
But what is with God is everlasting — 
and We shall certainly recompense 
those who have remained patient 
with their reward, 

in accordance with the very best they ever did.

16:97 Whoever does righteous deeds, 

whether male or female, and is a believer, 

We shall, most surely, cause him 

to live a good life. 

Moreover, We shall, most surely, 

recompense all of them with their reward, 

in accordance with the very best they ever did. 

16:98 Thus, whenever you recite the Quran, 

then seek refuge in God from Satan, 

the accursed one . 
16:99 Yet, indeed, he has no authority whatever 

over those who believe 

and who rely upon their Lord alone . 
i6:ioo His authority is only over those 

who take him as a patron, and who, 

because of him, 

take associate-gods apart from God . 
i6:ioi Yet if ever We substitute one verse 
in place of another verse 
to benefit humankind — 
and God knows best what He sends down — 
they say: 

You, O Muhammad, are nothing but a forger! 
Rather, most of them do not know God's way . 
16:102 Say to them: Gabriel , the Holy Spirit, 
has brought it down from your Lord 
with the whole truth, to confirm in faith 
those who have believed, 
and as divine guidance from error , 
and a glad tiding 

of everlasting delight near their Lord 
for all those who are muslims, 
in willing submission to God alone .

We know that they say, O Prophet :

in the revealed signs of God, 
God shall not guide them aright . 
Thus for them, 

there is a most painful torment awaiting

16:105 As to the ones who forge such lies, 

they are the ones who do not believe

16:106 Doomed is one

But whoever

upon such as these 

there shall be great wrath from God.

VU SUmh tkat mentions the miracle °f THE NIGHT JOURNEY, wherein God 
* ^ transported His servant Muhammad d^L in a single night from the Sacred Mosque of 

Makkah to Al-Aqsa Mosque in ferusalem, to show him some of His most wondrous signs. 



Surah 17 m 



11 VERSES / REVEALED AT MAKKAH 



Al-Isra' 



I N THE NAME OF GOD, THE ALL-MERCIFUL, THE MERCY-GIVING 



17:1 Highly exalted is He 

who carried His servant, Muhammad, by night 

from the Sacred Mosque at Makkah 

to Al-Aqsa Mosque at Jerusalem — 

the surroundings of which We have blessed — 

to show him something 

of Our wondrous signs. 

Indeed, it is He 

who is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. 

17:2 And so too We gave Moses 
the Book of the Torah , 
and We made it a guide 

for the Children of Israel, commanding them : 

You shall not take any deity apart from Me 

for a guardian — 
17:3 for you are of the offspring of those 

whom We carried in the Ark with Noah, 

who was, indeed, 

an ever-thankful servant of God . 
17:4 Yet We had foretold to the Children of Israel 

in the Book of the Torah : 

You shall, most surely, 



467

17:7 



cause corruption in the land two times 
and be punished by God . 
For, most surely, you shall grow haughty 
and act with a great haughtiness. 
17:5 Then when the promise 

of the first of the two times came to pass , 
We sent against you servants of Ours 
endowed with mighty military power. 
Thus they ravaged through the dwellings 
of your people — and it was a promise fulfilled. 
17:6 Thereafter, We restored you, once again, 
to prevalence over them, 
for We extended to you wealth and sons. 
Thus We made you greater than ever 
in number, saying : 
If you do good, 

you do good for your own souls. 
Yet if you do evil, 
so shall it be against yourselves . 
Thus when the promise 
of the second time came to pass, 
your enemies were left 
to defile your very faces. 
Indeed, they were left to enter 
the Temple of Jerusalem , 
as they had entered it the first time. 
Thus they were left to shatter 
all that they came upon — 
shattering it all utterly! 
It may well be that your Lord 
shall again show you mercy. 
Yet if you return 
to corruption and haughtiness , 
We will return to utter destruction . 
Moreover, We have made Hell

for all the disbelievers 

as a permanent place of confinement. 

17:9 Indeed, this Quran guides humanity 
to that which is most upright 
and gives glad tidings to the believers 
who do righteous deeds, 
that for them there is a great reward 
of everlasting delight in Paradise 
awaiting in the Hereafter . 

i7:io And it warns those who do not believe 
in the Hereafter, 

that We have made ready for them there 
a most painful torment. 
i7:ii Yet in anger man unknowingly 
invokes evil upon himself 
as eagerly as he invokes good. 
For man is, indeed, given to haste. 

17:12 Now, We made the night and the daylight 
as two great signs 

of your Lord's power and wisdom . 
Then We effaced the moon, 
the sign of the night, by the radiant sun — 
for We made it the sign of the daylight, 

to enable humankind therein to see — 
so that you may seek out bounty 
from your Lord; 

and so that you may come to know 
the number of years 
and methods of calculation. 
For each thing in Our creation 
and in Our revelation 
have We made distinct — utterly distinct. 
17:13 Moreover, We have securely bound the destiny

For We shall bring forth for each one 

a precise book of record of one's deeds 

on the Day of Resurrection, 

which one shall find there 

fully unfurled before him, 
17:14 whereupon it shall be said: 

Read your book for yourself! 

Sufficient is your soul this Day 

as a reckoner against you. 
17:15 Whoever is guided aright in the world , 

then he is but guided 

for the good of his own soul. 

Yet whoever goes astray, 

he but strays, then, against all that is good for it. 

For no sin-laden soul 

shall carry the sinful load of another 

on Judgment Day . 
Moreover, never do We 

beset people with torment 
until We send forth to them 
a messenger with Heavenly guidance . 
17:16 Thus when We intend to destroy a town 

for evildoing , 

We first command its affluent 

to become righteous . 

Yet should they continue to commit 

flagrant deeds of ungodliness therein, 
then the divine word of doom 
comes to pass against it. 
Then do We demolish it — 
and demolish it utterly. 
17:17 And how very many 

of the ungodly generations after Noah

did We destroy! 

Thus sufficient is your Lord, O Prophet, 

as One who is all-aware and all-seeing 

of the sins of His servants. 
17:18 Whoever desires this life of haste 
over the everlasting Hereafter , 

We shall hasten for him therein 

whatever of the world We so will, 

for whomever We intend. 

Then We shall appoint for him Hell. 

He shall enter it condemned, forever banished. 
17:19 But whoever desires 

the reward of the Hereafter — 

and duly strives for it 

with the striving rightfully due for it, 

while being a believer — 

then such as these 

shall find their striving forever thanked 

by their Lord . 
17:20 To each group — 

those who are hasty for the world 

and those who strive for God — 

We extend something of your Lord's bounty. 

Yet never is the bountiful gift of your Lord 

confined to either of them . 
17:21 Look, O Prophet, how We have already 

favored some of them with Our bounty 

over others. 

Yet, most surely, the Hereafter 

is of still greater ranks 

and far greater favor for the believers. 

17:22 O Prophet! 

You shall not set up any other god with God.

We have favored some human beings 
as prophets with divine revelation, 
setting them above others. 
Thus We gave David, a mere shepherd, 
a great kingdom and the Book of Psalms. 
17:56 So say to the unbelievers : 
Call in vain

whom you allege to be gods apart from Him. 

For they hold no authority whatever 

to remove harm from you, 

nor to turn it aside, should God decree it . 
17:57 Those whom they call upon 

are themselves seeking a way to their Lord, 

vying as to which of them 

shall draw nearest to Him with worship . 

Moreover, they hope ardently for His mercy — 

and, with dread, fear His torment. 

Indeed, the torment from your Lord 

is a thing of horror of which to beware. 
17:58 So know , there is not 

a single disbelieving town 

but that We shall destroy it 

before the Day of Resurrection, 

or punish it for its sinfulness 

with a severe punishment. 

This has been inscribed 

in the Preserved Book of Heaven .

For We gave to the people of Thamud 
the miraculously created she-camel — 
brought forth before their very eyes — 
and still they wronged her. 
Nor do We send forth miraculous signs 
except to put the fear of God 
in people's hearts . 
17:60 Thus behold! We said to you, O Prophet : 
Indeed, your Lord's dominion 
encompasses all people. 
Yet We did not make 
the wondrous vision We showed you 
when you ascended to Heaven 
but as a trial for all people. 
And the mention in the Quran 
of the Impalatable Tree of Zaqqum , 
the cursed tree of Hell, 
is likewise such a test for the disbelievers, 
by which We put the fear of God upon them. 
Yet it does not increase them in faith , 
but only in great transgression.

Bow your faces down to receive Adam

So they all bowed down, except Iblis. 
He said:

with your voice.

For the human being is an unbelieving ingrate. 
17:68 Do you, then, feel secure that He will not cause 
the seacoast to sink under you, 
or send down upon you a raging storm 
of lethal pellets- — 

whereupon you would not find for yourselves 
any guardian to shield you ? 
17:69 Or do you feel secure 

that He will not return you to the sea 
yet another time, 

then loose the wind of a hurricane 

upon you and drown you 

because of your ungratefulness — 

whereupon you would not find for yourselves 

anyone to pursue vengeance for this against Us? 
17:70 4ft Yet very truly, We have so honored 

the Children of Adam: 

For We have carried them 

through the land and the sea. 

And We have provided them 

with all that is wholesome in life . 

And We have so favored them 

above most of what We have created 

with such immense favor. 
i7:7i Yet the Day comes 

when We shall call upon every people 

by their leaders. 

Thus whoever is given his book of deeds 
in his right hand, then such as these 
shall read their book joyfully — 
and never shall they be wronged 
in their reward even a whit.

is blind in heart to the truth , 
thus shall he be raised up blind

you would consume yourself, 

sorrowing upon their traces, 

if they will not believe in this divine discourse. 

Know that , indeed, 
We have made all that is on the earth 
as an adornment for it — 

only to test them 

as to which of them is best in deed. 
For, certainly, at the end of time 
We shall most surely make 
all that is on it a barren plain of dust.

Now, O Prophet, do you deem the account

who took shelter in the cave

So We increased them in guidance.

when they stood before their people 

and proclaimed: 

Our Lord is the only Lord 

of the heavens and the earth! 

Therefore, never shall we call upon 

any god apart from Him! 

For very truly, we would have then uttered 

an outrageous lie! 
18:15 These, our people, have taken gods in worship 

apart from Him who alone is the One God . 

If only they would come forth 

with manifest authority

For who does a greater wrong 

than one who forges lies against God?

Since you have withdrawn from them, 

and from what they worship other than God, 

then take shelter in the cave. 

Your Lord will unfold for you 

something of His mercy, 

and He will furnish you

while their dog stretched forth his forelegs 
at the threshold. 

Were you to have come upon them, 
most surely, you would have frantically 
turned away from them in flight, 
for you would have been filled with horror

Thus they questioned each other. 
One of them said to the others : 
How long have you remained asleep? 
Some said: 

We only remained so for a day, 
or some part of a day- 
Some of the others, said: 
Your Lord knows best

And never ever would you succeed, then,

Build a perimeter wall around them

what is to become of them. 
But those who prevailed

So do not argue about them,

just as We have created you the first time. 
Yet in life you alleged 
that We would never occasion 
such an appointment 
for resurrecting you! 
18:49 Then the precise book of record 
for their deeds 

will be set in place for each one . 
Thus you shall see the defiant unbelievers 
terrified of what is in it, and they will be saying: 
Woe to us! 

What is with this book 

that leaves out no act, be it small or great, 

without having enumerated it? 

For they will find 

all that they have ever done in their lives 
present before them . 

Nor shall your Lord wrong anyone in the least . 

18:50 Now, behold! We said to the angels: 

Bow your faces down to receive Adam 



500 



part fifteen 



SURAH 1 8 I AL-KAHF - THE CAVE 



into life and honor him ! 
So they all bowed down, except Iblis, 
who was of the jinn. 
Thus he rebelled 
against the command of his Lord. 
Will you human beings 
then take him and his seed as patrons 
apart from Me while they are an enemy to you? 
How woeful a substitute this is 
for the wrongdoers who are godless in heart ! 
i8:5i ^1 did not call any of them 

to witness the creation of the heavens 
and the earth, 

nor even the creation of their own selves. 

Nor would I ever take 

the evil misleaders as assistants. 
18:52 Thus on that Day He shall say to them : 

Call upon My associate-gods 

whom you have alleged! 

So they will call upon them. 

But they will not answer them. 

Thus shall We set perdition between them. 
18:53 Then the defiant unbelievers 

will see the Fire of Hell , 

and they will realize with certainty 

that they are about to fall into it. 

Yet they will find no escape from it. 

18:54 Now truly, indeed, 

We have varied in this Quran 

something of every kind of illustration 

for the good of all people. 

Yet of all things man is most argumentative. 
18:55 For there is nothing to prevent 

people from believing, 



501 



SURAH It! I AL-KA1 IF - THE CAVE 



part fifteen 



now that the Heavenly guidance 

of the Quran has come to them. 
Nor is there anything to prevent them 
from seeking forgiveness from their Lord, 
except that the obstinate ways of unbelief 
of the earlier generations 

reemerge and overcome them — 
or the punishment of God, 
at last, comes to them face to face. 
18:56 Thus We do not send the messengers 
except as bearers of glad tidings 

to the believers 

of everlasting delight in Paradise , 
and as forewarners to the disbelievers 
of God's nearing Judgment . 
But those who disbelieve 
obstinately argue 

in accordance with a logic of falsehood 
by which they seek to refute the truth. 
Thus do they take My revealed signs — 
and whatever divine punishment 
of which they are forewarned — as a mockery. 
18:57 Yet who does a greater wrong 

than one who is made mindful of the truth 

by the very verses of his Lord, 

but who then turns away from them, 

forgetting the sins that his own hands 

have advanced into the Hereafter? 

Therefore , We have, indeed, 

placed sheaths over their ill-inclined hearts — 

that they may no longer understand 

this Quran — 

and in their ears an utter deafness. 

So though you call them to faith, O Prophet, 

by means of this Heavenly guidance — 



E

SURAH 1 8 I AL-KAHF - THE CAVE 



still, never shall they be guided, ever. 
18:58 Yet your Lord 

is the All-Forgiving, the Possessor of Mercy. 
For were He to seize them, suddenly, 
in accordance with the sins 
that they have earned, 
He would certainly hasten on 
the torment for them. 
But, rather, they have an appointed time 
for Judgment — 

apart from which they shall never find asylum. 
18:59 And so it was with all such communities 
that We destroyed when they did wrong: 
We set an appointed time for their destruction. 

18:60 Now, behold! 

Moses said to his young attendant: 
I will not quit my quest for knowledge 
until I reach the confluence of the two seas, 
or else I shall go on for ages. 

i8:6i So when they reached the confluence 
between them, there they rested, 
and forgot their fish — 
that they brought for sustenance — 
which then made its way into the sea, 
slipping away wondrously . 

18:62 So after they had proceeded and left it behind, 
he said to his young attendant: 
Bring us our midday meal. 
Very truly, 

we have encountered great weariness 
in this journey of ours. 
18:63 He said to Moses : 
Do you remember 

when we betook ourselves to the rock to rest ? 




503 



SURAH 18 I AL-KAHF - THE CAVE

18:64 



Indeed, I forgot the fish there — 
and none but Satan caused me to forget it, 
and to forget that I should mention it to you . 
For it had made its way 
into the sea so wondrously. 
Moses said: 
This is the sign that we have been seeking! 
So they turned back, 
retracing their footsteps to the rock . 
18:65 And there they found a distinguished servant, 
from among Our servants; 
for We had granted him mercy 
from Our providence ; 
and We had taught him much knowledge 
from Our own, 
18:66 Moses said to him: 
May I follow you 
on condition that you teach me 
whatever right guidance 
you have been taught by God? 
18:67 God's servant said: 

Indeed, you can never be patient enough 
to bear with me. 
18:68 For how can you be patient 

with an experience you do not comprehend? 
Moses said: 

You shall find me, if God so wills, patient. 
Nor will I disobey any command of yours. 
God's servant said: 
Then if you would follow me, 
then do not question me about anything I do 
until I first make mention 
of the reason for it to you. 
i8:7i So they proceeded.

when they embarked in a ship, he scuttled it. 
Moses said: 

Have you scuttled it to drown its people? 

Very truly, you have done a grievous thing! 
18:72 He said to Moses : 

Did I not say that, indeed, 

you can never be patient enough 

to bear with me? 
18:73 Moses said: 

Do not hold me accountable 

for what I have forgotten, 

nor burden me with further difficulty 

in my endeavor to learn from you . 
18:74 So they proceeded. 

And at last, 

when they met a boy, he killed him. 
Moses said: 

Have you killed an innocent soul 

without cause of retribution for another soul? 

Very truly, you have done a horrific thing! 
18:75 vfcHe said to Moses : 

Did I not say to you that, indeed, 

you can never be patient enough 

to bear with me? 
18:76 Moses said: 

If, after this, 

I question you about anything else , 

then no longer keep me in your company. 

You have already 

attained enough excuse-making on my part. 
18:77 So they proceeded.

they requested food 

from the hospitality of its people.

But they refused to host them. 

So they found in it a wall ready to topple over, 

thus he reinforced it and set it upright. 

Moses said: 

Had you wished, 

you could have taken pay for it. 
18:78 God's servant said: 

This is the parting between me and you. 

I shall now tell you 

the reality of the interpretation 

of all that you could not abide with patience. 
18:79 As for the ship, 

it belonged to indigent people working at sea. 

Thus I intended only to slightly impair it, 

for I knew that behind them 

was a disbelieving king 

seizing every seaworthy ship by force. 
18:80 And as for the boy, 

his parents were true believers; 

and based on revealed knowledge 

we feared that he would oppress them 

with transgression and unbelief. 
i8:8i Thus we desired 

that their Lord should grant them instead 

another son far better than him 

in the purity of his heart 

and closer to them in loving-mercy. 
18:82 And as for the wall, 

it belonged to two orphan boys in the city 

and beneath it was a treasure hidden for them. 

Now their father was a righteous man; 

so your Lord intended 

for both to reach full maturity 

and to bring forth their treasure for themselves, 

as a mercy from your Lord. 



506

SURAH 1 8 I AL-KAHF - THE CAVE 



Moreover, I did not do any of this 
on my own authority. 
That is the interpretation of these deeds , 
for which you could not be patient. 

18:83 They ask you, as well, O Prophet, 

about Dhul-Qarnayn. Say: 

I will recite for you an account of him 

for your reflection . 
18:84 Indeed, We established ascendancy for him 

in the land. 

Moreover, 

We endowed him with magnificent means 
to attain a way 

to nearly all things he endeavored . 
18:85 So he followed a way westward . 
18:86 And at last, when he reached the place 

of the setting sun, 

he found it setting, as it were, 

in the midst of a black, turbid spring; 

and he found nearby it a wrongdoing people. 

We said: O Dhul-Qarnayn! 

You may, in regard to them, 

either punish them 

or treat them with goodness. 
18:87 He said: 

As for whoever does wrong, 

we shall punish him. 

Then he shall be returned to his Lord 

in the Hereafter , and He shall punish him 

with a horrific punishment. 
18:88 But as for one who believes 

and works righteous deeds, 

there shall be for him great goodness in reward. 

Moreover, in all that we shall decree for him 




507 



SURAH 1 J I AL-KAHF - THE CAVE

of our commands, there shall be ease. 

18:89 Then he followed a way eastward . 
18:90 And at last, when he reached the place 
of the rising sun, 

he found it rising upon a primitive people 

for whom We had set nothing 

as a veil to keep them out of it. 
18.-91 That is so, for truly We comprehended 

whatever he encountered as an experience. 
18:92 Then he followed another way. 
18:93 And at last, when he reached a place 

between two mountain barriers, 

he found alongside them a simple people 

who could barely understand a word 

of any language but their own . 
18:94 They said: O Dhul-Qarnayn! 

Indeed, the people of Gog and Magog 

are sowers of corruption in the land! 

So may we offer you tribute, 

on condition that you make 

between us and them a barrier? 
18:95 He said: 

That with which my Lord has established me 

is far better than any tribute . 

But aid me with manpower. 

I shall set between you and them a bulwark. 
18.96 Bring me chunks of iron. 

Then when he leveled up the passage 

between the two mountain cliffs with it , 

he said: 

Blow with your bellows ! 
Then when he had set it afire, he said: 
Bring me molten brass to pour on it.

were unable to scale it, 
nor could they tunnel through it. 
18:98 He said: This is a mercy from my Lord. 
But when the promise of my Lord 
comes to pass on Judgment Day , 
He shall turn it into rubble. 
And the promise of my Lord is ever true. 

18:99 -Sic For We shall let some of them on that Day 
surge over the earth against others. 
And then the Trumpet of Resurrection 
shall be blown. 

Then We shall gather them all in , 

in one single gathering. 
i8:ioo And on that Day We shall bring Hell 

to the disbelievers, on display — 
i8:ioi for those whose eyes were 

shrouded in a veil of unbelief 

against seeing the signs 

of My remembrance in life . 

Nor were they able to hear them 

in God's revelations or from His messengers . 
18:102 Do those who disbelieve 

think that they may take My servants 

as patrons, apart from Me? 

Indeed, 

We have prepared Hell for the disbelievers 

as an everlasting hospitality. 
18:103 Say to them : 

Shall We tell you about the greatest losers 

with respect to deeds? 
18:104 It is those whose striving 

has strayed from God's way 

in the life of this world, 

while they yet think 




509 



SURAH i 3 I AL-KAHF - THE CAVE

that they are doing most excellent work. 
18:105 These are the ones who have disbelieved 

in the revealed signs of their Lord 

and who deny resurrection 

and His inevitable Meeting 

for Judgment in the Hereafter . 

Thus their good works 

are rendered utterly futile with God . 

For on the Day of Resurrection, 

We shall not give to them any weight at all . 
18:106 That shall be their recompense: Hell! — 

for having disbelieved 

and taken My revealed signs 

and My messengers in mockery. 
18:107 As for those who believe 

and do righteous deeds, 

for them there are the Gardens of Paradise 

awaiting as an everlasting hospitality. 
18:108 Therein they shall abide forever. 

Therefrom, they shall never seek removal. 
18:109 Say, O Prophet, to one and all : 

If the sea were as ink for the words of my Lord, 

most surely, the sea would be depleted 

before the words of my Lord were depleted — 

even if We were to bring the like of it 

in replenishment. 
i8:iio Say to all people, O Prophet : 

Indeed, I am only a human being like you. 

It is revealed to me that, indeed, 

your God is only One God. 

So whoever has hope 

for the Meeting of his Lord in the Hereafter , 
then let him do righteous deeds 
and not associate 

in the worship of his Lord anyone.

This is a reminder of your Lord's mercy

Behold! 

He entreated his Lord in secret entreaty. 
He said: My Lord! 
Indeed, enfeebled with age 
are the bones within me, 
and my head is lit with gray. 
Yet never, in calling upon You, 
my Lord, have I been unhappy. 
Indeed, I fear 

for the right guidance of my kinsfolk 
to come after me; for my wife is barren. 
So grant to me, 

from Your own plenteous bounty, a successor 

to inherit prophethood from me 

and to inherit it from the Family of Jacob. 

And make him, my Lord, 

well-pleasing to You and to Your servants. 

God said : O Zachariah! 

Indeed, We give you glad tidings of a boy

whose name shall be John. 

To no other before 

have We appointed his name. 
19:8 He said: My Lord! 

How shall I have a boy while my wife is barren, 

and truly I have reached 

a state of advanced old age? 
19:9 It was said: Even so shall it be! 

Your Lord has said: 

It is easy for Me, 

for, truly, I have created you before, 
and you were nothing. 
i9:io He said: My Lord! 

Appoint for me a sign that this will be ! 
He said: 

Your sign is that 

you shall not be able to speak to people 

for three straight nights 

though you shall have no ailment . 
i9:ii So Zachariah came forth to his people 

from the Sanctuary unable to speak . 

Thus he signed to them 

that you shall highly exalt God , 

morning and evening. 
19:12 God said: O John! 

Take hold of the Heavenly Book 

with utmost power! 

Thus We gave him prophetic wisdom 

as a child; 

19:13 and tenderness, from Our own providence ; 

and purity, as well ; for he was ever God-fearing 
19:14 and virtuous toward his parents. 

Thus he was neither insolent nor disobedient. 
19:15 So may peace be upon him 

the day he was born and the day he dies

and the Day he is raised to life in the Hereafter . 

19:16 And mention in the Book, O Prophet, 
the tiding of Mary. 
Behold! 

She withdrew from her family 

to an eastern place, 
19:17 and she placed a veil between herself and them. 

Then We sent to her Our Spirit, 
the Angel Gabriel, 

who thus appeared to her 

as a flawless human being. 
19:18 She said: 

Indeed, I seek refuge from you 

in God, the All-Merciful, 

if at all you be God-fearing! 
19:19 He said: 

Indeed, I, myself, am none other 

than a messenger of your Lord 

to grant to you a pure boy. 
19:20 She said: 

How shall I have a boy, 

while no human being has ever touched me, 

nor have I ever been unchaste? 
i9:2i The angel said: Even so shall it be! 

Your Lord has said: It is easy for Me. 

For We shall make him 

a miraculous sign for all people, 

and a mercy from Us. 

Thus it is a matter decreed. 
19:22 S&amp;So she conceived him, 

and withdrew heavy with him 

to a remote place. 
19:23 And the birth pangs drove her 

to the trunk of a date-palm.

She said: Oh, alas for me! 
Would that I had died before this 
and become a thing utterly forgotten! 
19:24 Then he who was newly born called to her, 
from beneath her: Oh, do not sorrow! 
Indeed, your Lord 

has already made flow beneath you a streamlet. 
19:25 Moreover, shake toward yourself 
the trunk of the date-palm, 

and it shall drop freshly ripened dates upon you. 
19:26 So eat and drink and cool your eye. 
And if you should see 
any human being, then say only : 
Indeed, I have vowed a fast to the All-Merciful. 
Thus, I shall not speak today 
to any human being. 

19:27 Thereafter, she came with him 
to her people, carrying him. 
They said: O Mary! 
Very truly, you have come forth 
with a thing of unimaginable horror ! 
O sister of Aaron! 
Your father was not an evil person. 
Nor was your mother unchaste. 
So she pointed them to him. 
They said: 
How shall we speak 
to one who is yet in the cradle, 
a mere infant of a boy? 
19:30 He said: 

Indeed, I am the servant of God! 
He has given me the Scripture. 
And He has made me a prophet. 
i9:3i And, thus, has He made me blessed,

wherever I may be. 

And further , He has enjoined me 

to be ever observant of the Prayer, 

and to give the Zakat-Charity, 

as long as I am alive — 
19:32 and to be ever virtuous toward my mother. 

For He has made me 

neither insolent nor wretched. 
19:33 So may all peace be upon me, 

and those who confirm me, 

the day I was born and the day I die 

and the Day I am raised to life in the Hereafter . 

19:34 That is Jesus, son of Mary! 

It is the whole word of truth, 
about which they 

who lay claim to the Scripture bitterly contend. 
19:35 It is not for God to take any son. 

Highly exalted is He above this ! 

When He decrees a matter, 

He but says to it: Be! And so it is. 
19:36 Thus Jesus but said to his people : 

Indeed, God is my Lord and your Lord. 

So worship Him alone . 

This is a straight way to salvation . 

19:37 Yet the sects of the People of the Scripture 
have disputed among themselves about Jesus . 
So woe to those who disbelieve — 
from the spectacle of an awesome Day! 

19:38 How well they shall hear and see 

on the Day they come to Us for Judgment ! 
Nevertheless, the godless wrongdoers this Day 
are utterly lost in clear misguidance. 

19:39 Thus forewarn them of the Day of Regret —

when the matter is done, 
and their destiny has been decreed — 
while they are yet heedless, 
and they do not believe. 
19:40 Indeed, it is but We who shall inherit the earth 
and all who are upon it — 
for to Us alone are they all returning. 

19:41 And mention also in the Book, O Prophet, 

the tiding of Abraham. 

Indeed, he was ever-truthful, 

and an eminent prophet. 
19:42 Behold! He said to his father: 

My dear father! 

Why do you worship 

what can neither hear, nor see, 

nor avail you in anything? 
19:43 My dear father! 

Indeed, revealed knowledge has come to me 

from God that has not reached you. 

So follow me, and I shall guide you 

to God and an even way. 
19:44 My dear father! Do not worship Satan. 

Indeed, Satan is ever rebellious 

toward the All-Merciful. 
19:45 My dear father! 

I fear that a torment 

from the All-Merciful will strike you. 

Thus you will become 

a doomed patron of Satan. 
19:46 He said: 

Are you averse to my gods, O Abraham? 

Most surely, if you do not desist, 

I will myself stone you to death . 

Therefore, depart from me now

for a long duration. 
19:47 Abraham said: Peace be with you! 

I shall ask my Lord to forgive you. 

Indeed, He has been ever gracious to me. 
19:48 Yet I shall withdraw from you 

and all that you call upon in worship 

apart from God. 

And with pure heart 

shall I call upon my Lord alone . 

Thus may it be that in calling upon my Lord 

I shall never be unhappy! 
19:49 So when he had withdrawn from them, 

and all that they worshipped apart from God, 

We granted to him Isaac, 

and, from Isaac, Jacob — 

and each one We made a prophet. 
19:50 Thus We granted them profusely 

out of Our mercy. 

For upon the tongues 

of succeeding generations , 

We did appoint for them 

a mention of exalted reverence for all time . 

i9:5i And mention also in the Book, O Prophet, 

the tiding of Moses. 

Indeed, he was chosen by God . 

Thus he was a messenger of resolve 

and an eminent prophet. 
19:52 Behold! 

We summoned him 

from the right side of Mount Tur. 

and thus did We bring him near 

for close converse. 
19:53 We granted to him, moreover,

Indeed, he was ever true to his promise. 

And he too was a messenger 
and an eminent prophet. 
19:55 He used to enjoin his family 

with the Prayer and the Zakat-Charity. 

Thus, to his Lord, he was ever-pleasing. 

19-.56 And mention also in the Book, O Prophet, 
the tiding of Idris. 
Indeed, he too was ever-truthful 

and an eminent prophet. 
19:57 Thus We raised him 

in name and station to a high place. 
19:58 These are some of the great ones 
upon whom God bestowed grace — 
from among the prophets of the seed of Adam, 
and from those whom We carried 

in the Ark with Noah, 
and from the seed of Abraham and Israel, 
and from those whom We guided to true faith 
and selected as prophets . 
When the verses of the All-Merciful 
were recited to them, they fell to the ground 

in worship of Him alone , 
bowing their faces down and weeping. || 

19:59 -s|c Then descending from them thereafter

and thus shall they meet with degradation —

and believes and does righteous deeds. 

They shall enter the Garden of Paradise —

Indeed, He is the One

and what is behind us and what is between this. 

Moreover, never is your Lord forgetful! 
19:65 He is Lord of the heavens and the earth 

and all that is between them. 

So worship Him alone ! 

And persevere patiently in His worship! 

Do you know any other 

who bears any semblance to Him? 

19:66 A disbelieving man says: 

Can it be that when I have died, 
I shall again be brought forth alive? 

19:67 Does man not remember 

that We, indeed, created him before,

and he was nothing? 
19:68 Then, by your Lord, as for the disbelievers , 
We shall, most surely, round them up, 
as well as all the satans. 
Then, most surely, 

We shall fetch them round Hell on their knees. 
19:69 Then, most surely, 

We shall pluck from every faction 

whichever of them was most intense 

in defying the All-Merciful. 
19.70 Then, assuredly, it is We who are most knowing 

about all those who are most deserving 

of roasting in it. 
19:71 And there is not one of you human beings 

but shall come to it. 

It is, with your Lord, an inevitability decreed. 
19.72 Then We shall deliver those 
who have been God-fearing. 
But We shall leave 

the godless wrongdoers in it, on their knees. 

1.9:73 For whenever Our revealed verses 
are recited to them with all clarity, 
those who have disbelieved 
invariably say to those who believe: 
Which of the two groups, ours or yours, 
is of a better station in the world 
and appears the fairer company? 

19:74 Yet how many 

a disbelieving generation before them 
have We destroyed for ungodliness 
who were of far fairer worldly furnishing 
and appearance? 

19:75 Say to them : 

Whichever of us is 



520 



part sixteen 



SURAH 1 9 I MAR YAM - MARY 



lost in uttermost misguidance, 
may the All-Merciful 
fully extend that duration for them. 
For at last, when they behold the fulfillment 
of what they have been promised — 
whether it be the torment 
of a worldly judgment 
or the Hour of Doom — 
then shall they know 
who is of a worse rank and weaker host! 
19:76 For God ever increases 

those who are guided aright in divine guidance. 

And abiding deeds of righteousness 

are far better in a reward 

with your Lord in the Hereafter ; 

and, therefore, far better 

in their ultimate return. 

19:77 Then have you seen, O Prophet, 

the one who disbelieved 

in Our revealed signs and said: 

I shall, most surely, be given great wealth 

and fine children should resurrection come ? 
19:78 Has he looked into the realm of the unseen? 

Or has he taken with the All-Merciful 

a binding covenant? 
19:79 No, indeed, he has not ! 

We shall write down what he says. 

And We shall extend for him 

the duration of the torment, exceedingly. 
19:80 For We shall inherit from him 

all that whereof he speaks. 

And he shall come to Us bereft and alone. 

i9:8i Now, they have taken false gods

apart from the only true God, 

so that they may be for them 

a means to power. 
19:82 No, indeed, they are not! 

On the Day of Judgment , 

these false gods shall belie 

their very worship of them . 

For there they shall be 

inveterate opponents to them. 
19:83 Have you not seen, O Prophet, 

that We have sent the satans 

against the disbelievers 

to instigate evil among them 

with such vehement instigation? 
19:84 Thus make no haste 

as to seeking God's judgment against them. 

We but number for them 

a determined number of days and deeds — 
19:85 until the Day Hereafter 

when We assemble the God-fearing 

before the All-Merciful in honored delegations, 
19:86 and We drive the defiant unbelievers to Hell 

in disgraced droves. 
19:87 None holds the right of intercession 

but those believers 

who have taken with the All-Merciful 
a special covenant for this . 

19:88 Moreover, they who disbelieve have said: 

The All-Merciful has taken to Himself a son. 

19:89 Very truly, you who say this 

have come forth with something abominable! 

19:90 From it the heavens nearly burst, 
and the earth almost splits, 
and the mountains all but fall down, 



522

SURAH 1 9 I MARYAM - MARY 



in sudden collapse — 
i9:9i that they should ascribe to the All-Merciful 
a son — 

19:92 while never would it be befitting 

to the All-Merciful that He take a son! 
19:93 Indeed, every being in the heavens and the earth 

but comes to the All-Merciful as a servant. 
19:94 Very truly, He has enumerated each of them. 

And He has numbered every one of them 

with a precise number. 
19:95 Thus each one of them is coming to Him 

on the Day of Resurrection all alone. 
19:96 As for those who believe 

and do righteous deeds, 

it is for them that the All-Merciful 

shall ordain in their hearts 

genuine mutual love. 

19:97 Therefore, We have, indeed, 
revealed this Quran to you, 
and made it easy to understand 
in your native tongue, O Prophet, 
for you to give with it 

glad tidings of Paradise to the God-fearing, 
and to forewarn therewith a contentious people 
of God's nearing Judgment . 
19:98 For how many a disbelieving generation 

before them have We destroyed, O Prophet ? 
Do you perceive even one of them, 
or hear from them a single sound?

20:10 Behold! 

He saw a fire 

on the side of Mount Tur of Sinai . 

So he said to his family: Remain here. 

Indeed, I have noticed a fire. 

Perhaps from it, I shall bring you a firebrand; 

or I shall find at the fire

20:ii So when he came to it, 

he was called: O Moses! 
20:12 Indeed, I am! I am your Lord! 

So take off your sandals. 

You are in the Holy Valley of Tuwa. 
20:13 For I have chosen you as a messenger . 

Therefore, listen to what is being revealed: 
20:14 Indeed, it is I! I am God! 

There is no God but Me. 

So worship Me alone . 

And duly establish the Prayer

20:15 Indeed, the Hour of Doom is coming. 

I have designed to keep it hidden, 

so that every soul may be duly recompensed

20:16 So let not whoever disbelieves in the Hour

turn you away from preparing for it, 

so that you fall into doom. 
20:17 And what is that in your right hand, O Moses? 
20:18 He said: It is my staff. 

I lean upon it. 

And with it I beat down leaves for my sheep. 
And, therein, for me are other uses.

20:40 Behold! 

Your sister walked trailing you

She then said to Pharaoh's household : 

Shall I direct you to someone

So We returned you to your mother,

Moreover, you then killed a person. 

Yet, still, We delivered you

Thus have We tried you with great trials. 

Moreover, you have stayed for years

We are messengers of your Lord. 

So send forth with us the Children of Israel,

20:55 -Sif From it have We created you. 

And to it shall We return you. 

And from it shall We bring you forth

20:56 Thus very truly, 

We showed Pharaoh Our miraculous signs — 

all of them that had been given to Moses . 

But he belied them and resisted faith , 
20:57 and he said: 

Have you come to oust us from our land 

with your sorcery, O Moses? 
20:58 Then we shall most surely confront you 

with sorcery like it. 

So set between us and you an appointed time — 

which neither we nor you shall miss — 

in an open , level place. 
20:59 Moses said: 

Your appointed time is the Day of Festival, 

at mid-morning, while the people are assembled. 
20:60 So Pharaoh turned away 

and concocted his scheme. 

Then he came forth on that day 

with his sorcerers . 
20:61 And Moses said to them: Woe to you! 

Do not forge a lie against God! 

For He will raze you with some torment. 

Thus whoever forges such lies against Him 

has forever failed. 
20:62 Then the sorcerers quarreled 



529

between themselves about their affair, 

but kept their council secret. 
20:63 They said: 

Indeed, these are, most surely, two sorcerers 

who desire to oust you from your own land 

with their sorcery, 

and to do away with the ideal 

of your way of life . 
20:64 Therefore, come together 

to accomplish your scheme. 

Then come forth resolved in a united rank. 

For whoever prevails today has truly succeeded. 
20:65 They said: O Moses! 

Either you shall throw 

your staff to the ground first , 

or we shall be first to throw ours down . 
20:66 He said: Rather, you throw first ! 

And behold! 

Their ropes and staffs appeared to him, 

from their sorcery, to be slithering. 
20:67 Then Moses conceived a fear within himself. 
20:68 We said: Have no fear! 

Indeed, it is you who shall be the uppermost. 
20:69 Throw to the ground 

what is in your right hand. 

It shall then swallow up 

what they have wrought. 

For what they have wrought 

is but the scheme of a sorcerer — 

and never shall the sorcerer succeed, 

wherever he may go!

in astonishment , 

bowing their faces down

Have you believed impetuously because of him 

before I have permitted you to do so? 

Indeed, he is certainly your master-sorcerer, 

who has taught you sorcery! 

Therefore, I shall, indeed, 

cut off your hands and your feet 

on opposite sides! 

Moreover, I shall, most surely, crucify you 
on the trunks of date palms! 
Thus you shall certainly know 
as to me and the God of Moses 
which of us is severer in inflicting torment, 
and making pain more lasting. 
20:72 They said: 

We will never prefer submission to you 
over believing 

in the clear and miraculous proofs of God

nor over the One who originated us! 

So decree whatever punishment 

you will decree. 

You but decree in the life of this world. 
20:73 As for us, we have believed in our Lord, 

so that He may forgive us for our misdeeds, 

and for whatever sorcery 

you have forced upon us. 

For God is best in reward 

and everlasting in punishment . 
20:74 Indeed, whoever comes to his Lord

wherein one shall neither die

20:75 But whoever comes to Him as a believer, 

having done righteous deeds, 

then it is these for whom are the highest ranks: 
20:76 Gardens everlasting, beneath which rivers flow, 

wherein they shall abide forever and ever . 

For such is the reward 

of whoever purifies himself 

with repentance and godliness . 

20:77 Thus We revealed to Moses: 

Set out by night with My servants, 
the Children of Israel . 
Then strike for them a dry passage 
through the sea. 

Do not fear being overtaken by Pharaoh . 

Nor have any dread of drowning . 
20:78 So Pharaoh followed them with his forces, 

and they were overwhelmed by the sea — 

and what an awesome whelming it was ! 
20:79 Thus Pharaoh had led his people astray 

and did not guide them aright. 

20:80 God said: O Children of Israel! 

We have delivered you from your enemy; 

and We have promised you an appointed time, 

on the right side of Mount Tur 

to give you My commandments . 

Moreover, We have sent down manna and quail 

to sustain you in the desert, saying : 
20:81 Eat of the wholesome foods 

which We have provided for you. 

But do not transgress therein. 

For then My wrath shall befall you.

when he arrived at Mount Tur : 

What has made you hasten 

from your people, O Moses? 
20:84 He said: 

They are close upon my footsteps. 

And I have hastened to You, my Lord, 

that You may be pleased. 
20:85 He said: Then know : 

We have already tried your people 

after you departed , 

and the Samiriy has led them astray. 
20:86 So Moses returned to his people 

wrathful and sorrowful. 

He said: O my people! 

Did your Lord not promise you 

an excellent promise? 

Was the duration of my absence 

too long for you? 

Or did you desire 

for the great wrath of your Lord to befall you, 
such that you failed your promise to me 
to worship God alone ? 
20:87 They said: 

We did not fail your promise 

of our own accord. 

Rather, we were loaded with burdens 

from the golden ornaments 

of the Egyptian people.

So we hurled them into a furnace of fire — 

and thus did the Sammy cast into it

20:88 Then he brought forth for them 
the image of a Golden Calf — 

a mere spiritless body that with the wind 

made the sound of a low. 

And they said to each other : 

This is your god and the god of Moses. 

Yet he has forgotten it . 
20:89 Could they not, then, see 

that it could not return a single word to them. 

Nor did it hold for them 

any power of harm or benefit? 
20:90 And truly Aaron had told them 

before Moses' return : O my people! 

You are only being tried by God 

through this idol . 

For, indeed, your Lord 

is none but the All-Merciful. 

Thus shall you follow me 
in worshipping God alone 

and obey my command in this ! 
20:9i They said: 

Never shall we give up 

our devotion to it until Moses returns to us. 
20:92 Moses seized his brother and said: O Aaron! 

What prevented you 

when you saw them going astray 
20:93 from following after me? 

Did you dare disobey my command! 
20:94 He said: O son of my mother! 

Seize me not by my beard nor by my head! 

I feared that you would say:

among the Children of Israel, 

and you did not observe my word. 
20:95 Moses said: 

What then were you seeking to do, O Samiriy? 
20:96 He said: 

I perceived what they did not perceive. 

So I grasped a handful of dust 

from the trace of the messenger, 

and I cast it into the molten gold — 

and thus did my soul tempt me! 
20:97 He said: Begone, then! 

For it is for you, in this life, to say: 

Untouchable! 

And, indeed, for you 

there is an appointed time of punishment 
in the Hereafter that you shall never miss! 
Moreover, look to your god, O Samiriy , 
to which you remained devout! 
Most surely, we shall burn it. 
Then, most surely, shall we pulverize 
and scatter it in the sea — scatter it utterly. 
20:98 Indeed, your God, O Israel, is the only God — 
the One besides whom there is no other god. 
He has encompassed all things in knowledge. 

20:99 So it is that We relate to you, O Prophet, 

something of the tidings that have gone before. 
For, truly, We have given you — 
solely from Us — 

a revealed Reminder of the way of God . . 
20:100 Whoever turns away from it,

leaves of the garden. 

For Adam had disobeyed his Lord. 

Thus he erred. 
20:122 Then his Lord chose him as a Prophet , 

and absolved him of his sin , and guided him. 
20:123 God said: 

Descend from the garden , 

both of you, together, along with Satan — 

each of you an enemy to the other. 

But if there comes to you, O humanity, 

guidance from Me, 

then whoever follows My guidance 

shall not go astray in the world 

and shall not suffer misery in the Hereafter . 
20:124 But whoever turns away 

from My remembrance, for him, indeed,

there shall be a stringent life. 

And We shall bring him to assembly, 

on the Day of Resurrection, blind. 
20:125 He shall say: My Lord! 

Why have You brought me 

to assembly blind, though I used to see? 
20:126 He shall say: So it is! 

Our signs came to you. Yet you forgot them. 

And so this Day you are forgotten. 
20:127 Even so do We recompense 

whoever is exceedingly rebellious 

and has not believed 

in the revealed signs of his Lord. 

And, indeed, the torment of the Hereafter 

is severer still and more lasting. 
20:128 Have the many generations before them 

that We have destroyed — 

in whose very dwellings they now walk — 

not become a clear guiding sign for them? 

Indeed, in this there are sure signs 

for people of discernment. 
20:129 Yet were it not for a preordained word 

that had preceded from your Lord, O Prophet, 

to defer judgment upon people, 

their immediate destruction 

would have been inescapable — 

but for the fulfillment of a stated term of life . 
20:130 So be patient, O Prophet, 

with what they say. 

And highly exalt your Lord with all praise 
before the rising of the sun and before its setting. 
And in the watches of the night 
exalt Him , as well, and at the ends of the day — 
so that you may become well-pleased. 
20:i3i Thus you shall not extend

the gaze of your eyes toward the unbelievers 
and what We have given 
any number of them to enjoy: 
The mere fl ower of the life of this world, 
by which We put them to test. 
For, indeed, the blessed provision of your Lord 
is far better and everlasting. 
20:132 Moreover, 

enjoin the Prayer upon your family, 
O Prophet, and persevere patiently with it. 
We do not ask of you any provision. 
Rather, it is We who provide for you. 
For the ultimate outcome 
is success for the God-fearing alone . 

20:133 Yet they who disbelieve 

have said of you, O Prophet : 

If only he were to bring us a sign from his Lord! 

Yet has clear proof not, then, 

come to them in this Quran 

as to what was in the earlier Scriptures? 
20:134 Now had it been that We destroyed them 

with some torment 

before sending them this Quran, 

most surely, they would have said: Our Lord! 

If only You had sent to us a messenger, 

then we would have followed 

Your revealed signs 

before we became humiliated and disgraced! 
20:135 Say to them : 

All of us are in wait of the ultimate outcome . 
So wait for the Judgment of God ! 
You shall, assuredly, come to know 
who are the companions of the even way 
of faith and who is thus guided aright.

Drawing near to the people is their reckoning! 
Yet in heedlessness they turn away 

from this Heavenly message . 

Not a new reminder from the Quran 

comes to them from their Lord, 

but that they listen to it 

as they make jesting sport of it , 

their hearts diverted by whims . 

Rather, those who do wrong 

would keep secret their conversations: 

Is this Muhammad other than a human being 

like yourselves? 

Do you then yield to sorcery, 

even as you see that he is merely human? 

God Himself revealed their conversation 

to the Messenger, who then said to them : 

My Lord knows all that is said 

in the heaven and the earth. 

For He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. 

Still they have said: 

This Quran is a muddle of dreams! 
Rather, he has forged it! Rather, he is a poet!

like that with which 
the former prophets were sent. 
Not one city before them 
which We have destroyed 
believed in the miraculous signs ! 
Will they, then, believe them ? 
Moreover, We have not sent any messengers 
to the generations before you, O Prophet, 
but mere mortal men, 
to whom We gave revelation. 
So if you who disbelieve do not know this , 
then ask the People of the revealed Reminder, 
who know the Heavenly Scriptures . 
Neither did We create them 
as mere bodies without spirits 
that did not eat food. Nor were they immortals. 
Yet, We duly fulfilled the divine promise 
to help them. 
Thus We delivered them, 
along with whomever We so willed 
who upheld them . 

But We destroyed all those who belied them 
and were thus exceedingly rebellious. 
2i:io Truly, We have sent down to you, 

O people of Muhammad, 
a Heavenly Book that bears in it 
your glory and eminent remembrance 

for all time . 

Will you not, then, understand? 
21:11 For, how many a city 

whose inhabitants were doing wrong 

in unbelief did We utterly shatter before you 

and raise up after them 

another people in their place ?

But it was said to them: 
2i:i3 Do not flee, but return to the luxuries 

in which you once indulged 

and to your lofty dwellings, 

so that you may be questioned now 

about the destiny of wrongdoing . 
2i:i4 They but said: Oh, woe to us! 

Indeed, we have been godless wrongdoers! 
2i:i5 And never did this confessional cry of theirs 

cease upon their lips , 

until We had turned them into mere stubble; 

and they had been utterly extinguished. 
2i:i6 For We have not created the heavens 

and the earth and whatever is between them 

for mere sport. 
2i:i7 Had We intended to take up any amusement, 

We would most surely have taken it 

from the higher realm that is with Us 

and not from the world — 

if ever We were to do so. 
2i:i8 On the contrary, 

We but hurl the truth against falsehood, 

and it utterly smashes it — 

thus at once it vanishes! 

So the all-punishing woe of Hellfire 

shall assuredly be yours 

for all that you falsely ascribe to God ! 
2i:i9 For to Him belongs 

all who are in the heavens and the earth. 

Moreover, those who are near Him 

are never disdainful of His worship, 

nor do they grow weary of it .

by night and by day — never pausing. 
21:21 Then as to those who disbelieve , 

have they truly taken gods 

from the earth who resurrect the dead ? 
21:22 Had there been — in either Heaven or earth — 

any gods other than God, 

both Heaven and earth would, most surely, 

have become corrupted by competing deities . 

So highly exalted is God, Lord of the Throne, 

far above all that they ascribe to Him ! 
21:23 He shall never be called to account 

for what He does. 

Yet they shall be questioned by Him 
about all they have done in life ! 
21:24 Then have they, indeed, taken gods 
apart from Him? 
Say to them, O Prophet : 
Bring forth your proof] 
This Quran is the revealed Reminder 
of God's way — 

proof for those who are with me. 
Moreover, there is the Reminder 
that has been revealed 
to each of those messengers 
who were before me, 

none of which confirm other gods with God . 
Rather, most of them who claim this 
do not know the truth, 
and thus they turn away from it 
when they hear it . 
2i:25 For We have not sent before you, 

O Prophet, any messenger 
but that We revealed to him 
that there is no God but Me. 
Thus you shall worship Me alone !

2i:26 Yet they who disbelieve have said: 
The All-Merciful 

has taken to Himself angels as offspring. 

Highly exalted is He above this ! 

Rather, they are but honored servants of God ! 
21:27 They do not precede Him in speech. 

Rather, they do everything 

only by His command. 
2i:28 He alone knows 

what lies before them 

and what lies behind them. 

Nor do they intercede with God — 

except on behalf 

of those with whom He is pleased. 
For out of fear of Him, they are cautious. 
2i:29 vfrAnd if ever one of them should say: 
I am a god apart from Him! — 
then such a one 

would We recompense with Hell. 
For thus it is 

that We recompense the wrongdoers 
who are godless in heart . 

2i:30 Have those who disbelieve 

not seen by the knowledge they acquire 

that the heavens and the earth 

were conjoined as one mass, 

then We separated them — 

and that We have made 

every living thing therein from water? 

Will they not, then, believe in God's Oneness ? 
2i:3i So too have We set in the Earth 

anchoring mountains, so that it does not sway 

with them upon it as it spins . 

And We made therein broad pathways, 




545 



SURAH 2 1 I AL-ANBIYA' - THE PROPHETS

so that they might find guidance therein . 
21:32 And We made the heaven a vault, 
safeguarded above the earth . 
Still they turn away 

from pondering the wonders of its signs. 
2i:33 For He is the One 

who created the night and the daylight, 
and the sun and the moon — 
each, within a course, is swimming on 
through the spheres as preordained . 

2i:34 Furthermore, We have not given immortality 
to any human being who preceded you, 
O Prophet . 

Yet if you die, as the disbelievers hope, 
will they, then, be immortals? 
2i:35 Every single soul shall taste death. 
For We but test you in life 
with evil and good as a trial. 
And it is to Us 

you shall all be returned for recompense . 
2i:36 Thus when those who disbelieve see you, 
they but take you as an object of mockery, 
saying : 
Is this the one 

who mentions your gods profanely ? — 
though at the mention of the All-Merciful 
they themselves profess unbelief in Him ! 

2i:37 Man is a creature of haste. 

Soon shall I show you My signs of judgment 

fulfilled against the disbelievers . 

So do not call for Me to hasten this . 

2i:38 Yet they say in contempt : 
When will this promise

21:39 Never would this be asked 

if only those who disbelieve knew 

that a time will come 

when they will not be able to hold off 

the Fire of Hell from their faces 

nor from their backs — 

and therein they shall never be helped! 
2i:40 Indeed, it shall all come upon them, suddenly, 

and confound them utterly . 

It is then that they will not be able to repel it. 

Nor shall they be reprieved. 
2i:4i And very truly, messengers before you 

were mocked, O Muhammad . 

But those who scoffed at them 

were encompassed 

by the very punishment they used to mock. 
2i:42 Say to the unbelievers : 

Who is it that shall guard you 

by night and by daylight 

from the Judgment of the All-Merciful? 

Rather, it is from the very Remembrance 

of their Lord that they turn away. 
2i:43 Then do they, indeed, have gods 

that shield them from affliction apart from Us? 

They call gods 

those who cannot even help themselves. 
Thus never shall they be afforded security 
against Us! 

2i:44 Indeed, We have given these disbelievers 
and their forefathers 
much comfort and enjoyment — 
until the life spans of heedlessness 
that stretched over them grew long. 
Do they not see that We come

and diminish unbelief in it from its outskirts? 

Are they, then, the triumphant ones? 
2i:45 Say to them : 

Indeed, I only forewarn you 

with God's Revelation of a nearing Judgment . 

But the deaf of heart hear no call 

when they are forewarned 
to cease their works of unbelief ! 
2i:46 Yet if even a mere breath 

of your Lord's torment were to touch them, 

they would most surely say: Oh, woe to us! 

Indeed, we have been godless wrongdoers! 
2i:47 Moreover, it is We alone 

who set up the just balances 

for the Day of Resurrection, 

so that no soul shall be wronged in anything. 

And even if one's deed is the mere weight 

of a single mustard seed, We shall bring it forth. 

Thus sufficient are We 

as the very best of reckoners. 

2i:48 Now, very truly, it is We alone 

who gave Moses and Aaron 

the Torah, as a Criterion of truth , 

and as a radiant light to guidance , 

and as a revealed Reminder 

for the God-fearing ones — 
2i:49 those who fear their Lord 

while He is in the domain of the unseen, 

and who are ever-cautious 

of the Hour of Doom .

For We well knew the worthiness of him. 
21:52 Behold! 

He said to his own father and his people: 

What are these statues 

to which you are devoted? 
2i:53 They said: 

We found our forefathers worshipping them! 
2i:54 He said: 

Very truly, all of you — 

you and your forefathers — 

have been utterly lost in clear misguidance. 
2i:55 They said: 

Have you come to us with the word of truth, 

or are you of those 

who are merely jesting and playing? 
2156 He said: No, indeed! 

Your Lord is the Lord 

of the heavens and the earth, 

the One who alone originated them. 

And to this, I am one of those 

who bear witness. 
2i:57 Thus he said to himself: By God! 

I shall, most surely, plot against your idols 

after you go away, 

when you have turned your backs to them .

Surah 



/ 78 VERSES / REVEALED AT MADINAH 




IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE ALL-MERCIFUL, THE MERCY-GIVING 



22:1 O humankind! 

Be ever God-fearing, conscious of your Lord. 

For the quaking of the earth 

at the Hour of Doom 

is a terrible thing, indeed. 
22:2 The Day you see it, every nursing female 

will become utterly diverted 

from what she is nursing. 

And every pregnant female 

shall at once deliver her burden out of terror . 

And you will see people as if they are drunken, 

though they are not drunken, 

but rather the torment from God 

is so very severe. 

22:3 Yet among humankind, 

there is the type of person 

who argues about God 

without any revealed knowledge 

and who, therefore, follows 

every rebellious satan — 
22:4 those followers of the evil one,

it has, indeed, been decreed by God 

that whoever takes him as a patron, 

he shall, indeed, lead him astray in this life . 

Moreover, he shall guide him 

to the torment of the Flaming Fire of Hell . 

O humankind! 

If you are in doubt about the Ultimate Rising 

on the Day of Resurrection , 
then know that, indeed, 
We created all of you originally from dust, 
then from a sperm-drop, 
then from a clinging clot, 
then from a morsel-like lump — 

destined to be either fully formed 
or left unformed. 

In this way, do We make clear to you 
God's all-creative might . 
Thus do We cause to settle 
in the wombs of their mothers 
whatever unborns We so will, for a stated term. 
Then We bring you forth as children, 
so that you may thereafter reach full maturity. 
Then among you are those who die young . 
And some of you are reduced by old age 
to the most abject state of life; 
such that one, 

after having had some knowledge, 
will not know anything. 
And even so do you see the earth lifeless. 
But when We send down upon it water, 
it quivers and swells 

and grows every delightful variety of plant life . 

That is so because God 

is, most surely, the Eternal Truth. 

For it is He alone who gives life to the dead.

And it is He alone 

who is powerful over all things. 

Thus the Hour of Doom 

is most surely coming. 

There is no doubt therein. 

And God shall raise 

all those who are in the graves 

to the Reckoning . 



Yet among humankind 
there is the type of person 
who argues about God 
without any revealed knowledge, 
nor any divine guidance, 
nor an illuminating Heavenly Book. 
He turns himself aside from the truth 
in disdain, in order to lead people astray 
from the path of God. 

There shall be for him disgrace in this world. 
Then We shall make him taste, 
on the Day of Resurrection, 
the torment of burning in Hellfire. 
22:io It shall be said to him: 

That is the recompense for all the evil 
that your two hands have advanced 
in the world — 

and never does God wrong His servants 
in the least . 



22:11 Moreover, among humankind, 
there is the type of person 
who worships God as if he is teetering 
on the outermost edge of faith . 
Thus if good befalls him, he is at peace with it. 
But if a trial befalls him,

he turns about-face back into unbelief. 
Thus, he loses the good of this world 
and the bliss of the Hereafter. 
Such is the most manifest loss! 
22:12 He calls upon idols in his worship , 
apart from God, 

which can neither harm him nor benefit him. 
Such is, indeed, 

the uttermost point of misguidance. 
22:13 He calls out to those whose harm 

is surer than their benefit. 

A most woeful alliance it is, indeed, 

and a most woeful fellowship! 
22:14 For, indeed, 

God shall admit those who believe 

and do righteous deeds 

into Gardens beneath which rivers flow. 

Indeed, God does whatever He so intends. 

22:15 Whoever thinks God 

shall never aid His Messenger 

and make him triumphant — 

in this world and in the Hereafter — 

let him stretch a rope into the sky and climb it . 

Then let him cut it off and fall to his death — 

to see if, perhaps, his scheme will at last 

do away with what has so enraged him ! 

22:16 And so it is that with lucid examples 

We have sent down the Quran's clear verses. 
For, indeed, God guides with it 
whomever He so wills. 

22:17 So as to those who believe in Islam ,

none can give him honor. 

Indeed, God does whatever He so wills. || 
22:19 Behold the believers and the unbelievers :

contend with one another

Thus those who disbelieve 

shall have raiments of fire

Thus have We subjugated 
the sacrificial animals to feed you all ,

22:37 Never shall any part of their flesh

But rather, it is your devotion —

Our Lord is God alone ! 
For had God not decreed 
to repel some people by means of others, 
demolition would certainly have come 
to many hermitages, and churches, 
and synagogues, and mosques, 
in which the name of God 
is much mentioned in praise . 
Yet, most surely, God shall support 
whoever supports faith in Him. 
Indeed, God is, most surely, all-powerful, 
overpowering. 
22:41 These are the ones who — 

when We set them in authority 

over the land — 

they duly establish the Prayer, 

and give the Zakat-Charity, 

and enjoin what is right 

and forbid what is wrong. 

Yet to God alone 

belongs the ultimate end of all affairs. 
22:42 Thus if they who disbelieve 

belie you, O Prophet, so too before them 

did the people of Noah and the tribes of c Ad 

and Thamud belie their prophets — 
22:43 and the people of Abraham 

and the people of Lot did likewise ; 
22:44 and so did the inhabitants of Midian. 

Moreover, Moses, too, was belied. 

Yet I granted respite 

to the disbelievers for a time . 

But, thereafter, I seized them, suddenly. 

How awesome , then, 

was My denunciation of them all ! 
22:45 Then how many a city before,

whose inhabitants belied their messengers, 

have We devastated while it was doing wrong? 

Thus are they yet desolate 

and toppled upon their roofs. 

And how many an unattended well 

and lofty palace are forsaken there ? 
22:46 So have they who deny faith 

not journeyed through the lands 

and seen enough of such ends, 

so as to have their hearts awakened 

to understand with them, 

and their ears opened 

so that they may truly hear with them ? 

For it is not the eyes that become blind 

but the hearts within the breasts that go blind. 
22:47 Thus only in defiance do they ask you, 

O Prophet/ 

to hasten the promised punishment 

of which you have forewarned them . 

And never shall God fail to fulfill His promise! 

Yet, indeed, a day with your Lord 

is like a thousand years 

of what you count on earth . 
22:48 Thus how many a city 

did I respite, while it was doing wrong? 

Then I seized it in the midst of its unbelief . 

For to Me alone is the ultimate destiny. 
22:49 O Prophet, say: O humanity! 

Indeed, I am but a clear forewarner 

of God's nearing Judgment sent to all of you.

is much forgiveness for their sins

hoping ardently to guide people, 
Satan cast evil whisperings

22:56 All the dominion on that Day 

wherein is the Hour of Judgment 

belongs to God alone. 

He will judge between them all . 

So those who believe 

and do righteous deeds in life 

shall in the Hereafter be resident 

in the perpetual Gardens of Delight. 
22:57 But those who have disbelieved 

and belied Our natural and revealed signs, 

then such as these are the ones 

for whom there is a disgracing torment 

awaiting in the Hereafter . 
22:58 As to those who have emigrated 

in the path of God, then are killed or die, 

most surely, God will provide them 

with a most excellent provision

For, indeed, God alone is the best of providers. 
22:59 Most surely, He shall admit them into Paradise

is, most surely, all-knowing, most forbearing.

Rather, if a fly were to rob them 
of even a mere speck of anything, 
never could they even retrieve it from it. 
Most feeble are the seeker and the sought! 
22:74 Thus, they have not esteemed God 
with His rightful esteem. 
Indeed, God alone

Moreover, do much good in life , 

so that you may succeed.^ 
22:78 Thus strive, O believers, for the sake of God 
to uphold His commandments — 

with the kind of striving 

that is thoroughly worthy of Him. 

For it is He alone 

who has chosen you for this faith — 

nor has He placed on you any undue strain 

in your religion. 

It is the sacred way of your forefather Abraham. 
And it is He alone who has in honor 
named you Muslims in the Scriptures of old — 
and in this Quran — 

so that Muhammad, the Messenger of God, 

may be a witness to God's truth 

before all of you, 

and that you may, in turn, 

be witnesses to the revealed truth 

before all people. 

So duly establish the Prayer

23:2i Moreover, in cattle of every kind 

there is, indeed, a sure lesson for you. 

We give you to drink of the milk 

that is within their bellies. 

And in them, there are 

many other benefits for you. 

And from them, there is meat that you eat. 
23:22 And upon them, and upon ships, 

you are carried through land and sea . 

23:23 Now, very truly, 

We sent Noah as a messenger to his people. 
So he said to them : O my people! 
Worship God alone . 

You do not have any God other than Him. 
Will you not, then, be God-fearing? 
23:24 Yet the elders of his people, 
who disbelieved, said: 

This man is but a mere mortal like yourselves! 
He desires to have superiority over you. 
Now, had God truly willed 

to reveal a message to us , 

He would have sent down angels 

as messengers . 

We have not heard of this claim 
occurring in the time of our forefathers of old. 
23:25 He is nothing but a man 
touched with madness.

23:33 But the elders of his people —

for Judgment in the Hereafter, 

though We had given them luxuries

who has forged a lie against God,

utterly remorseful. 
23:4i So the deadly blast of Our punishment 

seized them, suddenly, with inevitable justice. 
Thus We turned them into floating debris. 
So away with the wrongdoing people! 

23:42 Then after them We raised other generations. 
23:43 No nation can hasten its set term of judgment 

Nor can they remain thereafter. 
23:44 Then We sent Our messengers to them , 

one after the other. 

Whenever a messenger came to a people, 
they belied him. 

Thus We caused them to follow one another 
into destruction . 

And We turned every one of them 
into a byword of reproach 
among the succeeding nations . 
So away with a people who do not believe! 

23:45 Thereafter, We sent Moses 

and his brother, Aaron, 

with Our miraculous signs 

and manifest authority, 
23:46 to Pharaoh and his assembly of nobles. 

But they grew so very arrogant,

24:1 This is a surah of the Quran . 

We have sent it down as Heavenly revelation 

and ordained the obligations herein. 

And thus , We have sent down herewith 

verses of clear intent , 

so that you may become mindful 
of God's commandments : 
24:2 As to she who fornicates and he who fornicates, 

whip each one of them a hundred lashes — 

and let no pity for them overtake you 

in adhering to God's religion, 

if truly you believe in God 

and in the coming Judgment of the Last Day. 

Moreover, let a group of the believers 

witness their punishment. 
24:3 A man who fornicates shall not marry anyone 

but a woman who fornicates or an idolatress. 

And as for the woman who fornicates, 

none shall marry her 

but a fornicator or an idolater — 

and such marriage is forbidden 

for the believers. 
24:4 As to those who accuse chaste women

SURAH 24 1 AL-NUR - THE LIGHT 



of illicit sexual intercourse 
who then do not produce four eyewitnesses 

to the very act , whip them eighty lashes 
and do not accept 

any testimony from them ever after, 
for it is these who are the ungodly — 
24:5 except for those of them 

who repent after this offense 
and set things aright. 

For, indeed, God is all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 
24:6 As to those who accuse their wives of adultery 

while having no eyewitnesses but themselves, 

then the due testimony of each accuser 

is to bear witness four times, swearing by God, 

that he is, indeed, of the truthful — 
24:7 while the fifth testimony shall be 

that the curse of God be upon him 

if he is of the liars. 
24:8 Yet punishment shall be averted from her 

if she bears witness four times, 
swearing by God, 

that he is, indeed, of the liars — 
24:9 while the fifth testimony shall be 

that the wrath of God be upon her 

if he is of the truthful. 

24:io Now, what would become of you, O believers, 
were it not for the grace of God upon you, 
and His mercy, 
and were it not that God 
is, indeed, all-relenting, all-wise! 

24:ii Indeed, those who have come to you 
with the wicked slander 
against the mother of the believers 
are a band of hypocrites among you. 
Do not consider it evil for you.

Each one of them shall be charged

in the Hereafter . 
24:12 If only when you first heard it uttered ,

four witnesses to attest to it!

there shall be for them a most painful torment

merely enjoins obscenity

God is all-forgiving of such handmaidens, 
and mercy-giving toward them . 

24:34 Thus very truly, O humankind, 

We have sent down to you in this Quran 
verses that clarify God's truth 
and give examples that elucidate 
the exemplary ways of those righteous ones 
who have passed away before you, 
along with specific admonitions 
of good conduct 

for the benefit of the God-fearing. 

24:35 -S^God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. 
The likeness of His light 
is as a niche wherein is a lamp, 
the lamp in a glass, 
the glass as if it were a brilliant star, 
kindled from a blessed tree, 
an olive — neither eastern nor western — 
whose oil would nearly shine out 
even if no fire touches it. 
Light upon light! 

God guides to His light whomever He so wills. 

And God sets forth parables for all people. 

For God alone is all-knowing of all things. 
24:36 Such light shines within houses of worship 

that God has decreed to be raised up 

and for His name 

to be ever remembered in them. 

Giving due exaltation to Him therein — 

in the early mornings and late afternoons — 
24:37 there are men 

whom neither commerce nor selling divert 

from the remembrance of God, 

or from the establishment of the Prayer, 




597 



SURAH 24 ! AL-NUR - THE LIGHT

or the giving of the Zakat-Charity. 

They fear a Day Hereafter 

when hearts and eyes shall roll frantically 

between salvation and damnation — 
24:38 in hope that God may reward them 

with the best they have ever done; 

and that He may increase 

them from His bounty. 

For God alone gives provision 

to whomever He so wills without measure. 
24:39 But here is the parable 

for those who have disbelieved in God : 

Their works are like a mirage in a leveled plain. 

The thirsting man thinks it is water, 

until when he approaches it 

he finds that it is nothing. 

Instead, in the Hereafter, 

he shall find only God there. 

Then He will render him 

his wicked account in full. 

For God is swift in reckoning. 
24:40 Or they are like one lost 

in veils of darkness in a fathomless sea 

covered by waves, above which are waves, 

above which are thick clouds — 

veils of darkness, one above the other. 

If one puts his hand out, he can barely see it. 

For one to whom God does not provide light 

has no light at all. 
24:4i Do you not see 

that whoever is in the heavens and the earth 

exalts God — as do the birds 

outspreading their wings in flight ? 

Each one of them among God's creation 

has known its way of prayer and exaltation. 

And God alone is all-knowing 



598 



part eighteen 



SURAH 24 I AL-NUR - THE LIGHT 



of all the acts that they do. 
24:42 For to God alone belongs the dominion 

over the heavens and the earth. 

And to God alone is the ultimate destiny. 
24:43 Have you not seen 

that God drives the clouds on, 

then joins them together, 

then piles them up in heaps , 

then you see rainfall issuing from their midst? 

Moreover, He sends down from the heaven 

mountainous clouds in which there is hail. 

Then He strikes with it whomever He so wills 

and turns it away from whomever He so wills. 

The flash of its lightning 

nearly takes away the sight. 
24:44 God alone alternates the night and the daylight. 

Indeed, in this, there is a sure lesson 

for those who have eyes to see! 
24:45 Moreover, God created every treading beast 

from water. 

Yet of them are those that go on their bellies. 
And of them are those that walk on two legs. 
And of them are those that walk on four. 
God creates whatever He so wills. 
Indeed, God is powerful over all things. 
24:46 Thus very truly, We have sent down verses 
clarifying God's truth . 

Yet God alone guides whomever He so wills 
to a straight way of salvation . 

24:47 Now, they who are hypocrites say: 

We believe in God and in the Messenger, 
and we obey them . 
Then a group of them turns away 
after this in defiance . 

Thus the likes of these are not true believers.

24:48 For when they are called to God 
and His Messenger 

to judge between them in their disputes , 
without delay 

a party of them turn themselves aside 

to avoid judgment against themselves . 
24:49 But if the truth is decisively in their favor, 

they come to him in full submission. 
24:50 Is there sickness in their hearts? 

Or is it, rather, 

that they doubt the word of faith , 
and, therefore, fear that God and His Messenger 
will be unjust to them? 
Rather, it is these who are the wrongdoers, 
godless in heart . 
24:5i Indeed, the only word of the true believers 

when they are called to God and His Messenger 
to judge between them is but to say: 
We hear and we obey! 

Thus it is these who are the truly successful. 
24:52 For whoever obeys God and His Messenger — 

and venerates God and fears Him — 

then such as these are the truly triumphant. 
24:53 -sic Yet they who are hypocrites swore by God, 

with the utmost of their vows, 

that if ever, O Prophet, 

you were to command them, 

they would go forth in God's cause . 

Say to them : Do not swear! 

Your false swearing of obedience is known! 

Indeed, God is all-aware 

of all the works that you do. 
24:54 Say to them : You shall obey God. 

And you shall obey the Messenger. 

Yet if you turn away, 

then know that he is answerable 




600

SURAH 24 I AL-NUR - THE LIGHT 



only for what he is charged to bear; 

and you are answerable 

for what you are charged to bear. 

But if you obey him, you will be rightly guided. 

Yet nothing is incumbent upon the Messenger 

except the clear conveyance of God's message . 
24:55 God has promised those of you who believe 

and do righteous deeds that He will, most surely, 

make them sovereign successors in the earth, 

just as He has made 

the like of those before them 

successors therein . 

Moreover, He will, most surely, 

establish for them their religion, 

which He has chosen for them. 

Furthermore, He will, most surely, 

give them in exchange, 

after their fear, great security — 

so long as they worship Me alone , 

not associating anything as a god with Me. 

Yet whoever disbelieves 

after this solemn promise , 

then it is these who are the ungodly. 
24:56 Thus duly establish the Prayer, 

and give the Zakat-Charity, 

and obey the Messenger, 

so that you may be granted mercy. 
24:57 Never think that those who disbelieve 

can elude the mighty Hand of God 

in even the furthest reaches of the earth. 

Moreover, their final abode 

shall be the Fire of Hell — 

and a most woeful destination it is! 

24:58 O you who believe! 

Let those whom your hands rightfully possess,

and those among you 

who have not reached puberty, 

seek your permission to attend to you 

at three times ot day : 

Before Dawn Prayer, 

and whenever you lay aside your garments 
at noontime, 

and after the Evening Prayer: 
These are three intervals of privacy for you. 
It is not an offense for you, nor for them, 
in times of day apart from this, 
that they go about attending you, 
or you, one another. 
And thus does God make clear to you 
the commandments in His revealed verses. 
For God is all-knowing, all- wise. 
24:59 Moreover, when the children among you 
reach puberty, 

let them seek permission to attend to you , 
as those before them have sought permission. 
And thus does God make clear to you 

the commandments in His revealed signs. 
For God is all-knowing, all-wise, 
24:60 As for women beyond child-bearing age 
who have no desire for marriage, 
it is not an offense for them 
if they lay aside their outer garments, 
without unduly exhibiting 
any of their adornment. 
Yet if they abstain from this 

out of modesty , it is best for them. 
And God is all-hearing, all-knowing 
24:6i There is no offense for the blind, 
nor is it an offense for the lame, 
nor is it an offense for the sick 

as to the commandments 




602

SURAH 24 I AL-NUR - THE LIGHT 



wherein they are unable . 
Nor is there any offense for yourselves, 
O believers, 

if you freely eat from your own homes, 

or the homes of your fathers, 

or the homes of your mothers, 

or the homes of your brothers, 

or the homes of your sisters, 

or the homes of your paternal uncles, 

or the homes of your paternal aunts, 

or the homes of your maternal uncles, 

or the homes of your maternal aunts, 

or the homes 

to which you properly hold the keys, 
or the homes of your friends. 
Nor is it an offense 
for you to eat together, or apart. 
Yet when you enter such homes, 
greet each other with peace — 
a greeting from the very providence of God, 
blessed and wholesome. 
Thus does God make the commandments 
of His revealed verses clear to you, 
so that you may understand and observe them. 
24:62 Furthermore, the true and constant believers 
are those who believe in God 
and His Messenger — 
and who, 

whenever they are together with the Prophet 
addressing a matter of common concern, 
do not part until they have taken his permission. 
O Prophet! ^ 

As to those who take your permission 
before parting with you , 
these are the ones who truly believe in God 
and His Messenger.

So when they ask your permission 
to attend to some of their own affairs, 
give permission to whomever of them you will. 
Moreover, seek God's forgiveness for them. 
Indeed, God is all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 
24:63 You believers shall not, however, 
render the manner 
of calling upon the Messenger 
among yourselves, 

like your own calling upon one another. 
Truly God knows those hypocrites among you 
who, sheltered by one another, 
stealthily slip away 
from the assembly of the Prophet 
without his permission . 
Then let those who go against 
His command or that of His Messenger 
beware! 

For a trial may well afflict them in this world . 
Or a most painful torment may afflict them 
in the Hereafter . 
24:64 Most assuredly, to God alone belongs 
all that is in the heavens and the earth. 
Truly, He knows every condition you are in. 
Thus on the Day they all return to Him 
for Judgment , 

He shall tell them then the due recompense 

of all that they have done in life . 

For God alone is all-knowing of all things.

IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE ALL-MERCIFUL, THE MERCY-GIVING 



25:1 Blessed be the One who has sent down 
upon His servant Muhammad 
the Quran as the Criterion, 
so that he might be a forewarner 
to all the worlds 

of the nearing Judgment of God — 
25:2 the One to whom belongs 

all dominion over the heavens and the earth; 
and who has never taken for Himself 
any offspring; 

and for whom there has never been 

any partner in all the dominion; 

and who alone has created everything 

and alone determined all of it 

with precise determination. 
253 Yet they who disbelieve have taken gods 

apart from Him that do not create anything, 

but who are themselves created. 

Nor do they hold — even for themselves — 
the power of harm or benefit. 

Nor do they hold power 

over death, or life, or resurrection. 
25:4 Moreover, those who have disbelieved

have said of this Quran : 
Indeed, this is but a fabrication that he 
who claims to be a messenger has forged, 
while other people have helped him with it! 
Thus, truly, they have come forth 
with a grave wrongdoing and falsehood. 
So too have they said of it : 
Tales of the ancients is all it is , 
which he has sought to write down. 
Thus they are dictated to him by another, 
early morning and late afternoon. 
Say, O Prophet : 

The One who alone knows every secret 
in the heavens and the earth 
has, most surely, sent it down 
as divine revelation . 

Indeed, ever is He all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 

And they have said, as well : 

What is with this messenger that he eats food 

and walks through the marketplaces? 

If only an angel were sent down to him 

to be a forewarner along with him! 

Or if only a treasure-trove 

were cast down to him! 

Or if only he were to have 

a miraculous garden from which he could eat! 

Furthermore, 

the godless wrongdoers have said of you, 

O Prophet : 

Indeed, you believers 

but follow a man bewitched! 

Look how they set forth 

malicious images for you, O Prophet ! 

Thus have they strayed so far from guidance 

that they cannot find a way back to God .

Are you the ones who led these,

25:18 They shall say: Highly exalted are You alone,

Never would it have been conceivable for us 
to make of ourselves patrons of anyone

You bestowed them and their forefathers

Those whom you worshipped in life 
have, indeed, belied you,

regarding their divinity . 
Now, you will not be able to turn away 
the Fire of Hell from yourselves , 
nor avail yourselves of any help against it . 

Thus any one of you human beings 
who in life persists in the grave wrong 
of worshipping others with God , 
We shall make him taste 
a great torment in the Hereafter .

Will you, then, be as a guardian over him

including cattle and many people.

We would, most surely, have sent forth

But it is you, henceforth,

25:65 And they are the ones who say: Our Lord! 

Turn aside from us the torment of Hell. 

Indeed, its torment is unrelenting. 
25:66 Assuredly, it is a most evil residence and station. 
25:67 And they are the ones who when they spend 

are neither excessive nor stingy, 

but who stand firm evenly between these. 
25:68 And they are the ones 

who do not call upon any other god with God. 

Nor do they kill a soul — 

which God has prohibited — except by right. 

Nor do they commit illicit sexual intercourse. 

For whoever does this 

shall meet the penalty of sin: 
25:69 Torment shall be multiplied 

on the Day of Resurrection for such a one. 

Thus he shall abide therein forever, disgraced — 
25:70 except for whoever repents, and believes, 

and does righteous deeds. 

For the likes of them, then, 

God will substitute their misdeeds 

with good deeds. 

And ever is God all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 
25:7i For whoever repents after sinning 

and works righteousness, then, indeed, 

such a person has repented to God 

with a worthy repentance. 
25:72 Thus the Servants of the All-Merciful, 

they are the ones who do not bear false witness. 

Moreover, when they pass by those 

uttering vile talk, they pass by honorably. 
25:73 And they are the ones who when reminded 

of the revealed verses of their Lord 

do not fall deaf and blind to them. 
25:74 And they are the ones who say: Our Lord!

Grant us in our spouses and our children 
the joy of our eyes. 

Moreover, make us an exemplar of goodness 

for the God-fearing. 
25:75 Such as these shall be rewarded 

with the High Chamber of Heaven , 

for what they endured patiently in life . 

And they shall be met therein 

with a welcoming salutation and peace. 
25:76 They shall abide therein forever — 

a most excellent residence and station. 
25:77 Say, O Prophet : 

Never would my Lord 
even care for you, O people, 

were it not for your calling upon Him 

in worship and need . 

But, truly, you disbelievers have belied faith . 

Thus your punishment 

shall soon become inescapable.

IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE ALL-MERCIFUL, THE MERCY-GIVING 



26:1 Td Sin Mini 

26:2 These are the revealed verses 

of the clear Book of God elucidating truth . 
26:3 Perhaps, O Prophet, 

you would consume yourself with sorrow 

because they who belie you 

will not become believers. 
26:4 If We so will, We shall send down upon them 

a sign from Heaven so miraculous 

that their necks shall remain ever bent 

in submission to it. 
26:5 Yet never does any Heavenly reminder 

from the All-Merciful, 

come to them anew in the Quran's verses , 

but they thoughtlessly turn away from it. 
26:6 Thus, truly, they have belied divine revelation . 

Therefore, the ill tidings 

of that Judgment 

which they have been mocking 

shall soon come to them. 
26:7 Have they not, then, looked to the earth:

26:8 Indeed, in all of this there is a sure sign 
of God's creative power . 

Still most of them are not believers! 
26:9 Thus it is your Lord, O Prophet, 

who is most surely, 

the Overpowering One , the Mercy- Giving. 

26:io Now, behold, O Prophet ! 

Your Lord called Moses, commanding him : 

You shall go to the wrongdoing people, 
26:ii the people of Pharaoh. 

Have they no fear of God ? 
26:12 He said: My Lord! 

Indeed, I fear that they will belie me. 
26:13 Thus would my breast narrow 

with apprehension, 

and my tongue falter in uttering Your words . 

So send, as well, for Aaron 

to accompany me as a messenger . 
26:14 Moreover, they have a charge 
established against me. 

So I fear they will kill me. 
26:15 God said: No, indeed! 

So go forth, both of you, 

with Our miraculous signs. 

Indeed, We are with you, 

listening to everything . 
26:16 Then go, both of you, to Pharaoh, and say: 

We are sent to you , each one, as a messenger 

of the Lord of AH the Worlds. 
26:17 So send forth with us the Children of Israel! 
26:18 Pharaoh said to Moses : 

Did we not raise you among us as a child? 

And did you not remain with us

for many years of your life thereafter ? 
26:19 Then you did the evil deed 

that you have done, killing one of us . 

And thus were you 
one of the ungrateful to me. 
26:20 Moses said: 

I did it then, when I was one of those astray. 
26:21 So I fled from you, when I feared you. 

Then my Lord granted me revealed wisdom 

and made me one of the messengers. 
26.22 Yet this blessing you claim 

to have conferred upon me as a child — 

was it not because you have enslaved 

the Children of Israel? 
26:23 Pharaoh said: 

And what is the Lord of All the Worlds? 
26:24 Moses said: 

He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, 

and all that is between them — 

if you are willing to be certain and have faith 
26:25 Pharaoh said to those around him: 

Do you not hear this? 
26:26 Moses said: 

He is your Lord 

and the Lord of your forefathers of old. 
26:27 Pharaoh said: 

Indeed, your messenger 

who has been sent to you, 

is, most surely, a madman! 
26:28 Moses said: 

He is the Lord of the East and the West, 

and all that is between them, 

if you would but use your reason 

to understand. 
26:29 Pharaoh said:

Most surely, 

if ever you take a god other than me, 
I shall certainly confine you in isolation, 
along with those now solitarily imprisoned. 

26:30 Moses said: 

Even if I were to bring you 
something clear as proof of what I say? 

26:3i Pharaoh said: 

Then bring it forth, 

if, indeed, you are one of the truthful 

messengers of God . 
26:32 So he threw his staff to the ground , 

and, behold, it was a manifest snake. 
26.33 And he drew forth his hand 

from the bosom of his garment , 

and, behold, 

it was radiant white without blemish 

to all the onlookers. 
26:34 Pharaoh said 

to the assembly of nobles around him: 

This is most surely a learned sorcerer! 
26:35 He desires only to oust all of you 

from your land with his sorcery. 

So what do you command concerning him ? 
26:36 They said: 

Delay him and his brother, 

and send forth ushers into the cities 
26:37 who shall bring you every well-learned sorcerer. 

26:38 So the sorcerers of Pharaoh were gathered 
for the appointed time at mid-morning , 
on a well-known Day of Festival . 

26:39 And it was said to the people: 
Are all of you gathered, 

26:40 so that we may follow in procession

if it is they who are triumphant? 
26:4i So when the sorcerers came, 

they said to Pharaoh: 

Is there to be a worthy reward for us 

if it is we who are triumphant? 
26:42 He said: Yes! 

Moreover, you shall, indeed, be of those 

who are brought near to me as an added honor . 
26:43 Moses said to them: 

Throw to the ground 

whatever sorcery you are to throw. 
26:44 So they threw down their ropes and staffs 

and said: 

By the invincible might of Pharaoh, 
it is we who shall, most surely, be triumphant! 
26:45 Then Moses threw his staff to the ground , 
and, behold, 

it swallowed up all that they had falsified 

with their sorcery . 
26:46 So the sorcerers 

fell to the ground, in astonishment , 

bowing their faces down 

in submission to God . 
26:47 They said: 

We believe in the Lord of All the Worlds, 
26:48 the Lord of Moses and Aaron! 
26:49 Pharaoh said: 

Have you believed impetuously 

because of him, 

before I have permitted you to do so? 
Indeed, he is certainly your master-sorcerer, 
who has taught you sorcery! 
Yet, most surely, you shall learn your lesson ! 
I shall, most surely, cut off

26:50 They said: No harm! 
Our faith is firm. 

Indeed, to our Lord we are returning. 
26:5i Indeed, we hope for our Lord 
to forgive us our misdeeds, 
for we have been the first of the believers 
among our people . 

26:52 ^Thereafter, We revealed to Moses: 

Set out by night with My servants, 

the Children of Israel . 

Indeed, you shall be pursued by Pharaoh . 
26:53 So Pharaoh sent ushers into the cities to say : 
26:54 Indeed, these aliens 

are but a very small minority. 
26:55 And, indeed, 

they have, most surely, enraged us. 
26:56 So we are all together to be on guard 

and ready to overtake them . 
26:57 Thus We drew them forth 

from gardens and springs, 
26:58 and treasure-houses, and a gracious station. 

26:59 SO it WaS. 

Yet We bequeathed it all 

to the Children of Israel. 
26:60 Thus they followed them at sunrise. 
26:6i Then when the two multitudes saw each other, 

Moses' companions said: 

Indeed, we are, most surely, doomed 

to be overtaken and killed by Pharaoh's hosts ! 
26:62 He said: No, indeed! 

Most surely, my Lord is with me.

Thus the sea split so that each part 

was like a great mountain. 
26:64 And, thereupon, We drew the others near. 
26:65 So We delivered Moses 

and those with him, all together. 
26:66 Then We drowned the others. 
26:67 Indeed, in this account there is a sure sign

nor were most of them believers! 
26:68 Thus it is your Lord, O Prophet, 

who is, most surely, 

the Overpowering One , the Mercy-Giving. 

26:69 Moreover, recite the tidings of Abraham 

to those of them who disbelieve . 
26:70 Behold! 

He said to his father and his people; 

What is it that you worship? 
26:7i They said: We worship idols! 

And to them we remain ever devoted. 
26:72 He said: 

Do they hear you when you call upon them ? 
26:73 Or do they benefit you or cause you harm? 
26:74 They said: 

No, but we found our forefathers 

doing the like of this. 
26:75 He said: 

Then do you see 

what you have been worshipping — 
26:76 you and your fathers of old? 
26:77 They are, indeed, an enemy to me. 
I worship none except

26:79 And He is the One who feeds me 

and gives me drink. 
26:80 And when I become ill, 

then He is the One who heals me. 
26:8i And He is the One who will cause me to die. 

Then He will bring me back to life 

in the Hereafter . 
26:82 And He is the One who I hope 

shall forgive me my misdeeds 

on the Day of Judgment. 
26:83 So he turned to God in prayer: My Lord! 

Grant me wise judgment, 

and unite me with the righteous in Paradise . 
26:84 Moreover, make for me reverent mention 

among the latter generations 

till the end of time . 
26:85 And make me of the inheritors 

of the Garden of Delight. 
26:86 And do forgive my father. 

Indeed, he has become of those who are astray. 
26:87 Thus do not disgrace me 

on the Day all are raised up for Judgment , 
26:88 a Day when mere wealth and children 

shall not benefit anyone in any way; 
26:89 but only those who come to God 

with a pure heart will be saved . 
26:90 Thus the Garden of Paradise 

shall be drawn near for the God-fearing,

26:198 Yet had We sent it down 

to one of the non- Arabic speaking — 
26:199 such that he could miraculously 

recite it to them —

26:200 And so it is 

that We have thrust this message 

into the hearts of the defiant unbelievers 

by way of your call, O Prophet, 

to make them accountable . 
26:201 They shall not believe in it until, at last, 

they see the painful torment! 
26:202 For it shall come to them, suddenly, 

while they are unaware of it . 
26:203 Then they shall say: 

Can we be granted respite 

from divine judgment and then believe ? 
26.204 Is it Our imminent torment, then, 

that truly they seek to hasten? 
26:205 Yet have you considered, O Prophet, 

if We were to let them enjoy themselves 

for years, 

26:206 whereupon all that they have been promised 

as to divine judgment came to them? 
26:207 Would that respite of time 

which they were given to enjoy 

have availed them at all ? 
26:208 Yet never have We destroyed any town 

without it having had messengers 

come to it as forewarners 
of God's nearing Judgment , 
26:209 as a reminder to them of God's way . 

For never do We wrong anyone 

that divine destruction befalls .

26:210 Thus as for the Quran, 

the satans have not 

brought it down to the Prophet 

as the godless wrongdoers claim ! 
26:2ii Nor is it for the likes of them to do so ! 

Nor can they! 
26:212 Indeed, they are far removed 

from even hearing its verses being revealed 
26:213 Then you shall not, 

O human being , 

call upon any other god with God. 

For then you will become 

one of those who are punished. 
26:214 So forewarn, O Prophet, 

your nearest relatives. 
26:215 And lower your wing of compassion 

for the believers who follow you. 
26:216 Yet if they who disbelieve 

disobey you, then say: 

Indeed, I am innocent of all that you do. 
26:217 Thus rely only 

upon the Overpowering One , 

the Mercy- Giving — 
26:218 the One who sees you 

when you rise at night for the Prayer, 
26:219 and who sees you 

in the postures of your Prayer 

among those who bow their faces 

down to the ground, 

worshipping Him alone . 
26:220 Indeed, it is He 

who is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. 

26:221 Shall I tell you, O disbelievers, 
upon whom it is that the satans 
do, indeed , descend?

26:225 Do you not see 

that they but wander in their verse aimlessly, 

as if from valley to valley, 
26:226 and that they say in their poetry 

what they do not do? 
26:227 Excepted are those poets who believe, 

and do righteous deeds, 

and remember God much, 

and who seek to make the believers triumphant 
after they have been wronged 

by the disbelievers . 
Yet all those who do wrong,

you are, most surely, receiving the Quran 
from One who is all-wise, all-knowing. 

27:7 Behold! Moses said to his family: 

Indeed, I have noticed a fire. 

From it, I shall bring you some news 
to guide us on our way , 

or bring you a flaming firebrand, 

so that you may warm yourselves. 
27:8 So when he came to it, he was called by God : 

Blessed be whoever 

is in the effulgence of the fire 

and whoever is around it! 

For highly exalted is God alone , 

Lord of All the Worlds! 
27:9 O Moses! Indeed, it is I! 

I am God, 

the Overpowering One , the All- Wise. 
27:io Now throw your staff to the ground . 
Then when he saw it moving 
as if it were a great serpent, he turned and fled- 
and would not turn back. 

God said: O Moses! 
Have no fear! 
For in My presence, 
messengers have nothing to fear. 
27:ii Even should one have done wrong, 
then replaced iniquity with good — 
still, I am, indeed, all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 
27:12 Moreover, let your hand 

enter the bosom of your garment. 
It shall come forth 

radiant white, without blemish. 

This is one of the nine miraculous signs 

that you shall show to Pharaoh and his people.

Indeed, they have been an ungodly people. 
27:13 Yet when Our signs came to them, 

manifest before their very eyes, they said: 

This is clear sorcery! 
27:14 Thus, even though, within their souls, 

they were certain of them being from God — 

they disavowed them, wrongfully and haughtily. 

So see how devastating was the end 

of the sowers of corruption! 

27:15 Now, indeed, We gave David and Solomon 

revealed knowledge, as well . 

And ever did they say: 

All praise is for God alone 

who has favored us above many 

of His believing servants. 
27:16 Thus Solomon inherited prophethood 

and the throne from David, wherefore he said: 

O people! 

We have been taught to comprehend 
the utterance of birds. 
Moreover, we have been given 

something of nearly every good thing 

in the world . 

Indeed, this is most surely evidence 
of manifest favor from God . 
27:17 So assembled before Solomon 
were his hosts — 

from the jinn, and the human beings, 
and the birds. 

Thus were they duly marshaled 
to march in force . 
27:18 And at last, 

when they came upon the Valley of Ants, 
an ant said: O you ants!

and said in gratitude : My Lord! 

Dispose me always 

to give thanks for Your grace, 

with which You have graced me 

and my parents, 

and that I do righteous deeds 

with which You are pleased. 

And admit me, by Your mercy, 

into the company of Your righteous servants. 
27:20 And so he reviewed the birds. 

Then he said: 

Why do I not see the hoopoe, 

or is he of those who are absent without leave ? 
27:2i I shall, most surely, punish him 

with a severe punishment; 

or I shall, most surely, slaughter him, 

unless he brings me a clear warrant 

for his absence . 
27:22 Yet he remained away — but not for long. 

Then he came and said: 

I have compassed a momentous matter 

which you, O Solomon, have not compassed! 

For I have come to you from the land of Sheba 

with sure news. 
27:23 Indeed, I found a woman ruling over them — 

and she has been given 

something of nearly every good thing 

in the world . 

Moreover, she has a magnificent throne.

instead of bowing to God. 

For Satan has made their godless works 

fair-seeming to them. 

Thus has he barred them from the path of God , 
and, therefore, they are not rightly guided, 
27:25 so that they do not 

bow their faces down to God — 
though He is the One 
who brings out all that is hidden 
in the heavens and the earth, 
and who alone knows what you keep secret 
and what you make known. 

27:26 God! 

There is no God but Him, 

the Lord of the Magnificent Throne!^ 
27:27 Solomon said to the hoopoe : 

We shall see whether you have spoken the truth 

or if you are to be counted 

as one of the sheer liars. 
27:28 Go with this letter of mine 

to the court of Sheba . 

Then cast it down to them. 

Then turn aside from them. 

Then see what answer they shall return. 
27:29 When the letter reached the Queen, she said: 

O assembly of nobles: 

An honorable letter has been cast down to me. 
27.30 It is from Solomon. And it is written herein : 

In the name of God, 

the All-Merciful, the Mercy-Giving. 
27:31 Do not exalt yourselves against me 

in defiance of revealed truth . 

Rather, come to me as muslims, 

in willing submission to God alone .

Thus the command is yours, O Queen . 

Consider, then, what you shall command. 
27:34 She said: 

Indeed, when kings enter a city, 

they spread corruption in it. 

Moreover, they reduce its people of dignity 

to abject humility — 

and this is, indeed, what they do! 
27:35 Thus, I am sending to them a gift in response . 

Then I will consider 

that wherewith the messengers I send return. 
27:36 So when her envoy came to him, 
Solomon said: 

Would you extend to me mere wealth? 
Yet what God has given me 
is far better than all that He has given you. 
Rather, you are exultant 
with regard to your gift. 
27:37 Return to them, O messengers, 

those who have sent you bearing gifts . 
For, most surely, 

we shall come to them with hosts 

the like of which 

they shall never be able to face. 

Moreover, we shall, most surely, expel them 

from their land in abject humility. 

Thus shall they be abased!

27:38 Thereafter, when Solomon anticipated 
her coming to him, he said to his court : 

0 assembly of nobles! 

Which of you will bring me her throne 
before they come to me in willing submission? 
27:39 One of great power serving Solomon 
from the jinn said: 

1 shall bring it to you 

before you rise from your position. 
For I am, indeed, the one for such a task, 
being both very strong and trustworthy. 
27:40 Yet he who had knowledge 
from the Heavenly Book said: 
I shall bring it to you 
even before the glance of your eye 
to the sky can return to you! 
So the moment he beheld it 
settled before him, Solomon said: 
This is of my Lord's favor upon me , to try me, 
as to whether I will be thankful to Him 
or ungrateful. 

Yet anyone who is thankful to God 
is but thankful for the good of his own soul. 
And whoever is ungrateful — then, nevertheless, 
my Lord is self-sufficient, all-generous! 
27:4i He said: 

Alter the appearance of her throne 

so it becomes unfamiliar to her, 

so that we may see 

whether she shall follow right guidance 
after seeing this miracle , 
or if she will remain of those 
who are not guided aright. 
27:42 So when she arrived at his court , 
it was said to her :

Does your throne resemble this one ? 
She said: It is as though it were it itself! 
Then and there, 

perceiving her inclination to truth, 

Solomon said to his court : 

It is we who have been given 

revealed knowledge long before her. 

And ever have we been muslims, 

in willing submission to God alone . 
27:43 What she had been 

habituated to worshipping apart from God 

caused her at first to turn away from faith . 

For, indeed, she was from a disbelieving people. 
27:44 It was said to her: Enter the palace court. 

So when she saw it, she thought it was 

an expansive, rippling pool. 

So she bared her shins to cross it . 

He said: 

It is but a court of polished glass plates 

overlaying water. 

Suddenly, realizing the truth, 

she turned to God in prayer and said: 

My Lord! 

I have, indeed, wronged myself 
by worshipping the sun . 
And I now submit myself with Solomon 
to God alone , Lord of All the Worlds. 

27:45 And very truly, 

We sent to the people of Thamud, 
their brother Salih as a messenger, saying : 
Worship God alone ! 
And, at once, they became divided 
into two contending factions 
of faith and unbelief .

Why do you hasten 

to bring evil doom upon yourselves 

instead of the good tidings of faith ? 

Will you not seek God's forgiveness, 

so that you may be shown mercy? 
27:47 They said to him : 

We presage an omen of ill fate from you 

and from those who believe along with you. 

He said: 

Your deserved fate, good or ill, 

rests with God alone . 

Rather, you are a people 

who have been put to trial by Him . 
27:48 There were in the city nine men, 

heads of their clans, 

who spread corruption in the earth 

and did not set things aright. 
27:49 They said: 

Swear to one another, by God,

and his household and kill them all ! 

Then we shall say emphatically 

to any heir of his that seeks retribution

at the annihilation of his household — 

and that , indeed, we are, most surely, truthful! 
27:50 Thus they who disbelieved 

devised a wicked plan against Salih . 

But We devised a plan to save him — 

while they were entirely unaware of it .

27:53 Yet We delivered from destruction

Behold! He said to his people: 

Do the men among you openly commit 

such abominable lewdness with each other ,

27:55 Do you approach men in lust instead of women? 

Indeed, you are a people

was only to say to each other : 

Expel the family of Lot from your town,

who seek to keep themselves pure 

from our ways . 
27:57 So We delivered him 

and his family from doom — 

except his faithless wife: 

Her We adjudged to be among those 

who would linger behind. 
27:58 Thus We rained down upon them

so that you shall know them to be utterly true . 

For never is your Lord at all heedless

These are the revealed verses 

of the clear Book of God elucidating truth . 

We recite to you, in truth, 

something of the great tiding 

of Moses and Pharaoh, 

for a people who would believe 

in divine revelation . 
Indeed, Pharaoh exalted himself 
with lawless insolence in the land of Egypt 
and segregated its people into factions, 
oppressing a group of them, 
slaying their sons 

and keeping their womenfolk alive in bondage 
Indeed, he was of those 
who sowed corruption on earth . 
Yet We intended to confer favor 
on those oppressed in the land 
and to make them exemplary leaders in faith ; 
and to make them inheritors 
of Our commandments ; 
and to establish them securely in the land;

and to show Pharaoh 

and Haman and their hosts, by means of them, 

the fulfillment of the very fear 

that they were so vigilantly guarding against. 
28:7 So We revealed to Moses' mother, 

after she had delivered him : Nurse him. 

Then when you fear for his life , 

cast him into the river in a basket . 

And do not fear Pharaoh ; 

and do not grieve over this parting . 

Indeed, We shall, most surely, 

return him to you. 

And We shall make him 
one of the messengers of God. 
28:8 Thereafter, the House of Pharaoh 

retrieved him from the River Nile — 

that he might become for them in time 

an enemy and a cause of grief. 

Indeed, Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts 

were a sinful people . 
28:9 So the wife of Pharaoh said to Pharaoh: 

He can be a joy to the eye for me and for you. 

Do not kill him. 

He may benefit us, or we may take him as a son. 
For they had no sense 
of what God would do through him . 
28:io Yet the heart of Moses' mother 

became devoid of feeling for all but Moses, 
to the point 

that she very nearly disclosed his identity , 
had We not secured her heart 
to be of the believers of unfailing faith . 
28:ii Thus she said to his sister: Trail him. 
So she watched over him from afar, 
though they who had retrieved him

28:12 •JicThus before returning him to his mother , 
We caused him to abstain from all wet-nurses. 
Then his sister came forth, 
and she said to them : 

Shall I direct you to the people of a household 
who will foster him for you 
and who will treat him well? 
28:13 Thus did We restore him to his mother, 
so that her eyes might be comforted 
and find joy in him , 
and that she might not grieve, 
and that she might know 
that the promise of God is ever true. 
Yet most of them who disbelieve 
do not know that God's will is ever done . 

28:14 And when he had reached full maturity 

and become full-grown, 

We gave him prophetic wisdom 

and knowledge of God — 

and thus do We reward 

those who excel in doing good. 
28:15 But, before this, 

he had entered the city of Pharaoh 

at a time of midday rest 

when its dwellers were unaware 
of activities therein, 

and wherein he found 

two men fighting each other: 

One from his own people 

and one from his enemies. 

The one from his own people 

cried out for his help

So Moses struck him who was of the enemy 

with his fist and finished him, 

and said in regret : 

This is of the doings of Satan. 

He is, indeed, a manifest, misguiding enemy. 
28:16 He said: My Lord! 

I have, indeed, wronged myself, so forgive me; 

so He forgave him. 

Indeed, He is the All-Forgiving, 

the Mercy-Giving. 
28:17 He said: My Lord! 

Because of all of that 

with which you have graced me, 

I shall never be an upholder 

of the defiant unbelievers. 
28:18 Thus by morning, 

he had become fearful and wary, 

in the streets of the city. 

Then when the man who had sought his help 

the day before cried out to him for help again , 

Moses said to him: 

Indeed, you are clearly 

a most quarrelsome fellow . 
28.19 So when he intended again 

to assault the one who was an enemy 

to both of them, the enemy said to him : 

O Moses! 

Do you intend to kill me

You want merely to become a tyrant

So depart at once from this land ! 
I am, indeed, one of those 
who sincerely mean you well. 
28:21 So at once he departed from it, 
fearful and wary. 
He said: My Lord! 

Deliver me from the wrongdoing people. 
28:22 And when he turned his face 

toward the land of Midian, he said: 

It may be that my Lord 

will guide me upon the most even way. 

28:23 So when at last 

he had reached the water wells of Midian, 

he found there a large group of people 

drawing water for their herds . 

And standing apart from them, 

he found two women holding back their flock . 

He said: What is it that makes you do this? 

They said: We cannot water our flock 

until the shepherds drive away their herds . 

For our father is an aged man, 
and we are his only helpers . 
28.24 So he watered the flock for them. 

Then he turned aside 

to the shade of a tree and said: 

My Lord! 

Of whatever good You may send down to me, 
most surely, I am most needful. 
28:25 One of the two women 

then came back to him, walking bashfully.

Truly, my father calls for you

So when he came to him 

and related to him the story 

of his escape from Egypt, the father said: 

Have no fear. 

You have been delivered 

from the wrongdoing people 

who are godless in heart . 
28:26 One of the two women said: 

My dear father! Hire him. 

Indeed, the best man you could hire 

is one like him who is strong and trustworthy. 
28:27 The father said: 

I wish to marry you

provided you hire yourself out to me 

for eight years. 

And should you decide to complete ten years , 

then it shall be of your own free will. 

Nor do I desire to bring hardship upon you. 

You shall find me, if God so wills,

28:28 Moses said: 

This is agreed upon between me and you. 

Whichever of the two terms I fulfill, 

then I shall not come under any duress. 

And God is a guardian over all that we say.

28:3i Now throw your staff to the ground . 

Then when he saw it moving 
as if it were a great serpent, 
he turned and fled — 
and would not turn back. 
God said: O Moses! 
Come near, and have no fear, 
for you are, indeed,

28:32 Pass your hand into the bosom of your garment. 

It shall come forth

I know of no god for you other than me. 
So kindle a fire for me, O Haman, 
to bake bricks out of clay. 
Then make for me a lofty tower, 
so that I may ascend it

For they believed, indeed, 

that they would never be returned to Us 

in the Hereafter for Judgment . 
28:40 Then We seized him and his hosts, suddenly, 

and We cast them into the sea. 

So look how devastating was the end 

of the godless wrongdoers who defied Me ! 
28:4i And thus have We made them 

leading exemplars of unbelief , 

calling whoever follows their example 

to the Fire of Hell . 

For on the Day of Resurrection, 

never shall they be helped 

against their punishment . 
28:42 Moreover, 

We have caused a curse to follow them

And on the Day of Resurrection, 

they shall be banished from all goodness . 

28:43 And very truly, 

We did give the Torah as a Scripture to Moses, 

after We had destroyed 

the earlier defiant generations. 

In it were manifest proofs against idolatry 

for all the people of Israel , 

as well as guidance and mercy from God , 

so that they might become mindful

the Commandments. 

Nor were you there

who bore witness to these events . 
28:45 Furthermore, 

We brought forth many generations 
after Moses , 

such that the life spans of heedlessness 
that stretched over them 
grew so very long — 
until they forgot God's Covenant . 
Moreover, you were not there with Moses 
when he was dwelling 
among the people of Midian, 
so that you might rehearse before them 
Our verses regarding Moses' sojourn there, 
so as to verify them . 
Rather, it is We alone 
who have decreed to send you, 
O Prophet, as a messenger 
with these revealed tidings . 
28:46 For you were not there 

on the mountainside of Tur 
when We called Moses 
in the Holy Valley of Tuwa . 
Rather, 

it is We who have sent you, O Prophet, 
with this account, as a mercy from your Lord, 
to forewarn of God's nearing Judgment 
a people to whom no forewarner before you 
has ever come, 

so that they may become mindful 
of God's commandments . 
28:47 And never would We have sent you 
as a forewarner to the unbelievers, 
O Prophet, were it not for the fact 
that when the deadly affliction from God 
strikes them —

for all the evil that their own hands

they would, most surely, say on Judgment Day : 
Our Lord! 

If only You had sent to us a messenger, 

we would then have followed 

Your revealed verses 

and become of those who believed 

in You alone . 
28:48 But when the truth 

came to them from Us in this Quran , 

they who disbelieve said of you, O Prophet : 

If only he were given miracles 

the like of which Moses was given! 

Yet have they themselves not disbelieved 

in what was given to Moses of old? 

They said of both you and Moses, O Prophet: 

They are but two sorcerers, 

upholding one another! 

Moreover, they said: 

Indeed, we disbelieve in both of them! 
28:49 Say to them : 

Then bring a Book from God 

that is more guiding than either 

the Quran or the Torah , 

so that I may follow it, 

if you are truthful about your claims . 
28.50 Thus if they do not respond to you, 

then know that they, in fact, follow 

nothing but their own whims. 

And who could be further astray from the truth 

than one who follows his mere whims 

without any guidance from God?

the word of this Quran to reach them,

of God's commandments . 
28:52 Indeed, those who are pure in heart — 

to whom We had previously 

given the Scripture — believe in this Quran . 
28:53 Thus when it is recited to them, they say: 

We believe in all of it. 

Indeed, it is the very word of Truth 

from our Lord. 

Indeed, even before this

28:54 Believers such as these 

will be given their reward twice 

for having believed in both Revelations, 

and for having been patient 

in keeping their covenants 

and for averting what is evil with what is good. 
Moreover, they spend charitably 
from what We have provided them. 
28:55 Moreover, when they hear vile talk, 
they turn away from it. 

Rather, they say to those who malign them : 

For us shall be the recompense of our deeds 

And for you shall be the recompense 

of your deeds. 

Peace be upon you! 

We do not seek to emulate 

those who are ignorant and belligerent.

Rather, it is God alone who guides 
whomever He so wills. 
For He alone knows best 
those who are truly guided aright. 
28:57 Thus they who disbelieve 
say to you, O Prophet : 
Were we to follow 

the guidance of your God along with you, 

we would be snatched away 

from our own land for abandoning our gods . 

Yet is it not We alone 

who have established for them 

a secure Sanctuary in Makkah , 

to which the fruits of all things are brought 

in abundant provision from Us? 

However, most of them do not know 

that this is from God . 
28:58 Then how many a city have We devastated 

that insolently exulted 

in its bounteous livelihood? 

So there are their dwellings — 

which were never inhabited after them — 

except a very few. 

Rather, it is We alone 

who were the inheritors of it all . 
28:59 But never would your Lord destroy the cities 

of a disbelieving people 

until He had first sent forth a messenger, 

in the midst of their mother-town, 

reciting to them Our verses. 

Nor would We ever destroy any communities 

unless their people 

were wrongdoers, godless in heart .

Do people think that they will be left

Yet, very truly, We have tested 

all those who came before them. 
Thus God shall, most surely,

And He shall, most surely, distinguish the liars. 
Moreover, as to those who do evil deeds, 
do they truly think they shall escape Us? 
So very grievous is the judgment they make! 
Whoever has hope in the Meeting of God 
and His reward in the Hereafter , 
then let him be ready, 
for, indeed, God's term of Judgment 
is certainly coming. 

And He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. 
Thus whoever strives in the path of God 
strives only for the benefit of his own soul.

without any need 

for any of His creation in all the worlds. 

Yet as to those who believe 

and do righteous deeds, 

We shall, most surely, absolve them 

of their misdeeds. 

Moreover, We shall, most surely, reward them 
with the very best they have ever done. 



Now, We have charged each human being 
with dutifulness and goodness 
toward one's parents. 
But if ever they strive to compel you 
to associate gods with Me — 
or command you to anything about which 
you have no sure knowledge from God — 
then do not obey them. 
To Me alone is the return of all of you. 
Then I shall tell you the due recompense 
of all that you have been doing in life . 
Yet as to those who believe 
and do righteous deeds, 

We shall, most surely, admit them to Paradise 
among the righteous. 
29:io But among humankind there are those who say: 
We believe in God. 
But when one of them suffers 
for the sake of God, 
he loses faith and makes it as though 
persecution from people 
were equal to punishment from God. 
But whenever a victory 
comes from your Lord to the believers , 
they, most surely, say: 
Indeed, we were with you!

Does God not know best 
all that inheres within the breast 
of everyone in all the worlds? 
29:ii Thus, most surely, God knows well 
those who have truly believed. 
And, most surely, He knows well 
all the hypocrites. 

29:12 Now, as to those who disbelieve, 

they say to those who believe: 

Follow our way of life 

and we shall bear your sins. 

But they shall bear none of their sins. 

Indeed, they are liars! 
29:13 Yet they will, most surely, 

bear their own burdens of sin — 

and other burdens along with their own burdens 

for perverting others . 

And they will, most surely, be questioned 

on the Day of Resurrection 

about all that they have forged against God . 

29:14 And very truly, We sent Noah to his people. 

So he remained patiently among them 
calling them to worship God 

for a thousand years, less fifty years. 

Then, suddenly, the flood seized them, 

for they were wrongdoers, godless in heart . 
29:15 So We delivered him and the people of the Ark. 

And We made it a sign of admonition, 

preserved for all the worlds.

Behold! He said to his people: 
Worship God alone and fear Him.

That is best for you, 

if only you were to know God's reward for it . 
29:17 Indeed, all that you worship apart from God 
are nothing more than graven images. 
Thus you create no more than fabrications. 
Indeed, those objects you worship 
apart from God 

do not hold even a morsel of provision for you. 
So seek all of your provision from God. 
Therefore, worship Him alone , 
and be thankful to Him. 
To Him alone 

shall you all be returned for Judgment . 

29:18 So if you unbelievers belie God's messenger, 

know that nations before you 

have belied God's messengers , as well. 

Yet nothing is incumbent 

upon the messenger of God 

except the clear conveyance of God's message . 
29:19 Have they not seen how God begins creation, 

then causes it to return to being 

after it passes away ? 

Indeed, that for God is ever so easy. 
29:20 Say, O Prophet, to those who deny 

resurrection in the Hereafter : 

Journey through the earth 

and see the wonder 

of how He originated all creation. 

Thereafter be certain 

that God shall bring into being 

the existence of the Hereafter. 

Indeed, God is powerful over all things.

Nor have you apart from God

29:23 Yet as to those who have disbelieved

was but to say: Kill him, or burn him alive ! 

But God delivered him from the fire 
that they kindled . 

Indeed, in this there are sure signs 

for a people who would believe. 
29:25 For he said to them : 

Indeed, you have taken 

graven images for worship apart from God

29:29 Do the males among you 

approach men in perverted lust ? 

And do you cut the roadway to rob people

And do you openly commit 

lewd abomination in your gatherings?

Support me against these people

29:3i So when Our angel-messengers 

came to Abraham with the glad tiding of a son 

from his wife Sarah , they said: 

Indeed, we are here to destroy 

the people of this township of Sodom . 

Indeed, its people 

have become wrongdoers, godless in heart. 
29:32 Abraham said: 

But Lot resides in it, and he is not of them ! 
They said: 

We are more knowing of who is in it than you . 
Most surely, we shall deliver him 
and his family — except his wife. 
She is of those who shall linger behind. 
29:33 So when Our angel-messengers came to Lot 
in the form of men , 
he was greatly troubled about them. 
Thus he grew helplessly distressed 
concerning them. 
But they said: 

Have no fear, and do not grieve. 

We are God's messengers . 

Indeed, we shall deliver you and your family 

from the doom we bring to your people — 

except your wife. 

She is of those who shall linger behind. 
29:34 Indeed, we shall send down 

upon the people of this township 

a castigation from Heaven

they have committed.

Moreover, you shall not

29:37 But they belied him. 

Then the convulsion

laying prostrate in their dwelling-place. 

29:38 And the peoples of c Ad and Thamud 
were also destroyed for defying God — - 
something that has long been evident 
to you people of Makkah 
from the ruins of their dwellings 
that you pass on your trade routes . 
For Satan made their godless works 
fair-seeming to them and, thereby, 
barred them from the path of God , 
though they were endowed 

with the power to discern truth from falsehood . 

29:39 And so too Korah and Pharaoh and Haman —

Yet never could they escape the grip of God . 
29:40 For each one of them We seized, suddenly, 

with an awesome torment for his sinfulness. 

Such are of the peoples 

God has destroyed for their unbelief. 

So of them are those upon whom We sent 

a raging storm of lethal pellets. 

And of them are those 

who were seized by the deadly blast. 

And of them are those 

whom We caused the earth to swallow. 

And of them are those whom We drowned. 

Yet never would God wrong them 

by punishing them without cause . 

But, rather, it was their own souls 

they were all the while wronging 

with ungodliness . 
29:4i The parable of those who take to themselves 

false gods as patrons to give them shelter 

apart from God, is this : 

They are like the spider. 

It makes for itself a home for refuge 

which cannot avail it against destruction . 

For, indeed, the frailest of all homes

We set forth for the benefit of people.

of your actual partners from among yourselves? 
Never would you accept this! 
Thus do We make distinct the signs 
for a people who would use their reason 
to understand. 
30:29 But those who have done wrong 
by worshipping false gods 
follow only their own whims 
without any revealed knowledge. 
Then who is it that can guide one 
whom God has left to stray? 
Thus for them, there shall not be any helpers 
against God's punishment . 

30:30 Set your face devoutly toward God 
and to the true religion, O Prophet, 
and so too all who would follow you — 
being ever upright in heart ! 
This is the natural disposition 
given you by God, 

upon which He originated all humankind. 

There shall be no altering of God's creation. 

That is the upright way of religion, 

but most people do not know it. 
30:31 -S&amp;So hold fast to it , 

turning always to Him in repentance .

Thus shall you duly establish the Prayer. 

Thus shall you never be of those

For anyone who gives thanks to Him 

gives thanks purely 

for the good of his own soul. 

Yet as to one who is ungrateful — 

then, nevertheless, 

God is, indeed, self-sufficient, all-praised! 
3i:i3 So behold! 

Luqman said to his son, 

while he was admonishing him: 

O my dear son! 

Do not associate anything with God 
in worship . 

Indeed, associating gods with God 
is, most surely, a great wrong. 
3i:i4 Moreover, God has said : 

We have charged each human being 

with dutifulness and goodness 

toward one's parents. 

One's mother bore one 

in feebleness upon feebleness, 

and the full period of one's weaning 

is within two years. 

So give thanks to Me and to your parents. 
To Me is the ultimate destiny. 
3i:i5 But if ever they strive in order to compel you 
to associate gods with Me — 
or command you to anything about which 
you have no sure knowledge from God — 
then do not obey them. 
Yet still keep company with both of them 
in this world, in accordance with what is right. 
But follow the path 
of one who turns to Me in penitence. 
Then to Me shall be your final return 
in the Hereafter .

/ 73 VERSES / REVEALED AT MADINAH 



Al-Ahzab 



IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE ALL-MERCIFUL, THE MERCY-GIVING 



33:1 O Prophet! Be ever God-fearing! 

Thus you shall not yield to the dictates 

of the disbelievers and the hypocrites. 

Indeed, God alone is all-knowing, all-wise. 
33:2 Rather, follow what is revealed to you 

from your Lord. 

Indeed, ever is God all-aware 

of what all of you do. 
33:3 Thus rely on God alone . 

For sufficient is God as a guardian. 
33:4 God has not made 

in the inner being of any man two hearts. 

Nor has He made your wives — 

whom you sinfully estrange 

with the mere pronouncement: 

You are prohibited to me for marital relations 

as is my own mother's backside — 

truly unlawful to you, 

as are your natural mothers. 

Nor has He made those 

whom you call by name 

your sons through adoption 

truly your natural sons.

All this is merely your saying with your mouths. 

But God says the word of truth. 

And it is He alone 

who guides along the straight path. 
335 As to adopted children, 

you shall call them by the names 

that disclose the paternity 

of their natural fathers. 

Such attribution is fairest to them 

in the sight of God. 

Yet if you do not know 

who their natural fathers are, then, still, 

they are no more than your brothers 

in religion and your wards. 

But there is no sin reckoned against you 

wherein you err as to this, 

their proper attribution . 

Rather, you are accountable 

only for what your hearts premeditate. 

And ever is God all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 
33:6 The Prophet, like a father, 

has greater concern 

for the good of the believers 

than they have for their own souls. 

Moreover, his wives are to the believers 

as are their own mothers. 

Still, those who are related by blood 

are more entitled to inherit one another — 

in accordance with what is decreed 

in the Book of God — 

than arc the believers and the Emigres 

to inherit one another — 

with the exception 

that you may enact a bequest 

for your close alliances,

in accordance with what is right. 
This is inscribed 

in the Preserved Book of Heaven . 

33:7 Now, behold! 

We have taken from all the prophets 

their most solemn covenant 
to strive in the way of God 

with all their heart and soul — 

and from you, O Muhammad, 

and from Noah, and Abraham, 

and Moses, and Jesus, son of Mary, 

was it taken with your utmost resolve . 

Thus have We taken from them all 

a profoundly solemn covenant, indeed — 
33:8 in order that He may question 

the truthful believers on Judgment Day 

and reward them for their truthfulness. 

Yet He has prepared for the disbelievers 

a most painful torment. 

33:9 O you who believe! 

Recall, then, the grace of God upon you 
when an alliance of armed forces 
advanced against you 
in the Battle of Al-Ahzab to besiege you , 
and We sent against them a mighty wind 
and Heavenly hosts that you did not see. 
Yet ever is God all-seeing of all that you do. 

33:io Behold!

and you believers thought untrue thoughts 

about God — 
33:ii then and there the believers were tested 

and they were shaken — 

violently shaken, with dreadful fear. 
33:12 It was then when the hypocrites, 

and those in whose doubting hearts 

there is a sickness, were saying: 

God and His Messenger 

have promised us nothing but a delusion! 
33:13 Moreover, a group of them said: 

O people of Yathrib! 

There is no way for you to stand 
before the enemy . 

Thus return home . 

And yet another party of them 

asked the Prophet permission to retreat , saying: 

Indeed, our homes are exposed to danger ! 

Yet they were not thus exposed. 

They desired only to flee. 
33:14 And had they been overrun 

from the quarters of the city , 

and were they, then, asked to break faith 

with you believers , they would have done it — 

and tarried not even an instant therein. 
33:15 Yet, very truly, 

they had made a solemn covenant 

with God before, 

swearing that they would never turn away 
in retreat. 

And, most surely, any covenant of God 
shall be answered for. 
33:16 Say to them, O Prophet : 

Flight from battle shall never benefit you. 
For even if you were to escape from death,

or from being killed — even so, 

you would not be allowed enjoyment of life 

but for a little while longer . 
33:17 Say to them : 

Who is it that shall preserve you 

from the reach of God, 

whether He intends for you harm 

or He intends for you mercy? 

Rather, they shall not find for themselves 

apart from God either patron or supporter. 
33:18 Truly, God knows well 

the hinderers among you, 

those who discourage striving in His path, 

as well as those who say 

to their brothers in hypocrisy : 

Come over to us and abandon the believers ! 

Thus they do not join the battle, except a little, 
33:19 begrudging support to you. 

But when the fear of battle comes near , 

you see them looking at you, 

their eyes rolling like one fainting 

in the throes of death. 

Yet when the fear goes, 

they flail you believers with sharp tongues, 

avaricious after the worldly goods of spoil . 

Such as these have not believed. 

Thus God has rendered utterly futile 

their good works — 

and that, for God, is ever easy. 
33:20 Still terrified, 

they think that the Federated Clans 

have not gone away completely . 

And were the Federated Clans to come back, 

they would wish that they themselves 

were far-off desert dwellers

among the Bedouins 

asking for news about you. 

And even if they were still among you then, 

they would not fight, except a little. 

33:21 Yet, very truly, in the Messenger of God 
there is an excellent model for you — 
for whoever has hope in God 
and for salvation on the Last Day 
and, therefore , remembers God much. 

33:22 Thus when the true believers 

saw the Federated Clans advancing 

to besiege them , they said: 

This is what God and His Messenger 

have promised us of trial and triumph . 

Indeed, God and His Messenger 

have spoken the truth. 

Thus it only increased them in faith, 

and in pure submission to God . 

33:23 Among the believers 

are men who have truly fulfilled 
what they have covenanted with God. 
Thus of them are those who have fulfilled 
their solemn vow of faith with their very lives 
And of them, 

are those who await its fulfillment . 
For unlike the hypocrites, 
they have not altered their covenant 
with even the slightest alteration. 
33:24 Therefore, God shall reward the truthful 
for their unfailing truthfulness, 
and torment the hypocrites — if He so wills — 
or grant them repentance. 

Indeed, ever is God all-forgiving, mercy-giving.

You must hold fast to your wife and fear God! 

Thus you suppressed within yourself

You have feared the impression of people.

Then, when you have partaken, 
disperse, all of you, and do not linger,

However, God does not refrain

Furthermore, with respect to his wives, 
whenever you ask them for any article, 
then ask them from behind a screen. 
That is sure to deepen

For such as these there is forgiveness

awaiting in the Hereafter .

to confute Our revealed verses — 

so as to frustrate 

the establishment of Our message —

see clearly, O Prophet, 
that what has been sent down to you 
from your Lord is the utter truth 
and that it guides to the way 
of the Overpowering One , the All-Praised. 

34:7 But those who disbelieve say in mockery : 
Shall we direct you to a man 
who will prophesy to you 
that when you are utterly shattered 
into fragments in the grave , 
that you shall, indeed, be brought forth 
alive and whole in a new creation? 

34:8 Has he forged a lie against God, 
or has he madness in him? Not so! 
Rather, those who do not believe 
in the Hereafter 

shall be in the torment of Hell therein

how completely they are surrounded 
by all that is before them 
and all that is behind them 
of the sky and the earth? 
If We so will, 

We cause the earth to sink with them, 
or We drop upon them deadly patches of sky. 
Indeed, in all of this there is a sure sign 
for every penitent servant. 

34:io -Sic And very truly, before you, O Prophet, 
We gave David, a mere shepherd, 
great favor from Us, decreeing : 
O mountains! Echo with him My praises . 
And O birds! Sing praise with him, as well. 
Moreover, 

it is We who made iron pliant for him, 
and then said to him: 
34:ii Make full suits of mail 

and make exact the measure 
in composing the links. 

Yet work righteousness, O Family of David . 
For, indeed, I am all-seeing of all that you do. 
34:12 Then to Solomon, We subjugated the wind. 
Its morning course easing for him a distance 
that was otherwise attained in a month. 
And its evening course also 
was as the j ourney of a month. 
Moreover, We caused a spring 
of molten brass to fl ow for him. 
And of the jinn 

were those who worked before him, 
subjugated by the permission of his Lord. 
Thus whoever among them 
swerved from Our command,

We made him taste 

something of the torment of a flaming fire. 
34:13 They made for him whatever he so willed 
of sanctuanes and sculpture 
and mortars like great basins 
and anchored caldrons. 
And We said to them: 

Work, O Family of David, in thanksgiving! 
Yet few of My servants 
are abundantly thankful. 
34:14 And so it was for Solomon 

that when finally We decreed death for him, 
nothing gave indication 
to the jinn among them of his death, 
except a grub of the earth 
eating away his scepter as he leaned on it . 
Thereafter, when he fell to the ground, 
only then did it become apparent to the jinn 
that Solomon was dead ; 
for had they known 

the knowledge of the unseen, as some claim, 

never would they have remained 

in such a condition of disgracing torment. 

34:15 Very truly, there was a sign 

of God's graciousness 
for the people of Sheba 
in the arrangement of their dwelling place: 
Two vast and plenteous gardens, 

one to the right of it and one to the left. 

And it was said to them: 

Eat from the provision of your Lord. 

And give thanks to Him 

for an exceedingly good habitation 
and for being an all-forgiving Lord.

So We loosed upon them 

the raging torrent of the c Arim Dam . 

Thus We gave them 

in exchange for their two lush gardens 

two other gardens 

of bitter yield and tamarisk-trees 

and some sparse growth of jujube trees. 
34:17 With this did We recompense them 

because they disbelieved. 

Yet are there any but the unbelieving ingrates 
that We recompense like this ? 
34:18 For We had set between them in Yemen 
and the towns in Palestine , 
wherein We had conferred blessing, 
other conspicuous towns. 
Thus We had measured out by stages 
the journey between each of them: 
And it was said: 

Journey through them by night or by day, 
with ease and security.

in deliberate contempt of Our blessing :

Further the distance between our travels. 
Thus they wronged themselves. 
So We made them a byword of reproach 
among the nations . 

Thus We shattered them into fragments 
and scattered them among the peoples — 
shattering them utterly.

any compelling authority over them 

other than the power of evil suggestion — 

so that We might distinguish 

one who believes in the Hereafter 

from one who has doubt concerning it. 

For your Lord alone 

is all-preserving over all things. 
34:22 Say to those who disbelieve, O Prophet : 

Call in vain upon those 

whom you allege to be gods apart from God! 
For they hold 

not even an atom's weight of authority — 
neither in the heavens nor in the earth. 
Nor do they have any partnership 
in the creation of either of them. 
Nor does He have any upholder

is any intercession with Him — 
except for whomever He permits it . 
Then, at long last, 

when God reveals to them His permission — 
and terror subsides from their hearts —

It is You who are our only God and Patron,

The surah that opens with the praise of God as the SOLE ORIGINATOR of the 
heavens and the earth. 



Surah : / 45 VERSES / REVEALED AT MAKKAH 




IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE ALL-MERCIFUL, THE MERCY-GIVING 



35:1 All praise is for God alone, 

Sole Originator of the heavens and the earth, 
Maker of the angels, as messengers with wings- 
two-, three-, and four-fold. 
He increases in creation whatever He so wills. 
Indeed, God is powerfal over all things. 

35:2 Whatever stores of mercy 
God opens for people, 

then there is none to withhold any part of it. 
Yet whatever of it He withholds, 
then there is none other than Him 
to send it forth. 
For He alone 

is the Overpowering One , the All- Wise. 

35:3 O humankind! 

Remember with all your heart 

the surpassing grace of God upon you! 

Is there any creator other than God 

who provides for you 

from the heaven and the earth? 

There is no God but Him. 

How, then, are you turned away

from worshipping Him alone ? 
35:4 Yet if they reject this message 

and belie you, O Prophet, then do not grieve . 

For messengers before you 

have been belied by their peoples. 

Yet , indeed, to God alone 

are all matters returned for just Judgment . 

35:5 O humankind! 

Indeed, God's promise 

to resurrect you for Judgment is ever true. 

So do not let your perception 

of the life of this world delude you. 

And do not let Satan, 

the Arch-Deluder, delude you 

about God in the least ! 
35:6 Indeed, Satan is an enemy to you. 

So take him as an enemy. 

He but calls his alliance with zealous intensity 

to be of the companions 

of the Flaming Fire of Hell. 
35:7 As to those who disbelieve, 

for them there is a severe torment 

awaiting in the Hereafter . 

Yet those who believe and do righteous deeds 

shall have forgiveness and a great reward. 
35:8 Is, then, one to whom the evil of his own deeds 

is made fair-seeming by Satan — 

so that he sees them as good — 

like one whom God has guided ? 

Yet know that God does, indeed, 

leave to stray whomever He so wills. 

And He alone guides whomever He so wills. 

So, O Prophet, do not let yourself 

waste away with regret over them. 

Indeed, God is all-knowing of all that they do.

then invincibility is altogether with God.

For it is He who elevates the righteous deed. 

But those who devise evil deeds, 

for them there is a severe torment

Thus the plotting of such as these 

shall come to ruin. 
35:ii Moreover, it is God alone 

who has created you, O human beings, 

from dust, then from a sperm-drop. 

Then He has made of you pairs, 
male and female . 

No female conceives, or delivers, 

but that it is with His knowledge. 

And no aged person is given long life, 

nor is anyone's life shortened, dying young , 

but that it is registered in a clear Book 

preserved in Heaven . 

Indeed, that for God is ever so easy. 
35:12 Nor are the two kinds of waters 

that God alone has created the same: 

This one sweet, fresh and pleasant to drink; 

and that one salty, acrid. 

Yet from each you eat tender meat 

and you bring forth ornaments that you wear.

not as we used to do! 

God shall say: 

Did We notgiveyou lifetime enough, 

wherein the heart of one longing 

to become mindful of the covenant with Me 

could have become mindful? 

Moreover, 

the forewarner of this very Judgment 
came to you with My own admonition. 
Yet him you belied ! 
So taste now the Fire you denied ! 
For there is not any helper, then, 
to heed the godless wrongdoers' cry . 
35:38 Indeed, God is the Knower 
of all the realms 

of the unseen of the heavens and the earth. 
Indeed, He is all-knowing 
of all that is harbored 
within the breast of people . 
35:39 He is the One 

who has made you successors in the earth, 
to inherit those that preceded you . 
Thus whoever disbelieves in God 
shall himself bear the consequences 
of his unbelief.

Moreover, the unbelief of the disbelievers 
only increases them in the sight of their Lord 
in utter abhorrence. 
Therefore, the unbelief of the disbelievers 
only increases them with their Lord 
in utmost loss! 
35:40 Say to them, then : 

Have you ever considered the desolate reality 

of your associate-gods 

whom you call upon apart from God? 

Show me what they have created of the earth! 

Or do they have any share with God 

in the creation 

or in the sovereignty of the heavens? 
Or is it that We have given them 
a Heavenly Book, 
such that they hold clear proof 
of the truth of their associate-gods from it? 
Rather, 

the godless wrongdoers promise one another 

nothing but utter delusion. 
35:4i Indeed, it is God alone 

who holds the heavens and the earth 

from passing away. 

And, if ever they were to pass away, 

most surely, there is none other than Him 

who could hold them in place thereafter . 

Indeed, ever is He 

most forbearing, all-forgiving. 
35:42 Moreover, they who disbelieve 

have before sworn by God 

with the utmost of their vows 

that if ever a forewarner were to come to them 
as a prophet from God , 

they would, most surely, be the most guided 
of any one of the faith communities

forewarned by a prophet before them . 
Yet when a forewarner came to them 
from God , 

it increased them in nothing but aversion; 
35:43 for they were insolently arrogant in the land 
and sinfully devising evil. 
Yet never does the ill consequence 
of devising evil 

truly ensnare anyone but its perpetrators. 
Do they await, then, anything but the likes 
of the way of God's divine judgment, 
which befell the earlier generations? 
For never will you find 

in the established way of God any alteration! 

And never will you find 

in the established way of God any change! 
35:44 Have they not journeyed through the lands 

to see how devastating was the end 

of those who denied faith before them? 

They were, indeed, 

far greater than them in power. 

Yet there is not a single thing — 

neither in the heavens nor in the earth — 

that can frustrate the will of God. 

Indeed, ever is He all-knowing, all-powerful. 
35:45 And were God to hold people accountable 

in this world with no respite 

for what they have earned in misdeeds , 

He would not leave on the surface of the earth 

a single living creature. 

However, He defers them 

to a stated term for reckoning 

known only to Him . 

But at last , when their term comes due — 
then know that , indeed, ever is God 
all-seeing, of all the deeds of His servants.

36:9 Moreover, before them, We have set a barrier 

to seeing God's signs ; 

and behind them is a barrier to His signs . 

Thus have We enveiled them 

in their obstinacy . So they cannot see. 
36:io So it is the same to them 

whether you forewarn them 

of the consequence of unbelief 

or you do not forewarn them. 

They will not believe. 
36:ii Indeed, you can only forewarn

Therefore, give to such a one

For all things have We enumerated

36:16 They said to the townspeople :

36.33 And a manifest sign to them of the truth 

of their own resurrection is the dead earth. 

We give life to it and bring forth from it grain. 

Then from it they eat. 
36:34 Moreover, We make therein gardens 

of date palms and grapevines,

For each, within a course,

36:45 Still, they turn away when it is said to them: 

Fear what lies ahead of you 

in God's nearing Judgment , 

and what has gone before you 

in the doom of the godless , 

so that you may be shown mercy! 
36:46 Yet not a single sign of God's Oneness

for whomever We advance to old age, 

We do reduce him in strength 

in that stage of his creation.

36:69 Moreover, as to Muhammad, 

never have We taught him poetry 

by this revelation — 

nor does it at all befit him as God's Messenger . 

Rather, this Book is but a revealed Reminder 

and a clear Quran — 
36:70 to forewarn whoever is truly alive

and so that the word of God's torment 

against the inveterate disbelievers is fulfilled.

with Our mighty Hands 

We have created cattle for them,

who have tamed these cattle for them. 

Thus some of them they ride. 

And some of them they eat. 
36:73 Moreover, they have in them other benefits,

most of the earliest generations 

of humanity went astray —

Noah cried out to Us for help . 

And how utterly commendable 

were We who answered! 
37:76 Thus We delivered him and his family 

from the great anguish of the Flood . 
37:77 And it was his offspring that We made 

the sole surviving ones! 
37:78 Moreover, We perpetuated for him 

his good name among the latter generations: 
37:79 Peace forever be upon Noah 

among all the peoples of the world! 
37:80 Indeed, thus do We reward 

those who excel in doing good. 
37:8i For, indeed, he was one 

of Our true believing servants 

whom We saved . 
37:82 Then We drowned the others who disbelieved . 

37:83 ^Moreover, from his confirmed alliance 

was, most surely, Abraham, 
37:84 when he came to his Lord 

with a pure heart full of faith . 
37:85 Behold! 

He said to his own father and his people: 

What are you worshipping? 
37:86 Is it a mere fabrication — 

gods apart from the true God — that you desire? 
37:87 What, then, has become of your belief 

in the Lord of All the Worlds? 
37:88 Then he took a contemplative look at the stars. 
37:89 Then he said: Indeed, I shall be sick! 
37:90 So they turned away from him, 

leaving him behind, 
37:9i whereupon 

he swiftly advanced toward their gods,

and he said to them : 

Will you not eat the offerings ? 
37:92 What is with you that you do not talk? 
37:93 Then swiftly he advanced against them, 

striking them with his right hand. 
37:94 So when his people returned , 

they fell upon him hurriedly. 
37:95 He said: 

Do you worship what you yourselves carve out 

of substances and stone, 
37:96 though it is God alone who has created you 

and all that you do? 
37:97 They said: Build a kiln for him! 

Then throw him into the blazing fire! 
37:98 They endeavored mightily to plot against him. 

But We made them the lowest of the abased . 
37:99 He said: I am leaving to the path of my Lord. 

He shall, most surely, guide me. 
37:ioo He prayed: My Lord! 

Grant me a child who shall be of the righteous. 
37:i«i Thereafter, We gave him glad tidings 

of a most forbearing boy. 
37:102 So when he had attained to an age 

of striving with him in good works, 

Abraham said: O my dear son! 

I have seen in a dream that I am to sacrifice you. 

So consider this, and tell me what you think? 

He said: O my dear father! 

Do what you are commanded by God . 

You shall find me, if God so wills, 

among those who are patient. 
37:103 So at last, 

when they had willingly submitted themselves 

to the will of God , 

and he had laid him down for sacrifice,

37:104 We then called out to him: O Abraham! 
37:105 Truly, you have confirmed 

the truth revealed in your vision. 

And thus do We reward 

those who excel in doing good. 
37:106 Indeed, this was most surely 

a manifest test for father and son . 
37:107 But We spared his son 

and ransomed him 

with a sacrifice of a magnificent offering. 
37:108 Moreover, We perpetuated for him 

his good name among the latter generations: 
37:109 Peace forever be upon Abraham! 
37:iio Thus do We reward 

those who excel in doing good. 
37:in For, indeed, he was one 

of Our true believing servants 

whom We saved . 
37:ii2 Moreover, We gave him 

glad tidings of the birth of another son, Isaac, 

who would be a prophet 

and one of the righteous. 
37:ii3 Thus did We bestow 

abundant blessings upon him and upon Isaac. 

So of their descendants are those who excel 

in doing good — 

and those who clearly wrong their own souls. 

37:ii4 And very truly We have conferred favor 

upon Moses and Aaron, 
37:115 wherefore We delivered them 

and their people 

from the great anguish of oppression . 
37:ii6 For We supported them against Pharaoh .

37:ii9 Moreover, We perpetuated for both of them 

their good names among the latter generations:

and leave the best of Creators? 
37:126 God alone is your Lord,

We delivered him and his family, all together-

He ran away to the overladen ship 

and it fell into peril .

and became one of the castaways. 
37:142 Thereupon, the whale gulped him, 

and he was blameworthy.

who highly exalted God alone , 
37:144 he would have remained in its belly 

until the Day all are raised up for Judgment . 
37:145 -SfcThus We hurled him into the wilderness, 

while he was sick. 
37:146 And We caused to grow over him 

a tree of gourds for shade . 
37:147 Then We sent him back to the city 

of a hundred thousand people —

37:H8 Thus they believed. 

So We gave them enjoyment in life , for a time.

and inquire of them 

regarding their false claims . 

Is it that your Lord has daughters, 

while they would betake to themselves 

only sons? 
37:150 Or is it, in fact, the case 

that We have created the angels as females, 

while they were present as witnesses? 
37:i5i It is most surely, 

out of their utter fabrication 

that they do, indeed, say: 
37:152 God has begotten offspring ! 

And, indeed, they are most certainly sheer liars! 
37.153 Why would He choose daughters 

over sons? 
37:154 What has become of you? 

How do you make 

such an unfounded judgment? 
37:155 Will you not, then,

that you have some clear revealed authority

By the Quran! 
This is a divine Reminder 
endowed with plenary admonition! 
Yet those who disbelieve are utterly lost 
in self-glory and defiance. 
How many a generation before them 
have We destroyed for ungodliness . 
They cried out in repentance 
at their destruction , 
but no longer was there time 
to escape the judgment of God . 
Yet, still they wonder that there has come, 
from among themselves, 

a prophet as a forewarner of Judgment Day . 
For the disbelievers have said of him : 
This is a sorcerer! A sheer liar! 
Has he made all the gods to be One God? 
Indeed, this is a most astounding thing! 
And so the assembly of elders among them 

in Makkah proceeded to exhort the people : 
Go on steadfastly , and persevere 

in adhering to your gods.

This is nothing but a fiction. 
38:8 Has the revealed Reminder 

been sent down upon him alone 

out of all of us? 

Rather, they are in complete doubt 

about My Reminder. 

Rather, they have not yet tasted 

My torment! 
38:9 Or is it, rather, that the treasures

Thus My punishment 

justly came to pass against them . 
38:15 Therefore, the likes of these disbelievers 

await nothing but a single blast of destruction , 

from which there shall be no recovery. 
38:16 Yet they say in mockery : Our Lord! 

Hasten our portion of doom for us now, 

before the Day of Reckoning! 
38:17 O Prophet! 

Be patient with all that they say. 

And recall Our servant David, a mere shepherd, 

whom God endowed with prowess. 

Indeed, he was ever-penitent. 
38:18 Indeed, We subjugated the very mountains 

to give due exaltation to God with him — 

in the evenings and at sunrise — 
38:19 and the birds in assembly, as well . 

Each would resort to Him in penitence . 
38:20 Thus did We strengthen his dominion. 

Moreover, We gave him prophetic wisdom 

and prudence in speech. 
38:2i -SfcNow, has the account of the two disputants 

come to you, O Prophet ? 

Behold! 

They climbed the wall of David's sanctuary. 
38:22 When they entered upon David during worship 
he was alarmed by them. 
They said: Have no fear! 
We are two disputants. 
One of us has committed injustice 
against the other. 
So judge between us, 
in accordance with the truth. 
Moreover, do not transgress the law of God .

But, rather, guide us to the even way. 
38:23 Indeed, this is my brother. 

He has ninety-nine ewes, 

whereas I have only one ewe. 

So he said: Give her into my care. 

Moreover, he became overbearing toward me 

in his speech. 
38:24 He said to the disputants : 

Truly, he has wronged you 

by asking to add your ewe to his ewes. 

And, indeed, many are the partners 

who commit injustice against one another, 

except for those who believe 

and do righteous deeds — and how few they are! 

Then David realized 

that We had put him to the test. 

So he sought forgiveness from his Lord, 

and, at once, he fell to bowing in worship 

and became penitent. 
38:25 So We forgave him this. 

And, indeed, there is, most surely, for him 

a station of nearness with Us 

in the Hereafter 

and a most excellent resort awaiting him. 
Thus did God exhort him: O David! 
Indeed, We have made you 
a successor in the land 
to sit upon the throne of Israel . 
So rule among the people 
in accordance with the revealed truth. 
Thus you shall not follow 
the dictates of whim,

38:27 For We have not created the heaven,

and all that is between them in vain. 
That is merely the conjecture 
of those who disbelieve. 
So woe to those who disbelieve, 
for they shall be cast into the Fire of Hell ! 
38:28 Or are We to make the reward 

of those who believe and do righteous deeds 

like that of those 

who sow corruption in the earth? 

Or are We to make the reward 

of the God-fearing like that of the wicked? 

38:29 A most blessed Book 

have We sent down to you, O Prophet, 
in this Quran, 

so that they who hear its tidings 
may reflect on its verses. 
And so that those who are endowed 
with discretion and understanding 
may heed its admonition 
and be ever mindful of its commandments . 
38:30 So to David We granted Solomon as a son — 
and a most commendable servant of God 
he was ! 

Indeed, he was ever-penitent. 
38:3i Behold! 

Once, in the late afternoon, 

purebred, prancing steeds 

were ranged for him to review,

Solomon offering the Prayer .

Return them to me. 

Thus he took to grooming them, in humility , 
stroking their legs 
and necks in gratefulness to God . 
38:34 And very truly, We put Solomon to the test 
when We cast upon his royal seat 
a mere body. 

Thereafter, he became ever-penitent.

And grant me an unrivaled kingdom 

such as never shall be possible 

for anyone after me to have . 

Indeed, it is You alone 

who are the All-Granting. 
38:36 Thus We subjugated to him the mighty wind, 

running smoothly at his command 

to wherever he directed. 
38:37 We subjugated to him , moreover, the satans — 

every able builder and diver among them . 
38:38 Also, We subjugated to him 

others among them coupled in fetters. 
38:39 So We said to him: 

This is Our gift. 

So confer and withhold from it, as you will , 
without reckoning from Us . 
38:40 And, indeed, there is, most surely, for him

39:1 The revelation of this Book 

is from God on high , 

the Overpowering One , the All- Wise. 
39:2 O Prophet! 

We have, indeed, sent down the Book to you 

with the very essence of all truth. 

So worship God and no other , 

making the practice of your religion 

pure and sincere to Him. 
39:3 For, most surely, it is to God alone 

that the true religion of purity belongs. 

For those who have taken patrons 

apart from Him say : 

We do not worship them for any other reason 
than that through their intercession 
they draw us nearer to God 
in spiritual station. 

Indeed, God will judge between them all 
about that which they dispute. 
Indeed, God does not guide 
one who is a liar and a relentless unbeliever.

He would, most surely, have chosen

from whatever He creates, 

not what they have said . 
Highly exalted is He far above this ! 
He alone is God, 
the One, the All-Dominating! 
39:5 He created the heavens 

and the earth with profound truth. 
He winds the night about the daylight. 
And He winds the daylight about the night. 
For He subjugated 
the sun and the moon 

to a fixed order , 

each one running its course 

for a stated term preordained by Him . 

Most surely, He alone 

is the Overpowering One , the Most Forgiving. 
39:6 He created all of you, O humankind, 
from a single soul. 
Then of it, He made its mate. 
Moreover, of cattle 

He has bestowed upon you eight types 
in four kinds, counting mates. 
He creates you in the wombs of your mothers — 
creation after creation — 
within three veils of darkness. 
That is God, your Lord! 
To Him alone belongs all the dominion. 
There is no God but Him. 
How, then, are you turned away 
from worshipping Him alone ? 
39:7 If you disbelieve — 
then let it be known 
that , indeed, God is self-sufficient 
without any need of you. 
Yet He is not pleased with unbelief

But if you give thanks, He is well pleased 

with this thanksgiving for you. 

Nor shall any sin-laden soul 

carry the sinful load of another. 

Then to your Lord alone is your return. 

Thus shall He tell you the due recompense 

of all that you have been doing in life . 

Indeed, He is all-knowing 

of all that is harbored 

within the breast of people . 

39:8 *)jfNow, when harm touches a human being, 

he calls upon his Lord for relief, 

penitent to Him alone . 

Then when He affords him 

a blessing of comfort from Him, 

he forgets that for which 

he was crying out to Him before, 

and he sets up rivals to God 

to lead others astray from His way. 

Say to such a one : 

Enjoy your unbelief 

for a little while, until death i 

For, indeed, you are to be 

of the Companions of the Fire of Hell! 
39:9 Is such a one better , 

or one who is devoutly obedient to God 

in the watches of the night, 

bowing his face down to the ground 

and standing in Prayer , 

fearing God's Judgment in the Hereafter 

and imploring the mercy of his Lord?

Are those who know God 

and those who do not know Him equal?

of the world — refusing to worship them —

the divine word of chastisement 

has already gone forth? 

Is it you, then, O Prophet, 

that shall rescue such a one 

who has lost his soul in the Fire? 
39:20 Yet for those who fear their Lord, 

there shall be in the Hereafter 

Heavenly Chambers, above which are built 

towering Heavenly Chambers, 

beneath which rivers flow. 

It is the promise of God —

God opens wide to receive Islam 
in willing submission to God alone, 
such that he follows a guiding light 
from his Lord, 

like one whose heart is closed ? 

Then woe to those whose hearts are hardened 

at the mention of God! 

They are utterly lost in clear misguidance.

as the fairest of all discourse. 

It is a Heavenly Book of cohering beauty, 

command, and consistency — oft-repeated. 

At the recitation of its forewarning, 

the very skins of those 

who venerate their Lord shiver. 

Then their skins and their hearts soften 

at the remembrance of God's 
glad tidings of Paradise . 

Such is the guidance of God! 

He guides with it whomever He so wills.

no guide shall there ever be for him.

Were God to intend any harm for me,

Or, were He to intend mercy for me,

39:42 It is God alone who takes the souls of people 

at the predestined time of their death. 

But as for those souls that have not yet died, 

He takes them during their sleep. 

Then He withholds the ones 

upon which He has decreed death, 

while He sends the others back 

to reach a stated term of life . 

Indeed, in all of this there are sure signs 

for a people who would reflect 

on life and death . 
39:43 Then shall they yet take to themselves 

false deities as intercessors apart from God? 

Say to them, O Prophet: 

Will they intercede for you even though 

they hold no authority over anything 

and understand nothing?

Intercession is altogether

were to have all that is in the earth —

they would, most surely, wish in vain

Rather, it is a trial,

is far greater than your abhorrence

Behold! 

You were in life called to faith 

by God's messengers . But you disbelieved.

Two times have You caused us to die. 

And two times have You caused us to live. 

We now confess our sins. 

Is there, then, any way for us 

to come out from eternal damnation? 
40:12 It shall be said: No! 

This torment you endure is because 

whenever God alone was invoked as One , 

you disbelieved in Him . 

Yet when associate-gods were ascribed to Him, 
you believed. 

Assuredly, all judgment belongs to God alone , 
the Ever-Exalted, the All-Great.

who shows you His wondrous signs

Yet, indeed, none is mindful of this , 

but one who turns to Him in penitence. 
40:14 Therefore, O believers, 

call upon God and no other , 

making the practice of your religion 

pure and sincere to Him alone — 

even if the disbelievers hate it. 
40:15 He alone is the All-Elevated of every lofty rank 

above His creation — 

Sole Possessor of the Throne! 

He casts the spirit of the divine Law 

through His revealed commandments 

upon whomever He so wills 

of His servants chosen as messengers , 

to forewarn all people 

of the inevitable Day of His Meeting — 
40:16 the Day they shall all come forward 

for Judgment before God , 

nothing of them hidden from God. 

Then shall it be asked: 

To whom 

does all the dominion belong this Day? 

To God, the One, the All-Dominating! 
40:17 This Day, each soul shall be recompensed 

for all that it has earned in life . 

No injustice is there this Day. 

Indeed, God is swift in reckoning. 
40:18 So forewarn them of the Impending Day 

when hearts go up into choking throats — 

when there shall be no intimate friend 

for the wrongdoers, nor any intercessor

They were far greater than them in power —

Such is the mighty decree

so that We might cause them to taste 

something of the divine torment of disgrace

then seek refuge in God. 

Indeed, it is He 

who is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. 

4i:37 Now of His wondrous signs

You shall not bow yourselves down

But you shall bow yourselves down

41:38 But if they who worship false gods

4i:4i Indeed, those who have disbelieved 

in the Remembrance of this Quran 

when it came to them have lost their souls,

For, indeed, it is, most surely,

4i:42 No falsehood can reach it or repeal it

neither before it nor ever after it. 

It is a revelation sent down

moreover, it is a pall of blindness 

cast over them, 

as though they are being called 
from a bewilderingly far-off place.

But, indeed, they remain 
in much-perplexed doubt about it. 

4i:46 Anyone who does a righteous deed in life 

does it purely for the good of his own soul. 
And anyone who does an evil deed 
does it only in detriment against it. 
For never does your Lord 
wrong His servants in the least .

Such is God,

Indeed, it is God

and thereby to forewarn all of humanity

42:8 Had God so willed,

no path to salvation is there for him. 
42:47 Therefore, answer the call of your Lord, 

O disbelievers, before there comes 

a Day of Reckoning from God 

that cannot be turned back. 

On that Day, you shall not have any refuge, 

nor shall you have 

any grounds for denial of your sins . 
42:48 Yet if they turn away from God's call, 
O Prophet, 

then know that We have not sent you 

to be a keeper over them. 

For nothing is incumbent upon you 

but the clear conveyance of His message. 

So do not grieve over their rejection. 

For when We cause the human being 

to taste blessings out of mercy from Us, 

he rejoices because of it. 

But if an affliction touches any of them — 

because of the evil 

that their own hands have advanced — 
then, indeed, the human being

Never before it did you know 

what the Book of God was, 

nor what Heavenly faith was .

43:9 Now, were you to ask them: 
Who is it 

that has created the heavens and the earth? 

They would, most surely, say: 

The Overpowering One , the All-Knowing 

has created them. 
Say to them: 
43:io He alone 

has made the earth a cradle for you 

and placed therein roadways for you, 

so that you may be guided through it . 
43:i l And He alone 

has sent down, from the sky, water 

in due measure — 

then it is We alone 

who revive with it a lifeless land! 

Even so shall you all be brought forth 

after you die . 
43:12 And He alone has created all things in pairs 

and made for you as means of transport — 

ships and cattle, upon which you ride, 
43:13 so that you may settle yourselves 

upon their backs, 

such that you remember 

the grace of your Lord 

when you settle upon them, and say: 

Highly exalted is the One 

who has subjugated this to us! 

For never were we ourselves

43:14 And, indeed, to our Lord 

we are, most surely, returning. 

43:15 Yet they who disbelieve 

have instead ascribed to Him, 

from His own servants, 

a constituency of goddesses . 

Indeed, the human being 

is openly an unbelieving ingrate. 
43:16 Is it, then, that He has taken for Himself 

the angels as divine daughters — 

from all that H e has created — 

while favoring you with sons? 
43:17 Yet whenever any of them 

who belie you, O Prophet, 

is given the glad tidings of a female child — 

the like of which he ascribes 

to the All-Merciful as an associate-god — 

his very face grows dark, for in his ignorance 

he is filled with suppressed rage. 
43:18 Then is one reared amid ornaments, 

and obscure in the midst of conflict, 

to be God's offspring ? 
43:19 Moreover, they render the angels — 

who are themselves but servants 

of the All-Merciful — females! 

Did they witness their creation? 

Their false witness shall be written! 

And they shall be questioned about it 

on Judgment Day ! 
43:20 Moreover, they say:

before this Quran 

to which they now hold firm? 
43:22 Rather, they say: 

Indeed, we found our forefathers 

adhering to a certain religion. 

And upon their traces, 

we ourselves shall be guided. 
43:23 And so it is, O Prophet, 

that We have never sent before you 

a forewarner to any community, 

without its affluent saying: 

Indeed, we found our forefathers 

adhering to a certain religion. 

And upon their traces, 

we ourselves shall follow. 
43:24 Thus each messenger said: 

Will you continue thereupon 

even if I bring you to a more guided way

your forefathers adhering? 

Always , they said: 

Indeed, we are disbelievers in all that you claim 
to have been sent with from God . 
43:25 Thus We took vengeance on them. 
So see how devastating was the end 
of those who belied God's words 
and messengers . 

43:26 Thus behold!

43:29 Yet, indeed, I let these disbelievers 

and their forefathers enjoy life,

elucidating My commandments . 
43:30 But when the revealed truth came to them

to a man of greatness 

from either of the two leading Arabian cities, 

we could be sure of its truth ! 
43:32 Are they the ones, then, 

who apportion the mercy of your Lord, 

O Prophet ? 
Rather, it is We alone 
who apportion among them 

even their very livelihood 
in the life of this world. 
Moreover, it is We alone 
who have raised some of them 
above others, by degrees,

would, therefore, become one community

43:46 For very truly, We sent Moses 

with Our miraculous signs to Pharaoh 

and to his assembly of nobles. 

Thus he said to them : 

Indeed, I am the messenger 

of the Lord of All the Worlds. 
43:47 But when he came to them 

with Our miraculous signs, 

behold, they laughed at them. 
43:48 And not a sign did We show them 

but that it was greater than its predecessor. 

Thus We seized them 

with torment after torment , 

so that they might return to belief in One God . 
43:49 And they repeatedly said to Moses : 

O learned sorcerer! 

Call upon your Lord for us to relieve us 

by virtue of what He has covenanted with you. 

Indeed, we shall then, most surely, 

be rightly guided. 
43:50 But whenever We removed 

any of the torment from them, 

at once they would breach their promise . 
43:5i Then Pharaoh called out among his people. 

He said: O my people!

and that these very rivers 

flow from beneath me? 

Do you not see?

marshaled together with him? 
4354 And so it was that he incited his people 

to belie the miracles of Moses . 

And they obeyed him. 

Indeed, they were an ungodly people. 
43:55 Thus when they displeased Us, 

We took vengeance on them. 

So We drowned them, all together. 
43:56 And We made them a precedent and an example 

for the latter generations. 

43:57 SfcNow, when Jesus , the son of Mary, 

was likened by the Makkans to their idols — 
as an exemplar of something worshipped 
apart from God, 

all of which the Quran condemned to Hell — 
at once your people, O Prophet, 
clamored with boisterous joy because of it, 
43:58 wherefore they said in derision : 
Shall our gods, in the Hereafter, 
be placed in as excellent a standing as he is? 
They did not put this forth 
but for the purpose of devious argumentation. 
For, indeed, 

they are an utterly contentious people. 
43:59 As for Jesus, he, like his mother Mary, 

is not but a servant of God 

upon whom We have bestowed grace. 

Thus We made him a miraculous exemplar 

for the Children of Israel.

So have no doubt in this! 

Thus say to them, O Prophet : Follow me. 

This is a straight way to salvation . 
43:62 Therefore, do not let Satan 

turn you aside from it . 

Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy. 
43:63 Indeed, when Jesus came to his people 

with clear and miraculous proofs 

confirming his truth , 

he said the very same as this Prophet : 

Truly, I have come to you 

with prophetic wisdom, 

and to make clear to you 

some of that about which you dispute 

in your religion . 

So fear God! And obey me! 
43:64 Indeed, God is my Lord and your Lord. 

So worship Him alone . 

This is a straight way to salvation .

the sects disputed about him among themselves. 

So woe to those who do wrong 

by worshipping him 

from the torment of a painful Day Hereafter ! 

43:66 Do they who disbelieve 

await other than the Hour of Doom ,

who has subjugated for ail of you the sea,

45:13 And He has subjugated for you 

all that is in the heavens 

and all that is in the earth — 

all of it from Him and no other ! 

Indeed, in this 

there are sure signs of God's Oneness 

for a people who would reflect 
on the wonder of creation . 
45:14 Say, O Prophet, to those who believe, 

that they should forgive the wrong 

done to them by those 

who have no hope of reward or salvation 

in the looming Days of God, 

whereupon He duly recompenses a people 

for all that they have earned in life . 
45:15 Anyone who does a righteous deed in life 

does it purely for the good of his own soul. 

And anyone who does an evil deed 

does it only in detriment against it.

with all that is wholesome in life . 

Thus had We shown them preference 

above the peoples of their time in all the world. 
45:17 Moreover, We gave them clear proofs 

of Our divine commandments. 

Thus they did not dispute among themselves 

regarding the true religion , 

until after revealed knowledge 
of the Scripture had come to them 
on the tongues of the messengers, 

and some belied them — 

thereby exceeding the due bounds of God 

with one another — 
out of nothing but insolence and envy . 

Indeed, your Lord shall judge between them all 

on the Day of Resurrection as to that wherein 

they have been disputing. 
45:18 Then, after Moses , 

We have set you, O Prophet, 

upon the straight course of a Divine Law. 

Thus shall you follow it. 

And you shall not follow the whims 

of those who do not know the truth . 
45:19 Indeed, they would not avail you in that case 

against the judgment of God in the least. 

For the wrongdoers who are godless in heart 

are but patrons of one another. 

Yet it is God who is the Patron 

of the God-fearing. 
45:20 This Quran is a manifest proof of God's truth 

for all people — 

and divine guidance, 

and a sure way to God's mercy, 

for a people who have certainty of faith .

So very grievous is the judgment they make! 
45:22 For it is God alone 

who has created the heavens and the earth 

with the very essence of all truth, 

to recompense each soul 

with all that it has earned in life . 

And never shall they be wronged in the least . 
45:23 Have you, then, seen such a one 

as rejects God's guidance 

and makes his own desire his god? 

Thus does God lead one astray, 

despite the clear authority 

of the revealed knowledge He offered him . 

Therefore, He has set a seal 

upon his hearing and his heart, 

and placed over his eyes a veil. 

Who, then, shall guide one 

after God has sealed his fate ? 

Will you not, then, become mindful, O people, 

of God's commandments ? 
45:24 Moreover, they who reject resurrection 

have said: 

There is nothing but our life in this world: 
We die once . And we live once . 
Therefore, nothing destroys us 
but the passage of time. 
Yet about this, they have no sure knowledge. 
Indeed, they do nothing but conjecture. 
45:25 Thus when Our revealed verses 
are recited to them 
as clear evidence of the life to come , 
their only argument is to say: 
Then bring our forefathers back to life ,

It is God alone who gives you life.

There is no doubt about this. 

But most people do not know

over the heavens and the earth. 

Thus the Day the Hour of Doom

This Day you shall be recompensed 

for all that you used to do in the world . 

45:29 This is Our Preserved Book of Record!

Hence, your eternal abode is the Fire of Hell . 
And for the likes of you,

For the life of the world utterly deluded you. 

Therefore, as of this Day, 

they are consigned to the Fire of Hell

47:25 Indeed, those hypocrites 

who have turned their backs on God 

after the revealed guidance 

has been made clear to them, 

it is only Satan that has tempted them 

and prolonged worldly hope for them. 

47:26 That is because they said with conviction 
to those among the unbelievers 
who abhor what God has sent down: 
We will obey you by withholding ourselves 
in the matter of fighting . 
For God knows all their secrets. 

47:27 So how shall it be 

when the angels take their souls at death , 
striking their faces and their backs? 

47:28 That is because they have followed 
what brings down upon them 
the wrath of God. 

For they have abhorred His good pleasure. 

Thus He has rendered utterly futile 

all their works. 
47:29 Or did those 

in whose doubting hearts there is a sickness 

really think that God 

would never expose their ill will? 
4730 Yet had We so willed, 

We would have shown them to you, 

O Prophet, manifestly, 

so that you would recognize them 

by their indelible mark — 

or so that you would clearly recognize them 

by their permanently twisted speech. 

For God knows the deeds of all of you.

We shall, moreover, test the merit 
of all that you say and do. 
47:32 Indeed, those who disbelieve 

and who bar people from the path of God 
and who rebel against the Messenger — 
after the revealed guidance of God 
has been made clear to them — 
shall never harm God in anything. 
But He shall render all their works

47:35 Therefore, do not become fainthearted 

and sue for peace 

when just struggle is imperative . 

For you shall be the uppermost. 

For God is with you,

the reward of your deeds.

those who think evil thoughts about God. 

Upon them shall befall 

a turn of great misfortune.

And never will you find, O Prophet,

3:24 For He is the One 

who pacified the disbelievers

from the Sacred Mosque at Makkah , 
and who barred the charitable-offering 
of sacrifice, 

which was detained so that it did not reach 
its designated place of sacrifice. 
And were it not for some believing men

whom you did not know to be believers

bowing themselves in worship ,

Their marks are upon their faces 

from the traces of bowing their faces down

That is their likeness, as described in the Torah. 

And their likeness in the Evangel 

is as a seed which puts forth its shoot,

As to those who call out to you,

good manners and civility . 
For were they to remain patient 
until you were to come out to them 

of your own accord , 
it would be better for them. 
Yet God is all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 



O you who believe! 
If an ungodly person comes to you 
with any news, be discerning, 
so as not to afflict a people out of ignorance, 
and thereafter become regretful 
about what you have done. 
Moreover, know that in your midst 
is the Messenger of God. 
Were he to follow the inclinations 
you express in most matters, 
you would, most surely, become overburdened 
with hardships . 

However, God has endeared faith to you 
and adorned it in your hearts. 
Thus He has made unbelief hateful to you, 
as well as ungodliness and disobedience. 
It is these who are the rightly guided. 
This is a bounty from God and a blessing. 
For God is all-knowing, all- wise. 
49:9 Yet if ever two groups of the believers

49:io Indeed, all the believers are brethren. 
Thus set aright relations

50:37 Indeed, in this Quran, 

there is, most surely, a reminder 
for whoever has a living heart 
or lends an attentive ear, 
with full presence of mind . 

50:38 Now very truly, it is We alone 

who have created the heavens and the earth, 

and all that is between them, 

in a span of six Heavenly days — 

and never were We touched 

with any weariness! 
50:39 Therefore, be patient, O Prophet, 

with what they say. 

Moreover, highly exalt your Lord 

with all praise 

before the rising of the sun 

and before its setting. 
50:40 And during part of the night, 

exalt Him, as well, 

and also after you bow your face down 
to the ground in your Prayers . 
50:4i And listen well for the Day, O Prophet, 

that the caller to Judgment 

shall call people forth from their graves, 

from a place so very near them — 
50:42 a Day they shall hear 

the Trumpet Blast of Resurrection 

with undeniable truth. 

That shall be the Day of Emergence. 
50:43 Indeed, it is We alone 

who give life and give death. 

Thus to Us alone is the ultimate destiny.

The Last Hour has drawn near! 

And the moon has split apart! 

But even when these disbelievers 

see a miraculous sign, 

they turn away and say: Fleeting sorcery! 

So they have belied the truth 

and followed their whims. 

Yet every affair shall be settled. 

And sufficient tidings, 

wherein there is a grave threat, 

have already come to them 

in the revealed verses 

of an all-reaching wisdom. 

Yet the forewarnings do not avail them . 

So turn away 

from the disbelievers among them, 
O Prophet . 

A Day is coming when the Angel -Summoner 

shall summon them to an event 

that is utterly horrendous. 

Their eyes downcast, 

they shall issue forth from the tombs 

as if they were swarming locusts,

The disbelievers shall say: 
This is an exceedingly harsh Day! 

54:9 -^Before those of them 

who now belie you, O Prophet, 

the people of Noah belied the truth . 

Thus they belied Our servant Noah 

and said of him: A sheer madman! 

And he was gravely threatened. 
54:io So he called upon his Lord, praying : 

I am utterly overpowered. So help me. 
54:ii Thus We opened wide the gates of the sky, 

with water pouring down in torrents. 
54:12 And We caused the earth to burst forth 

with gushing fountains. 

Thus the waters of sky and earth met 

upon a matter predetermined. 
54:13 And We carried him upon 

a vessel of planks and nails, 
54:14 running under the care 

of Our watchful Eyes — 

a reward for he who was belied. 
54:15 Then We left it as a sign. 

So is there anyone to remember?

In that case, we would, indeed, be utterly lost 

in misguidance and raving madness. 
54:25 Has the message of God 

been cast upon him alone 

from among all of us? 

Rather, he is a sheer liar, 

a mere boaster. 
54:26 God revealed to His messenger: 

They shall know tomorrow 

who is the sheer liar, the mere boaster. 
54:27 Indeed, We shall send 

the miraculous she-camel 

to them as a sign for you 

and a means of trial for them . 

So watch them and have utmost patience. 
54:28 Moreover, tell them that their watering place 

is to be shared between them

We delivered them at night's end,

Thus do We reward one who gives thanks. 
54:36 For very truly, 

he had forewarned them of Our assault, 

but they doubted the forewarnings. 
54:37 Yet even his guests 

did they wickedly solicit of him! 

Thus We blotted out their eyes

Not equal among yourselves

Those who did are greater in rank

Wait for us, that we may borrow 
from your light! 

It shall be said in mockery of them : 

Return back to retrieve the faith 

you left behind you in the world, 

and seek for yourselves light! 

Thereupon a wall that has a door

Within its interior, there is all mercy. 

But in front of its outward side, 

there is only torment. 
57:14 The hypocrites shall cry out to the believers : 

Were we not with you in life ? 

They shall say: Oh yes, indeed! 

But you tempted your own souls to duplicity . 

And with eager anticipation 

you awaited our demise . 

For you doubted faith and this Resurrection . 

For worldly fancies deluded you —

and an arena of vying in wealth 
and in children. 

Its parable is that of a nourishing rainfall, 

the herbage from which 

pleases the tillers of soil. 

But then it dries up, 

so that you see it turning yellow. 

Then it becomes crumbling stubble. 

Even so shall there be in the Hereafter 

severe torment, 

as well as the forgiveness of God 
and His good pleasure. 
For the life of this world is nothing 
but the mere enjoyment of a delusion. 
57:21 Race one another 

to the forgiveness of your Lord — 

and to a Garden of Paradise , 

whose breadth is as the breadth 

of all heaven and earth, 

prepared for those who believe in God 

and in His messengers. 

That is the bounty of God. 

He gives it to whomever He so wills. 

For God alone 

is the Possessor of Magnificent Bounty. 
57:22 Not a single affliction befalls in the earth, 
or among yourselves, 
or a blessing, but it is already written 
in a Book preserved in Heaven 
before We create it to try you . 
Indeed, that for God is ever so easy.

and enjoin miserliness on people. 

Thus whoever turns away 
from giving in God's cause — 

then know that , indeed, 

it is God alone 

who is the Self-Sufficient One , the All-Praised. 
57:25 Very truly, We have sent Our messengers 

to humanity with clear and miraculous proofs 

that confirmed their messages . 
And We sent down with each of them 
a Heavenly Book to guide their people , 
along with the just balance, 
so that people might establish justice

Moreover, We sent down iron 

from the heavens , 

in which there is mighty force, 

and in which there are many benefits 

for all people; 

and so also that God might make known 
who supports Him and His messengers, 
though unseen. 

Indeed, God alone is all-powerful,

57:26 So very truly, We did, indeed, 

send Noah and Abraham as messengers . 

Thus We placed prophethood and the Scripture 

among their seed. 

So some of them were rightly guided.

And We followed them up with Jesus, 

son of Mary. 

So We gave him the Evangel 
as a Heavenly Book . 
And We placed in the hearts 
of those who followed him 
loving-kindness and mercy. 
But as for the tradition of monasticism — 
they themselves invented it. 
Never did We prescribe it for them, 
but only that they seek the pleasure of God. 
Yet they did not observe this ordinance 
with its rightfully due observance. 
So We gave those who believed among them 
their reward. 

But many of them were ungodly.

And believe in His Messenger! 

He shall then give you

Thus He shall forgive you. 

For God is all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 
57:29 So it is that the People of the Scripture 

may know, indeed, that they have no power 

over anything of God's bounty; 

and that, indeed, 

all bounty is in the Hand of God alone . 
He gives it to whomever He so wills.

Truly, God has heard the words

For God hears your discourse with each other. 

Indeed, God is all-hearing, all-seeing.

You are prohibited to me for marital relations

None are their mothers 

other than those who gave birth to them. 

Therefore, indeed, they are assuredly uttering

then he shall instead fast

Moreover, when they come to you,

IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE ALL-MERCIFUL, THE MERCY-GIVING 



66:1 O Prophet! 

Why do you prohibit yourself from what God 

has made lawful for you, 

in order to attain the good pleasure 

of your wives? 

Yet God is all-forgiving, mercy-giving. 
66:2 God has already sanctioned 

a way for you believers to absolve yourselves 

from your oaths. 

God alone is your Patron — 

and He is the All-Knowing, the All- Wise. 
66:3 Behold! 

The Prophet confided 

a matter to one of his wives. 

Then when she told another of his wives of it, 

and God acquainted him with it, 

the Prophet made known part of it to her 

and avoided disclosing a part. 

Then when he disclosed to her 

what she had divulged , she said: 

Who told you this? 

He said: 

The One who is All-Knowing, All-Aware

SURAH 66 I AL-TAHRIM - THE PROHIBITION 



has told me. 

66:4 God said: 

If you two wives turn in repentance to God, 

it will be accepted , 

for your hearts have truly inclined 

to an aberration. 

But if you support one another against him, 
then God, Himself, 
is, indeed, his protector — 
as well as Gabriel, and every righteous believer. 
And the other angels, moreover, 
are his supporters. 
66:5 It may be that his Lord — 

should he divorce all of you wives — 
shall give to him, instead of you, 
wives who are better than you: 
Submitting themselves willingly to God! 
Believing women! 
Devoutly obedient women! 
Penitent women! 
Worshipful women! 
Godly Emigres, 

both of the formerly wedded and virgins. 

66:6 O you who believe! 

Save yourselves and your families from a Fire 

whose fuel is people and stones, 

over which are designated angels, 

dreadfully stern and severe. 

They do not disobey God 

in whatever He commands them. 

Indeed, they do 

whatever they are commanded.

O you who disbelieve! 

Make no excuses this Day. 

Indeed, you are only being recompensed 

for all the evil that you have done in life . 

O you who believe! 

Repent to God with a most sincere repentance. 

Perhaps your Lord will absolve you 

of your misdeeds and admit you into Gardens 

beneath which rivers flow — 

on a Day Hereafter, 

when God will not disgrace the Prophet 

or those who have believed with him. 

Their light shall stream forth before them, 

and to their right. 

They shall say: Our Lord! 

Perfect for us our light, and forgive us. 

Indeed, it is You 

who are powerful over all things. 



O Prophet! 

Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, 
and be stern with them. 
For their abode is Hell — 
and a most woeful destination it is! 
66:io God sets forth, 

as an example for those who disbelieve, 

the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. 

They were under the care 

of two of Our righteous servants, 

but they forsook the faith of their husbands, 

and thus betrayed them. 

So even as prophets, 

they could not avail either of them

the wife of Pharaoh. 

Behold, she said: My Lord! 

Build for me near You 

a house in the Garden of Paradise . 

And deliver me from Pharaoh 

and his evil doing. 

And deliver me from the wrongdoing people 
who are godless in heart .

who estimably safeguarded her chastity. 
Then We breathed into her womb

in mocking crowds? 

70:38 Is it that every one of them 
hopes to be admitted 
to an everlasting Garden of Delight

70:39 No, indeed! 

We have but created them

I do swear by the Lord 

of all the Easts and all the Wests 

that truly We are all-able

Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, saying : 
Forewarn your people

before there comes to them 
a most painful torment. 
He said: O my people! 
I am, indeed, a clear forewarner 

sent by God to you, 
that you shall worship God alone 
and fear Him, and obey me. 
He shall forgive you of your sins, 
and defer judgment upon you 
until you fulfill a stated term of life . 
Indeed, God's term of judgment — 
when it comes as punishment 
for ungodliness — cannot be deferred; 
if only you knew this, 
you would surely believe .

Indeed, whenever I called them 
to worship You alone , 
so that You might forgive them, 
they put their fingers in their ears 
and covered themselves with their garments, 
and belligerently persisted in unbelief, 
and became arrogant — so very arrogant! 
Then I called them all to belief in public. 
Then I made known my message 
to some of them openly , 
while I secretly 

called to others among them in private. 
Then I said to them : 
Seek forgiveness from your Lord. 
Indeed, ever is He most forgiving.

Do not ever leave your gods! 

Do not ever leave Wadd,

Therefore, my Lord, do not give increase

7i:25 So they were drowned for their sinfulness 

then committed to a blazing Fire. 

Nor did they find for themselves, 

apart from God, 

any supporters against His Judgment .

Do not leave upon the earth a single dweller

IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE ALL-MERCIFUL, THE MERCY-GIVING 



72:i Say, O Prophet : 

It has been revealed to me 

that a group of jinn has listened 

to me reciting the Quran . 

So they said in admonition to their fellowship : 

Indeed, we have heard a wondrous Quran. 
72:2 It guides to the right way. 

So we have believed in it. 

Thus, never shall we associate 

anyone as a god with our Lord. 
72:3 For, indeed, 

most high is the majesty of our Lord. 

He has not taken a spouse nor begotten a son. 
72:4 Thus, indeed, the foolish among us 

have spoken an outrage against God 

in saying this . 
72:5 And, indeed, we had thought 

that humankind and jinn 

would never speak lies against God. 
72:6 Yet, indeed, there have been men 

among humankind 

who seek refuge in the males of the jinn. 
But they of the jinn who men seek out

have only increased them in degradation 
by urging them to impiety . 
72:7 For, indeed, they of the jinn 
have thought, 

as you human beings have thought — 
that God would never raise up anyone 
after death for Judgment . 

72.8 Now, indeed, we of the jinn 

have sought to reach into Heaven. 

But we found it filled 

with mighty angels as guards 

and shooting flames. 
72:9 For, indeed, before the Quran's revelation, 

we used to sit 

in some of the sitting places near there 

to listen to the higher world . 

But one who seeks to listen now 

finds a shooting flame in wait for him. 
72:io So, indeed, we do not know 

whether an evil recompense is intended 

for all those in the earth, 

or whether their Lord intends 

to bring about for them right guidance. 
72:ii Now, indeed, among us 

are those who are righteous. 

And among us are those who are other than this. 

We jinn have become of divergent ways. 
72:12 Yet, indeed, we ourselves have realized 

that never can we thwart 

the will of God on earth. 

Nor shall we ever thwart Him 

by way of escape. 
72:13 For, indeed, when we heard 

the guidance of the Quran , we believed in it.

Thus whoever believes in his Lord in this life 
shall fear neither deprivation 
of his reward in the Hereafter 
nor degradation by an unjust accounting . 
72:14 And, indeed, among us 
are those who are muslims, 
in willing submission to God alone . 
And among us are those who are iniquitous. 
So as to those 

who have willingly submitted themselves 
to God alone , 

they have pursued the right way 
to everlasting delight near their Lord . 
72:15 But as for the iniquitous, 

they shall be firewood for Hell. 

72:i6 God says: 

And were they who have belied this message 
to keep straight on the path of God , 
We would, most surely, 
quench their thirst 

and give them water from the heavens 
to drink in abundance — 
72:17 so as to test them with it! 
Yet whoever turns away 
from the remembrance of his Lord, 
He shall thrust him 
into ever-mounting torment. 



72:18 Now, indeed, the places of worship 
are solely for God. 

So do not call upon anyone in worship 
along with God. 
72:19 Yet when Muhammad, the servant of God, 

stood before his Lord invoking Him in Prayer ,

SURAH 72 I AL-JINN - JINN-KIND 



they who disbelieve 

were nearly swarming over him to harm him . 
72:20 Say, O Prophet : 

I call only upon my Lord in worship . 

Nor do I associate anyone as a god with Him. 
72:21 Say, also : 

Indeed, I hold no power 

with regard to you who belie me — 

neither to bring you harm, 

nor to compel you to right guidance. 
72:22 Moreover , say: 

Indeed, if ever I were to disobey Him 

never could anyone protect me from God — 

for never shall I find 

a place of refuge, apart from Him. 
72:23 Mine is only to convey the truth from God 

and to deliver His messages to one and all . 

Yet as to one who disobeys God 

and His Messenger, 

indeed, for him there is the Fire of Hell 
awaiting in the Hereafter — 

to abide therein, forever and ever. 
72:24 At last, when they who disbelieve 

see all the suffering 

that they have been promised, 

they will know, then, with certainty 

who has weaker supporters 

and is fewer in number. 
72:25 Say, O Prophet : 

I do not know whether the fulfillment 

of what you are promised 

as divine judgment is near, 

or if my Lord will defer it for a long while. 
72:26 He is the Sole Knower 

of the realm of the unseen.

And never does He manifest

with whom He is well pleased. 

Then, indeed, He dispatches before such a one, 

and behind him, angel- sentinels, 
72:28 so that He may know with proof 

whether they who are His messengers 

have conveyed the messages of their Lord — 

though He Himself 

encompasses all that is with them; 

and He Himself 

has enumerated all things by number.

So read of it in your Prayers 
so much as may be easy. 
Yet you shall duly establish the Prayer. 
And you shall give the Zakat-Charity, 
and thereby lend God a most goodly loan. 
For whatever good you advance for your souls, 
you shall find its reward with God 
in the Hereafter; 
yet it shall be far better 
and much greater in reward. 
Thus seek, all of you, God's forgiveness.

Has it ever occurred to man 

that there were eons in the course of time 

when he was nothing even to be mentioned? 

Indeed, it is We alone who have created man 

from a sperm-drop of mingled fluid 

to try him in life . 

Thus did We make him 

a being endowed with hearing and seeing. 

Indeed, it is We alone 

who have shown him the way 

to be either thankful or ungrateful. 

Indeed, it is We alone 

who have prepared for the disbelievers 

chains, and yokes, and a flaming Fire in Hell . 

As to the virtuous, they shall, in the Hereafter , 

drink from a chalice of a wine, 

tinged with a mixture of camphor, 

flowing from a spring 

from which the worthy servants of God alone 
shall drink — 

and which they themselves shall cause to gush, 

at their command, in fountains. 

Such is for those who fulfill their vows,

and who fear a Day whose evil is on the wing, 

flying far and wide. 
76:8 Thus they feed with food — 

despite their own desire for it — 

the indigent, and the orphan, 

and the captive of war, saying : 
76:9 We feed you purely for the sake of God. 

We desire no reward from you, 

nor thankfulness. 
76:io Indeed, we have fear of our Lord 

and His punishment , on a Day Hereafter, 

when faces shall be overspread with frowns 

and intense gloom. 
76:ii So God will shield them 

against the evil of that Day 

and will confer upon them radiance 

and great gladness. 
76:12 And He will reward them for their patience 

with a Garden of Paradise and clothing of silk. 
76:13 They shall recline therein on canopied couches. 

They see therein 

neither blazing sun nor bitter cold. 
76:14 Moreover, so very near above them 

are its boughs of shade — 

their fruit-clusters lowered close in easy reach. 
76:15 Passed round among them are vessels of silver 

and cups bright as crystal — 
76:16 crystalline of silver — 

that they measure out with perfect measure. 
76:17 They are given to drink of a chalice of wine 

tinged with a mixture of ginger, 
76:18 from a fountain therein that is named Salsabil. 
76:19 £j£ Going round serving them 

are immortal youths. 

If you see them,

you shall think them to be strewn pearls. 
76:20 And wherever you so look, 

there shall you see pure delight 

and a great kingdom. 
76:2i Enrobing the Heavenly inhabitants 

shall be green raiments 

of sarcenet and rich brocade. 

And they shall be adorned therein 

with bracelets of silver. 

Thus their Lord 

shall give them to drink a pure drink. 
76:22 It shall be said: 

Indeed, all this is for you in reward! 

For your lifetime of striving 

has been graciously accepted. 
76:23 O Prophet! 

Indeed, it is We 

who have sent down the Quran to you 
in a succession of revelations . 
76:24 So be patient, O Prophet, 
with your Lord's decree 
to convey His message . 
Nor shall you obey the dictates 
of any one among them 

who is utterly sinful or an unbelieving ingrate. 
76:25 But remember with praise 
the name of your Lord 

in the early morning, and in the late afternoon, 
76:26 and for a good part of the night. 

Therefore, bow down before Him in Prayer . 

And highly exalt Him at length in the night. 
76:27 Indeed, these disbelievers do love 

the fleeting pleasures of the world . 

Thus they leave behind them 

a very weighty Day in the Hereafter .

And if We so will, 

We can replace them, and their likes, entirely. 
76:29 Indeed, these verses of admonition 

are revealed as a Reminder of that Day — 

so that whoever so wills 

may take to his Lord 

a penitent way to salvation . 
76:30 Nor do you human beings will anything , 

except that God so wills. 

Indeed, God is ever all-knowing, all-wise. 
76:3i He admits into His mercy 

whomever He so wills. 

Yet as to the wrongdoers, 

He has prepared for them 

a most painful torment.

take it in full;

when he belies the truth and turns away?

Most surely, if he does not desist, 

We shall, certainly, seize him by the forelock —

96:17 Then let him call upon his council! 
96:18 We shall call upon the Guards of Hell!
