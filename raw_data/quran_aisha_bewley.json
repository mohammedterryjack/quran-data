    "2:50": "And when We parted the sea for you and rescued you, and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you watched.",
    "2:51": "And when We allotted to Musa forty nights. Then you adopted the Calf when he had gone and you were wrongdoers.",
    "2:52": "Then We pardoned you after that so that perhaps you would show thanks.",
    "2:53": "Remember when We gave Musa the Book and discrimination so that perhaps you would be guided.",
    "2:54": "And when Musa said to his people, 'My people, You wronged yourselves by adopting the Calf so turn towards your Maker and kill yourselves. That is the best thing for you in your Maker's sight.' And He turned towards you. He is the Ever-Returning, the Most Merciful.",
    "2:55": "And when you said, 'Musa, we will not believe in you until we see Allah with our own eyes.' So the thunder-bolt struck you dead while you were looking.",
    "2:56": "Then We brought you back to life after your death, so that perhaps you would show thanks.",
    "2:57": "And We shaded you with clouds and sent down manna and quails to you: 'Eat of the good things We have provided for you.' They did not wrong Us; rather it was themselves they were wronging.",
    "2:58": "Remember when We said, 'Go into this town, and eat from it wherever you like, freely. Enter the gate prostrating and say, \"Relieve us of our burdens!\" Your mistakes will be forgiven. We will grant increase to all good-doers.'",
    "2:59": "But those who did wrong substituted words other than those they had been given. So We sent down a plague from heaven on those who did wrong because they were deviators.",
    "2:60": "And when Musa was looking for water for his people, We said, 'Strike the rock with your staff.' Then twelve fountains gushed out from it and all the people knew their drinking place. 'Eat and drink of Allah's provision and do not go about the earth corrupting it.'",
    "2:61": "And when you said, 'Musa, we will not put up with just one kind of food so ask your Lord to supply to us some of what the earth produces - its green vegetables, cucumbers, grains, lentils and onions,' he said, 'Do you want to replace what is better with what is inferior? Go back to Egypt, then you will have what you are asking for.' Abasement and destitution were stamped upon them. They brought down anger from Allah upon themselves. That was because they rejected Allah's Signs and killed the Prophets without any right to do so. That was because they rebelled and went beyond the limits.",
    "2:62": "Those with iman, those who are Jews, and the Christians and Sabaeans, all who have iman in Allah and the Last Day and act rightly, will have their reward with their Lord. They will feel no fear and will know no sorrow.",
    "2:63": "Remember when We made the covenant with you and lifted up the Mount above your heads: 'Take hold vigorously of what We have given you and pay heed to what is in it, so that hopefully you will have taqwa.'",
    "2:64": "Then after that you turned away, and were it not for Allah's favour to you and His mercy, you would have been among the lost.",
    "2:65": "You are well aware of those of you who broke the Sabbath. We said to them, 'Be apes, despised, cast out.'",
    "2:66": "We made it an exemplary punishment for those there then, and those coming afterwards, and a warning to those who have taqwa.",
    "2:67": "And when Musa said to his people, 'Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow,' they said, 'What! Are you",
    "2:68": "They said, 'Ask your Lord to make it clear to us what it should be like.' He said, 'He says it should be a cow, not old or virgin, but somewhere between the two. So do as you have been told.'",
    "2:69": "They said, 'Ask your Lord to make it clear to us what colour it should be.' He said, 'He says it should be a red cow, the colour of sorrel, a pleasure to all who look.'",
    "2:70": "They said, 'Ask your Lord to make it clear to us what it should be like. Cows are all much the same to us. Then, if Allah wills, we will be guided.'",
    "2:71": "He said, 'He says it should be a cow not trained to plough or irrigate the fields - completely sound, without a blemish on it.' They said, 'Now you have brought the truth.' So they sacrificed it - but they almost did not do it.",
    "2:72": "Remember when you killed someone and violently accused each other of it, and Allah brought out what you were hiding.",
    "2:73": "We said, 'Hit him with part of it!' In that way Allah gives life to the dead and He shows you His Signs so that hopefully you will understand.",
    "2:74": "Then your hearts became hardened after that, so they were like rocks or even harder still. There are some rocks from which rivers gush out, and others which split open and water pours out, and others which crash down from fear of Allah. Allah is not unaware of what you do.",
    "2:75": "Do you really hope they will follow you in iman when a group of them heard Allah's Word and then, after grasping it, knowingly distorted it?",
    "2:76": "When they meet those who have iman, they say, 'We have iman.' But when they go apart with one another, they say, 'Why do you speak to them about what Allah has disclosed to you, so they can use it as an argument against you before your Lord? Will you not use your intellect?'",
    "2:77": "Do they not know that Allah knows what they keep secret and what they make public?",
    "2:78": "Some of them are illiterate, knowing nothing of the Book but wishful thinking. They only speculate.",
    "2:79": "Woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say 'This is from Allah' to sell it for a paltry price. Woe to them for what their hands have written! Woe to them for what they earn!",
    "2:80": "They say, 'The Fire will only touch us for a number of days.' Say, 'Have you made a contract with Allah - then Allah will not break His contract - or are you rather saying about Allah what you do not know?'",
    "2:81": "No indeed! Those who accumulate bad actions and are surrounded by their mistakes, such people are the Companions of the Fire, remaining in it timelessly, for ever;",
    "2:82": "whereas those who have iman and do right actions, such people are the Companions of the Garden, remaining in it timelessly, for ever.",
    "2:83": "Remember when We made a covenant with the tribe of Israel: 'Worship none but Allah and be good to your parents and to relatives and orphans and the very poor. And speak good words to people. And establish salat and pay zakat.' But then you turned away - except a few of you - you turned aside.",
    "2:84": "And when We made a covenant with you not to shed your blood and not to expel one another from your homes, you agreed and were all witnesses.",
    "2:85": "Then you are the people who are killing one another and expelling a group among you from their homes, ganging up against them in wrongdoing and enmity. Yet if they are brought to you as captives, you ransom them, when it was forbidden for you to expel them in the first place! Do you, then, believe in one part of the Book and reject the other? What repayment will there be for any of you who do that except disgrace in this world? And on the Day of Rising, they will be returned to the harshest of punishments. Allah is not unaware of what ytheyou do.",
    "2:86": "Those are the people who trade the Next World for this world. The punishment will not be lightened for them. They will not be helped.",
    "2:87": "We gave Musa the Book and sent a succession of Messengers after him. We gave 'Isa, son of Maryam, the Clear Signs and reinforced him with the Purest Ruh. Why then, whenever a Messenger came to you with something your lower selves did not desire, did you grow arrogant, and deny some of them and murder others?",
    "2:88": "They say, 'Our hearts are uncircumcised.' Rather, Allah has cursed them for their kufr. What little iman they have!",
    "2:89": "When a Book does come to them from Allah, confirming what is with them - even though before that they were praying for victory over the kafirun - yet when what they recognise does come to them, they reject it. Allah's curse is on the kafirun.",
    "2:90": "What an evil thing they have sold themselves for in rejecting what Allah has sent down, outraged that Allah should send down His favour on whichever of His slaves He wills. They have brought down anger upon anger on themselves. The kafirun will have a humiliating punishment.",
    "2:91": "When they are told, 'Have iman in what Allah has sent down,' they say, 'Our iman is in what was sent down to us,' and they reject anything beyond that, even though it is the truth, confirming what they have. Say, 'Why then, if you are muminun, did you previously kill the Prophets of Allah?'",
    "2:92": "Musa brought you the Clear Signs; then, after he left, you adopted the Calf and were wrongdoers.",
    "2:93": "Remember when We made a covenant with you and lifted up the Mount above your heads: 'Take hold vigorously of what We have given you and listen.' They said, 'We hear and disobey.' They were made to drink the Calf into their hearts because of their kufr. Say, 'If you are muminun, what an evil thing your iman has",
    "2:94": "Say, 'If the abode of the akhira with Allah is for you alone, to the exclusion of all others, then long for death if you are telling the truth.'",
    "2:95": "But they will never ever long for it because of what they have done. Allah knows the wrongdoers.",
    "2:96": "Rather you will find them the people greediest for life, along with the idolaters. Any of them would love to be allowed to live a thousand years. But being allowed to live would not save him from the punishment. Allah sees what they do.",
    "2:97": "Say, 'Anyone who is the enemy of Jibril should know that it was he who brought it down upon your heart, by Allah's authority, confirming what came before, and as guidance and good news for the muminun.",
    "2:98": "Anyone who is the enemy of Allah and of His angels, and of His Messengers and of Jibril and Mika'il, should know that Allah is the enemy of the kafirun.'",
    "2:99": "We have sent down Clear Signs to you and no one rejects them except the deviators.",
    "2:100": "Why is it that, whenever they make a contract, a group of them disdainfully tosses it aside? No indeed!",
    "2:101": "When a Messenger comes to them from Allah confirming what is with them, a group of those who have been given the Book disdainfully toss the Book of Allah behind their backs, just as if they did not know.",
    "2:106": "Whenever We abrogate an ayat or cause it to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or equal to it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?",
    "2:107": "Do you not know that Allah is He to Whom the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs and that, besides Allah, you have no protector and no helper?",
    "2:108": "Or do you want to question your Messenger as Musa was questioned before? Anyone who exchanges iman for kufr has definitely gone astray from the level way.",
    "2:109": "Many of the People of the Book would love it if they could make you revert to being kuffar after you have become muminun, showing their innate envy now that the truth is clear to them. But you should pardon and overlook until Allah gives His command. Truly Allah has power over all things.",
    "2:110": "Establish salat and pay zakat. Any good you send ahead for yourselves, you will find with Allah. Certainly Allah sees what you do.",
    "2:111": "They say, 'No one will enter the Garden except for Jews and Christians.' Such is their vain hope. Say, 'Produce your evidence if you are telling the truth.'",
    "2:112": "Not so! All who submit themselves completely to Allah and are good-doers will find their reward with their Lord. They will feel no fear and will know no sorrow.",
    "2:113": "The Jews say, 'The Christians have nothing to stand on,' and the Christians say, 'The Jews have nothing to stand on,' yet they both recite the Book. Those who do not know say the same as they say. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Rising regarding the things about which they differ.",
    "2:114": "Who could do greater wrong than someone who bars access to the mosques of Allah, preventing His name from being remembered in them, and goes about destroying them? Such people will never be able to enter them - except in fear. They will have disgrace in the dunya and in the akhira they will have a terrible punishment.",
    "2:115": "Both East and West belong to Allah, so wherever you turn, the Face of Allah is there. Allah is All- Encompassing, All-Knowing.",
    "2:116": "They say, 'Allah has a son.' Glory be to Him! No, everything in the heavens and earth belongs to Him. Everything is obedient to Him,",
    "2:117": "the Originator of the heavens and earth. When He decides on something, He just says to it, 'Be!' and it is.",
    "2:118": "Those who do not know say, 'If only Allah would speak to us, or some sign come to us!' just like those before them who said the same as they say. Their hearts are much the same. We have made the Signs clear for people who have certainty.",
    "2:119": "We have sent you with the Truth, bringing good news and giving warning. Do not ask about the inhabitants of the Blazing Fire.",
    "2:120": "The Jews and the Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their religion. Say, 'Allah's guidance is the true guidance.' If you were to follow their whims and desires, after the knowledge that has come to you, you would find no protector or helper against Allah.",
    "2:121": "Those to whom We have given the Book, who recite it in the way it should be recited, such people have iman in it. As for those who reject it, they are the losers.",
    "2:122": "Tribe of Israel! remember the blessing I conferred on you, and that I preferred you over all other beings.",
    "2:123": "Have fear of a Day when no self will be able to compensate for another in any way, and no ransom will be accepted from it, and no intercession benefit it, and they will not be helped.",
    "2:124": "Remember when Ibrahim was tested by his Lord with certain words which he carried out completely. He said, 'I will make you a model for mankind.' He asked, 'And what of my descendants?' He said, 'My contract does not include the wrongdoers.'",
    "2:125": "And when We made the House* a place of return, a sanctuary for mankind: They took the Maqam of Ibrahim as a place of prayer. We contracted with Ibrahim and Isma'il: 'Purify My House for those who circle it, and those who stay there, and those who bow and who prostrate.'",
    "2:126": "And when Ibrahim said, 'My Lord, make this a place of safety and provide its inhabitants with fruits - all of them who have iman in Allah and the Last Day,' He said, 'I will let anyone who becomes a kafir enjoy himself a little but then I will drive him to the punishment of the Fire. What an evil destination!'",
    "2:127": "And when Ibrahim built the foundations of the House with Isma'il: 'Our Lord, accept this from us! You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",
    "2:128": "Our Lord, make us both Muslims submitted to You, and our descendants a Muslim community submitted to You. Show us our rites of worship and turn towards us. You are the Ever-Returning, the Most Merciful.",
    "2:129": "Our Lord, raise up among them a Messenger from them to recite Your Signs to them and teach them the Book and Wisdom and purify them. You are the Almighty, the All-Wise.'",
    "2:130": "Who would deliberately renounce the religion of Ibrahim except someone who reveals himself to be a fool? We chose him in this world and in the Next World he will be one of the righteous.",
    "2:131": "When his Lord said to him, 'Become a Muslim!' he said, 'I am a Muslim who has submitted to the Lord of all the worlds.'",
    "2:132": "Ibrahim directed his sons to this, as did Ya'qub: 'My sons! Allah has chosen this deen for you, so do not die except as Muslims.'",
    "2:133": "Or were you present when death came to Ya'qub and he said to his sons, 'What will you worship when I have gone?' They said, 'We will worship your God, the God of your forefathers, Ibrahim, Isma'il and Ishaq - one God. We are Muslims submitted to Him.'",
    "2:134": "That was a community which has long since passed away. It has what it earned. You have what you have earned. You will not be questioned about what they did.",
    "2:135": "They say, 'Be Jews or Christians and you will be guided.' Say, 'Rather adopt the religion of Ibrahim, a",
    "2:136": "Say, 'We have iman in Allah and what has been sent down to us and what was sent down to Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq and Ya'qub and the Tribes, and what Musa and 'Isa were given, and what all the Prophets were given by their Lord. We do not differentiate between any of them. We are Muslims submitted to Him.'",
    "2:137": "If their iman is the same as yours then they are guided. But if they turn away, they are entrenched in hostility. Allah will be enough for you against them. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",
    "2:138": "The colouring of Allah - and what colouring could be better than Allah's? It is Him we worship.",
    "2:139": "Say, 'Do you argue with us about Allah when He is our Lord and your Lord? We have our actions and you have your actions. We act for Him alone.'",
    "2:140": "Or do they say that Ibrahim and Isma'il and Ishaq and Ya'qub and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say, 'Do you know better or does Allah?' Who could do greater wrong than someone who hides the evidence he has been given by Allah? Allah is not unaware of what you do.",
    "2:141": "That was a community which has long since passed away. It has what it earned. You have what you have earned. You will not be questioned about what they did.",
    "2:146": "Those We have given the Book recognise it as they recognise their own sons. Yet a group of them knowingly conceal the truth.",

    "2:148": "Each person faces a particular direction so race each other to the good. Wherever you are, Allah will bring you all together. Truly Allah has power over all things.",
    "2:149": "Wherever you come from, turn your face to the Masjid al-Haram. This is certainly the truth from your Lord. Allah is not unaware of what you do.",
    "2:150": "Wherever you come from, turn your face to the Masjid al-Haram. Wherever you are, turn your faces towards it so that people will have no argument against you - except for those among them who do wrong and then you should not fear them but rather fear Me - and so that I may complete My blessing upon you so that hopefully you will be guided.",
    "2:151": "For this We sent a Messenger to you from among you to recite Our Signs to you and purify you and teach you the Book and Wisdom and teach you things you did not know before.",

Rather, those with true devoutness are those who have iman in Allah and the Last Day, the Angels, the Book and the Prophets, and who, despite their love for it, give away their wealth to their relatives and to orphans and the very poor, and to travellers and beggars and to set slaves free, and who establish salat and pay zakat; those who honour their contracts when they make them, and are steadfast in poverty and illness and in battle. Those are the people who are true. They are the people who have taqwa.",

But if someone is absolved by his brother, blood-money should be claimed with correctness and paid with good will. That is an easement and a mercy from your Lord. Anyone who goes beyond the limits after this will receive a painful punishment.",

Any of you who are resident for the month should fast it. But any of you who are ill or on a journey should fast a number of other days. Allah desires ease for you; He does not desire difficulty for you. You should complete the number of days and proclaim Allah's greatness for the guidance He has given you so that hopefully you will be thankful.",

But do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal has reached the place of sacrifice. If any of you are ill or have a head injury, the expiation is fasting or sadaqa or sacrifice when you are safe and well again. Anyone who comes out of ihram between 'umra and hajj should make whatever sacrifice is feasible. For any one who cannot, there are three days' fast on hajj and seven on your return - that is ten in all. That is for anyone whose family does not live near the Masjid al-Haram.

Fitna is worse than killing.' They will not stop fighting you until they make you revert from your deen, if they are able.

It is not lawful for you to keep anything you have given them unless a couple fear that they will not remain within Allah's limits. If you fear that they will not remain within Allah's limits, there is nothing wrong in the wife ransoming herself with some of what she received. These are Allah's limits, so do not overstep them. Those who overstep Allah's limits are wrongdoers.",
    "2:230": "But if a man divorces his wife a third time, she is not halal for him after that until she has married another husband. Then if he divorces her, there is nothing wrong in the original couple getting back together provided they think they will remain within Allah's limits. These are Allah's limits which He has made clear to people who know.",

Do not retain them by force, thus overstepping the limits. Anyone who does that has wronged himself. Do not make a mockery of Allah's Signs. Remember Allah's blessing upon you and the Book and Wisdom He has sent down to you to admonish you. Have taqwa of Allah and know that Allah has knowledge of all things.",

It is the duty of the fathers to feed and clothe them with correctness and courtesy - no self is charged with more than it can bear. No mother should be put under pressure in respect of her child nor any father in respect of his child. The same duty is incumbent on the heir. If the couple both wish weaning to take place after mutual agreement and consultation, there is nothing wrong in their doing so. If you wish to find wet- nurses for your children, there is nothing wrong in your doing so provided you hand over to them what you have agreed to give with correctness and courtesy.

Know that Allah knows what is in your selves, so beware of Him! And know that Allah is Ever-Forgiving, All-Forbearing.",

But give them a gift - he who is wealthy according to his means and he who is less well off according to his means - a gift to be given with correctness and courtesy: a duty for all good-doers.",
    "2:237": "If you divorce them before you have touched them but have already allotted them a dowry, they should have half the amount which you allotted, unless they forgo it or the one in charge of the marriage contract forgoes it. To forgo it is closer to taqwa. Do not forget to show generosity to one another. Allah sees what you do.",

    "2:245": "Is there anyone who will make Allah a generous loan so that He can multiply it for him many times over? Allah both restricts and expands. And you will be returned to Him.",
    "2:246": "What do you think about the council of the tribe of Israel after Musa's time when they said to one of their Prophets, 'Give us a king and we will fight in the Way of Allah!'? He said, 'Is it not possible that if fighting were prescribed for you, you would not fight?' They said, 'How could we not fight in the way of Allah when we have been driven from our homes and children?' But then when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned their backs - except for a few of them. Allah knows the wrongdoers.",
    "2:247": "Their Prophet said to them, 'Allah has appointed Saul to be your king.' They said, 'How can he have kingship over us when we have much more right to kingship than he does? He has not even much wealth!' He said, 'Allah has chosen him over you and increased him greatly in knowledge and physical strength. Allah gives kingship to anyone He wills. Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.'",
    "2:248": "Their Prophet said to them, 'The sign of his kingship is that the Ark will come to you, containing serenity from your Lord and certain relics left by the families of Musa and Harun. It will be borne by angels. There is a sign for you in that if you are muminun.'",
    "2:249": "When Talut marched out with the army, he said, 'Allah will test you with a river. Anyone who drinks from it is not with me. But anyone who does not taste it is with me - except for him who merely scoops up a little in his hand.' But they drank from it - except for a few of them. Then when he and those who had iman with him had crossed it, they said, 'We do not have the strength to face Goliath and his troops today.' But those who were sure that they were going to meet Allah said, 'How many a small force has triumphed over a much greater one by Allah's permission! Allah is with the steadfast.",

    "2:251": "And with Allah's permission they routed them. Dawud killed Saul and Allah gave him kingship and wisdom and taught him whatever He willed. If it were not for Allah's driving some people back by means of others, the earth would have been corrupted. But Allah shows favour to all the worlds.",
    "2:252": "Those are Allah's Signs which We recite to you with truth. You are indeed one of the Messengers.",
    "2:253": "These Messengers: We favoured some of them over others. Allah spoke directly to some of them and raised up some of them in rank. We gave Clear Signs to 'Isa, son of Maryam, and reinforced him with the Purest Ruh. If Allah had willed, those who came after them would not have fought each other after the Clear Signs came to them, but they differed. Among them there are those who have iman and among them there are those who are kafir. If Allah had willed, they would not have fought each other. But Allah does whatever He desires.",
    "2:254": "You who have iman! give away some of what We have provided for you before a Day arrives on which there is no trading, no close friendship and no intercession. It is the kafirun who are the wrongdoers.",

Who can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them but they cannot grasp any of His knowledge save what He wills. His Footstool encompasses the heavens and the earth and their preservation does not tire Him. He is the Most High, the Magnificent.",

He said, 'Take four birds and train them to yourself. Then put a part of them on each mountain and call to them; they will come rushing to you. Know that Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.'",
    "2:261": "The metaphor of those who spend their wealth in the Way of Allah is that of a grain which produces seven ears; in every ear there are a hundred grains. Allah gives such multiplied increase to whomever He wills. Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.",

His likeness is that of a smooth rock coated with soil, which, when heavy rain falls on it, is left stripped bare. They have no power over anything they have earned. Allah does not guide kafir people.",

In this way Allah makes His Signs clear to you, so that hopefully you will reflect.",

    "2:275": "Those who practise usury will not rise from the grave except as someone driven mad by Shaytan's touch. That is because they say, 'Trade is the same as usury.' But Allah has permitted trade and He has forbidden usury. Whoever is given a warning by his Lord and then desists, may keep what he received in the past and his affair is Allah's concern. But all who return to it will be the Companions of the Fire, remaining in it timelessly, for ever.",

Those with deviation in their hearts follow what is open to interpretation in it, desiring conflict, seeking its inner meaning. No one knows its inner meaning but Allah. Those firmly rooted in knowledge say, 'We have iman in it. All of it is from our Lord.' But only people of intelligence pay heed.",

    "3:14": "There was a sign for you in the two parties which met face to face, one party fighting in the Way of Allah and the other kafirun. You saw them as twice their number with your own eyes.

I will heal the blind and lepers, and bring the dead to life, by Allah's permission. I will tell you what you eat and what you store up in your homes. There is a Sign for you in that if you are muminun.",

But there are others among them who, if you entrust them with just a single dinar, will not return it to you, unless you stay standing over them.

    "3:112": "They will be plunged into abasement wherever they are found, unless they have a treaty with Allah and with the people. They have brought down anger from Allah upon themselves, and they have been plunged into destitution. That was because they rejected Allah's Signs and killed the Prophets without any right to do so. That was because they disobeyed and went beyond the limits.",
    "3:113": "They are not all the same. There is a community among the People of the Book who are upright. They recite Allah's Signs throughout the night, and they prostrate.",

    "3:117": "The metaphor of what they spend in their life in this world is that of a wind with an icy bite to it which strikes the crops of a people who have wronged themselves and destroys them. Allah did not wrong them; rather it was themselves they were wronging.",

But then you faltered, disputing the command, and disobeyed after He showed you what you love.* Among you are those who want this world and among you are those who want the next World. Then He turned you from them in order to test you - but He has pardoned you. Allah shows favour to the muminun.",
    "3:153": "Remember when you were scrambling up the slope, refusing to turn back for anyone, and the would not feel grief for what escaped you or what assailed you. Allah is aware of what you do.",
    "3:154": "Then He sent down to you, after the distress, security, restful sleep overtaking a group of you, whereas another group became prey to anxious thoughts, thinking other than the truth about Allah - thoughts belonging to the Time of Ignorance - saying, 'Do we have any say in the affair at all?' Say, 'The affair belongs entirely to Allah.' They are concealing within themselves things which they do not disclose to you, saying, 'If we had only had a say in the affair, none of us would have been killed here in this place.' Say, 'Even if you had been inside your homes, those people for whom being killed was decreed would have gone out to their place of death.' So that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts. Allah knows all that your hearts contain.",

It is Allah Who gives life and causes to die. Allah sees what you do.",

    "3:167": "and so that He would know the hypocrites. They were told, 'Come and fight in the Way of Allah or at least help defend us.' They said, 'If we knew there would be a fight, we would certainly follow you.' They were closer to kufr that day than to iman, saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts. And Allah knows best what they are hiding.",

Do not consume it extravagantly and precipitately before they come of age. Those who are wealthy should abstain from it altogether. Those who are poor should use it sensibly and correctly. When you hand over their property to them ensure that there are witnesses on their behalf. Allah suffices as a Reckoner.",

If she is one on her own she receives a half. Each of your parents receives a sixth of what you leave if you have children. If you are childless and your heirs are your parents your mother receives a third. If you have brothers or sisters your you do not know which of them is going to benefit you more. These are obligatory shares from Allah. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",

Nor may you treat them harshly so that you can make off with part of what you have given them, unless they commit an act of flagrant indecency. Live together with them correctly and courteously. If you dislike them, it may well be that you dislike something in which Allah has placed a lot of good.",

    "4:22": "Do not marry any women your fathers married - except for what may have already taken place. That is an indecent act, a loathsome thing and an evil path.",

Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "4:24": "And also married women, except for those you have taken in war as slaves. This is what Allah has prescribed for you. Apart from that He has made all other women halal for you provided you seek them with your wealth in marriage and not in fornication. When you consummate your marriage with them give them their prescribed dowry. There is nothing wrong in any further agreement you might come to after the dowry has been given. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "4:25": "If any of you do not have the means to marry free women who are muminun, you may marry slavegirls who are muminun. Allah knows best about your iman; you are all the same in that respect. Marry them with their owners' permission and give them their dowries correctly and courteously as married women, not in fornication or taking them as lovers. When they are married, if they commit fornication they should receive half the punishment of free women. This is for those of you who are afraid of committing fornication. But being patient is better for you. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",

    "4:32": "Do not covet what Allah has given to some of you in preference to others - men have a portion of what they acquire and women have a portion of what they acquire; but ask Allah for His bounty. Allah has knowledge of all things.",
    "4:33": "We have appointed heirs for everything that parents and relatives leave. If you have a bond with people, give them their share. Allah is a witness of all things.",
    "4:34": "Men have charge of women because Allah has preferred the one above the other and because they spend their wealth on them. Right-acting women are obedient, safeguarding their husbands' interests in their absence as Allah has guarded them. If there are women whose disobedience you fear, you may admonish them, refuse to sleep with them, and then beat them. But if they obey you, do not look for a way to punish them. Allah is All-High, Most Great.",

Be good to your parents and relatives and to orphans and the very poor, and to neighbours who are related to you and neighbours who are not related to you, and to companions and travellers and your slaves. Allah does not love anyone vain or boastful.",

    "4:42": "On that day those who were kafir and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they were one with the level earth. They will not be able to hide a single circumstance from Allah.",

If you are ill or on a journey, or any of you have come from the lavatory or touched women, and you cannot find any water, then do tayammum with pure earth, wiping your faces and your hands.

If they had said, 'We hear and we obey,' and 'Listen,' and, 'Undhurna!' that would have been better for them and more upright. But Allah has cursed them for their kufr. Very few of them have iman.",
    "4:47": "You who have been given the Book! have iman in what We have sent down confirming what is with you, before We obliterate faces, turning them inside out, or We curse you as We cursed the Companions of the Sabbath. Allah's command is always carried out.",
    "4:48": "Allah does not forgive anything being associated with Him but He forgives whoever He wills for anything other than that. Anyone who associates something with Allah has committed a terrible crime.",

    "4:50": "Look how they invent lies against Allah. That suffices as an outright felony.",
    "4:51": "Do you not see those who were given a portion of the Book having iman in idols and false gods and saying to those who are kafir, 'These people are better guided on their path than the muminun'?",
    "4:52": "Those are the ones Allah has cursed. And if someone is cursed by Allah you will not find any one to help him.",
    "4:53": "Or do they indeed really own a portion of Allah's kingdom? In that case they do not give so much as a scrap to other people!",

    "4:59": "You who have iman! obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in command among you. If you have a dispute about something, refer it back to Allah and the Messenger, if you have iman in Allah and the Last Day. That is the best thing to do and gives the best result.",
    "4:60": "Do you not see those who claim that they have iman in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you, still desiring to turn to a satanic source for judgement in spite of being ordered to reject it? Shaytan wants to misguide them far away.",
    "4:61": "When they are told, 'Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger,' you see the hypocrites turning away from you completely.",

    "4:72": "Among you there are people who hang back and if you encounter a setback then they say, 'Allah has blessed me in that I was not there with them.'",
    "4:73": "But if you meet with favour from Allah they say - as if there were no friendship between you and them - 'Oh! If only I had been with them so that I too might have won a great victory.'",

    "4:76": "Those who have iman fight in the Way of Allah. Those who are kafir fight in the way of false gods. So fight the friends of Shaytan! Shaytan's scheming is always feeble.",
    "4:77": "Do you not see those who were told: 'Hold back from fighting but establish salat and pay zakat'? Then when fighting is prescribed for them, a group of them fear people as Allah should be feared, or even more than that. They say, 'Our Lord, why have you prescribed fighting for us? If only You would give us just a little You will not be wronged by so much as the smallest speck.'",

But if a bad thing happens to them, they say, 'This has come from you.' Say, 'Everything comes from Allah.' What is the matter with these people that they scarcely understand a single word?",
    "4:79": "Any good thing that happens to you comes from Allah. Any bad thing that happens to you comes from yourself. We have sent you to mankind as a Messenger. Allah suffices as a Witness.",

    "4:81": "They have the word, 'Obedience!' on their tongues but when they leave your presence, a group of them spend the night plotting to do other than what you say. Allah is recording their nocturnal plotting. So let them be and put your trust in Allah. Allah suffices as a Guardian.",

    "4:83": "When news of any matter reaches them they spread it about, whether it is of a reassuring or disquieting nature. If they had only referred it to the Messenger and those in command among them, those among them able to discern the truth about it would have had proper knowledge of it. If it were not for Allah's favour to you and His mercy, all but a very few of you would have followed Shaytan.",
    "4:84": "So fight in the way of Allah - you are only answerable for yourself - and spur on the muminun. It may well be that Allah will curb the force of the kuffar. Allah has greater force and greater power to punish.",
    "4:85": "Those who join forces for good will receive a reward for it. Those who join forces for evil will be answerable for it. Allah gives all things what they deserve.",
    "4:86": "When you are greeted with a greeting, return the greeting or improve on it. Allah takes account of everything.",
    "4:87": "Allah, there is no god but Him. He will gather you to the Day of Rising about which there is no doubt. And whose speech could be truer than Allah's?",
    "4:88": "How is it that you have become two parties regarding the hypocrites, when Allah has returned them to kufr for what they did? Do you desire to guide people Allah has misguided? When Allah misguides someone, you will find no way for him.",
    "4:89": "They would like you to be kafir as they are kafir so that you will all be the same. Do not take any of them as friends until they have made hijra in the Way of Allah. But if they run away then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. Do not take any of them as either a friend or helper -",
    "4:90": "except for those who seek shelter with people with whom you have a treaty, or who come to you greatly perturbed at the prospect of fighting either you or their own people. If Allah had willed, He could have given them the upper hand over you and then they would have fought you. If they keep away from you and do not fight you and submit to you, Allah has not given you any way against such people.",
    "4:91": "You will find others who desire to be safe from you and safe from their own people. Each time they are returned to fitna they are overwhelmed by it. If they do not keep away from you or submit to you or refrain from fighting, seize them and kill them wherever you find them. Over such people We have given you clear authority.",
    "4:95": "Those muminun who stay behind - other than those forced to by necessity - are not the same as those who do jihad in the Way of Allah, sacrificing their wealth and themselves. Allah has given those who do jihad with their wealth and themselves a higher rank than those who stay behind. Allah has promised the Best to both, but Allah has preferred those who do jihad over those who stay behind by an immense reward:",
    "4:96": "high ranks conferred by Him as well as forgiveness and mercy. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",

    "4:114": "There is no good in much of their secret talk, except in the case of those who enjoin sadaqa, or what is right, or putting things right between people. If anyone does that, seeking the pleasure of Allah, We will give him an immense reward.",
    "4:115": "But if anyone opposes the Messenger after the guidance has become clear to him, and follows other than the path of the muminun, We will hand him over to whatever he has turned to, and We will roast him in Hell. What an evil destination!",
    "4:116": "Allah does not forgive anything being associated with Him but He forgives whoever He wills for anything other than that. Anyone who associates something with Allah has gone very far astray.",
    "4:117": "What they call on apart from Him are female idols. What they call on is an arrogant shaytan",
    "4:118": "whom Allah has cursed. He said, 'I will take a certain fixed proportion of Your slaves.",
    "4:119": "I will lead them astray and fill them with false hopes. I will command them and they will cut off cattle's ears. I will command them and they will change Allah's creation.' Anyone who takes Shaytan as his protector in place of Allah has clearly lost everything.",
    "4:120": "He makes promises to them and fills them with false hopes. But what Shaytan promises them is nothing but delusion.",
    "4:121": "The shelter of such people will be Hell. They will find no way to escape from it.",
    "4:122": "But as for those who have iman and do right actions, We will admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever and ever. Allah's promise is true. Whose speech could be truer than Allah's?",
    "4:123": "It is not a matter of wishful thinking on your part nor of the wishful thinking of the People of the Book. Anyone who does evil will be repaid for it. He will not find any protector or helper besides Allah.",
    "4:124": "Anyone, male or female, who does right actions and is a mumin, will enter the Garden. They will not be wronged by so much as the tiniest speck.",
    "4:125": "Who could have a better deen than someone who submits himself completely to Allah and is a good- doer, and follows the religion of Ibrahim, a man of pure natural belief? Allah took Ibrahim as an intimate friend.",
    "4:126": "What is in the heavens and in the earth belongs to Allah. Allah encompasses all things.",
    "4:127": "They will ask you for a fatwa about women. Say, 'Allah gives you a fatwa about them; and also what is recited to you in the Book about orphan girls to whom you do not give the inheritance they are owed, while at the same time desiring to marry them; and also about young children who are denied their rights: that you should act justly with respect to orphans.' Whatever good you do, Allah knows it.",
    "4:128": "If a woman fears cruelty or aversion on her husband's part, there is nothing wrong in the couple becoming reconciled. Reconciliation is better. But people are prone to selfish greed. If you do good and have taqwa, Allah is aware of what you do.",

    "4:135": "You who have iman! be upholders of justice, bearing witness for Allah alone, even against yourselves or your parents and relatives. Whether they are rich or poor, Allah is well able to look after them. Do not follow your own desires and deviate from the truth. If you twist or turn away, Allah is aware of what you do.",
    "4:136": "You who have iman! have iman in Allah and His Messenger and in the Book He sent down to His and His Messengers and the Last Day has gone very far astray.",

    "4:140": "It has been sent down to you in the Book that when you hear Allah's Signs being rejected and mocked at by people, you must not sit with them till they start talking of other things. If you do you are just the same as them. Allah will gather all the hypocrites and kafirun into Hell.",
    "4:141": "Those who anticipate the worst for you say, 'Were we not with you?' whenever you gain a victory from Allah, but if the kuffar have a success they say, 'Did we not have the upper hand over you and yet in spite of that keep the muminun away from you?' Allah will judge between you on the Day of Rising. Allah will not give the kuffar any way against the muminun.",
    "4:142": "The hypocrites think they deceive Allah, but He is deceiving them. When they get up to pray, they get up lazily, showing off to people, and only remembering Allah a very little.",
    "4:143": "They vacillate between the two - not joining these or joining those. If Allah misguides someone, you will not find any way for him to go.",
    "4:144": "You who have iman! do not take the kafirun as friends rather than the muminun. Do you want to give Allah clear proof against you?",

    "4:153": "The People of the Book will ask you to bring down a Book from heaven to them. They asked Musa for even more than that. They said, 'Let us see Allah with our own eyes.' So the lightning-bolt struck them down for their wrongdoing. Then they adopted the Calf after the Clear Signs had come to them, but We pardoned them for that and gave Musa clear authority.",
    "4:154": "We lifted up the Mount above their heads in accordance with the covenant they had made, and We said to them, 'Enter the gate prostrating,' and We said to them, 'Do not break the Sabbath,' and We made a binding covenant with them.",
    "4:155": "Because of the fact that they broke their covenant, and rejected Allah's Signs, and killed the Prophets without any right to do so and said, 'Our hearts are uncircumcised,' Allah has stamped them with kufr, so they do not have iman except for very few.",

    "4:157": "and their saying, 'We killed the Messiah, 'Isa son of Maryam, Messenger of Allah.' They did not kill him and they did not crucify him but it was made to seem so to them.

    "4:163": "We have revealed to you as We revealed to Nuh and the Prophets who came after him. And We revealed to Ibrahim and Isma'il and Ishaq and Ya'qub and the Tribes, and 'Isa and Ayyub and Yunus and Harun and Sulayman. And We gave Dawud the Zabur.",

    "4:170": "Mankind! the Messenger has brought you the truth from your Lord, so it is better for you to have iman. But if you are kafir, everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "4:171": "People of the Book! do not go to excess in your deen. Say nothing but the truth about Allah. The and a Spirit from Him. So have iman in Allah and His Messengers. Do not say, 'Three.' It is better that you stop. Allah is only One God. He is too Glorious to have a son! Everything in the heavens and in the earth belongs to Him. Allah suffices as a Guardian.",
    "4:172": "The Messiah would never disdain to be a slave to Allah nor would the angels near to Him. If any do disdain to worship Him, and grow arrogant, He will in any case gather them all to Him.",
    "4:173": "As for those who have iman and do right actions, He will pay them their wages in full and will give them increase from His favour. As for those who show disdain and grow arrogant, He will punish them with a painful punishment. They will not find any protector or helper for themselves besides Allah.",
    "4:174": "Mankind! a clear proof has come to you from your Lord. We have sent down a Clear Light to you.",
    "4:175": "As for those who have iman in Allah and hold fast to Him, He will admit them into mercy and favour from Him and will guide them to Him on a straight path.",
    "4:176": "They will ask you for a fatwa. Say: 'Allah gives you a fatwa about people who die without direct heirs: If a man dies childless but has a sister she receives half of what he leaves, and he is her heir if she dies childless. If there are two sisters they receive two-thirds of what he leaves. If there are brothers and sisters the knowledge of all things.'",
    "5:1": "You who have iman! fulfil your contracts. All livestock animals are halal for you, except those that are recited to you now; but it is still not halal to hunt while you are in ihram. Allah makes whatever judgements He wills.",
    "5:2": "You who have iman! do not profane the sacred rites of Allah or the sacred months, or the sacrificial animals, or the ritual garlands, or those heading for the Sacred House, desiring profit and good pleasure from their Lord. When you have come out of ihram, then hunt for game. Do not let hatred for a people who debar you from the Masjid al-Haram incite you into going beyond the limits. Help each other to goodness and taqwa. Do not help each other to wrongdoing and enmity. Have taqwa of Allah. Allah is severe in retribution.",
    "5:6": "You who have iman! when you get up to do salat, wash your faces and your hands and your arms to the elbows, and wipe over your heads, and wash your feet to the ankles. If you are in a state of major impurity, then purify yourselves. But if you are ill or on a journey, or have come from the lavatory, or have touched women, and cannot find any water, then do tayammum with pure earth, and wipe your faces and your hands. Allah does not want to make things difficult for you, but He does want to purify you and to perfect His blessing upon you so that hopefully you will be thankful.",
    "5:7": "Remember Allah's blessing to you and the covenant He made with you when you said, 'We hear and we obey.' Have taqwa of Allah. Allah knows what the heart contains.",
    "5:8": "You who have iman! show integrity for the sake of Allah, bearing witness with justice. Do not let hatred for a people incite you into not being just. Be just. That is closer to taqwa. Have taqwa of Allah. Allah is aware of what you do.",
    "5:9": "Allah has promised those who have iman and do right actions forgiveness and an immense reward.",
    "5:10": "But those who are kafir and deny Our Signs, are the Companions of the Blazing Fire.",
    "5:11": "You who have iman! remember Allah's blessing to you when certain people were on the verge of raising their hands against you and He held their hands back from you. Have taqwa of Allah. The muminun should put their trust in Allah.",
    "5:12": "Allah made a covenant with the tribe of Israel and We raised up twelve leaders from among them. Allah said, 'I am with you. If you establish salat and pay zakat, and have iman in My Messengers and respect and support them, and make a generous loan to Allah, I will erase your wrong actions from you and admit you into Gardens with rivers flowing under them. Any of you who are kafir after that have gone astray from the right way.'",
    "5:13": "But because of their breaking of their covenant, We have cursed them and made their hearts hard. They distort the true meaning of words and have forgotten a good portion of what they were reminded of. You will never cease to come upon some act of treachery on their part, except for a few of them. Yet pardon them, and overlook. Allah loves good-doers.",
    "5:14": "We also made a covenant with those who say, 'We are Christians,' and they too forgot a good portion of what they were reminded of. So We stirred up enmity and hatred between them until the Day of Rising when Allah will inform them about what they did.",
    "5:15": "People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, making clear to you much of the Book that you have kept concealed, and passing over a lot. A Light has come to you from Allah and a Clear Book.",
    "5:16": "By it, Allah guides those who follow what pleases Him to the ways of Peace. He will bring them from the darkness to the light by His permission, and guide them to a straight path.",
    "5:17": "Those who say, 'Allah is the Messiah, son of Maryam,' are kafir. Say: 'Who possesses any power at all over Allah if He desires to destroy the Messiah, son of Maryam, and his mother, and everyone else on earth?' The kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything between them belongs to Allah. He creates whatever He wills. Allah has power over all things.",
    "5:18": "The Jews and Christians say, 'We are Allah's children and His loved ones.' Say: 'Why, then, does He punish you for your wrong actions? No, you are merely human beings among those He has created. He forgives whoever He wills and He punishes whoever He wills. The kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything between them belongs to Allah. He is our final destination.'",
    "5:19": "People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, making things clear to you, after a period with no you bringing good news and a warning. Allah has power over all things.",
    "5:20": "Remember when Musa said to his people, 'My people! remember Allah's blessing to you when He appointed Prophets among you and appointed kings for you, and gave you what He had not given to anyone else in all the worlds!",
    "5:21": "'My people! enter the Holy Land which Allah has ordained for you Do not turn back in your tracks and so become transformed into losers.'",
    "5:22": "They said, 'There are tyrants in it, Musa. We will not enter it until they leave. If they leave it, then we will go in.'",
    "5:23": "Two men among those who were afraid, but whom Allah had blessed, said, 'Enter the gate against them! Once you have entered it, you will be victorious. Put your trust in Allah if you are muminun.'",
    "5:24": "They said, 'We will never enter it, Musa, as long as they are there. So you and your Lord go and fight. We will stay sitting here.'",
    "5:25": "He said, 'My Lord, I have no control over anyone but myself and my brother, so make a clear distinction between us and this deviant people.'",
    "5:26": "He said, 'The land will be forbidden to them for forty years during which they will wander aimlessly about the earth. Do not waste grief on this deviant people.'",
    "5:27": "Recite to them the true report of Adam's two sons when they offered a sacrifice and it was accepted from one of them but not accepted from the other. The one said, 'I shall kill you.' The other said, 'Allah only accepts from people who have taqwa.",
    "5:28": "Even if you do raise your hand against me to kill me, I am not going to raise my hand against you to kill you. Truly I fear Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.",
    "5:29": "I want you to take on both my wrongdoing and your wrongdoing and so become one of the Companions of the Fire. That is the repayment of the wrongdoers.'",
    "5:30": "So his lower self persuaded him to kill his brother, and he killed him and became one of the lost.",
    "5:31": "Then Allah sent a crow which scratched at the earth to show him how to conceal his brother's corpse. He said, 'Woe is me! Can I not even be like this crow and conceal my brother's corpse?' And he became one of those who suffer bitter remorse",
    "5:32": "on account of that. So We decreed for the tribe of Israel that if someone kills another person - unless it is in retaliation for someone else or for causing corruption in the earth - it is as if he had murdered all mankind. And if anyone gives life to another person, it is as if he had given life to all mankind. Our Messengers came to them with Clear Signs but even after that many of them committed outrages in the earth.",
    "5:33": "The reprisal against those who wage war on Allah and His Messenger, and go about the earth corrupting it, is that they should be killed or crucified, or have their alternate hands and feet cut off, or be banished from the land. That will be their degradation in this world and in the Next World they will have a terrible punishment,",
    "5:34": "except for those who make tawba before you gain power over them. Know that Allah is Ever-Forgiving,",
    "5:35": "You who have iman! have taqwa of Allah and seek the means of drawing near to Him, and do jihad in His Way, so that hopefully you will be successful.",
    "5:36": "As for those who are kafir, if they had everything on the earth and the same again with it to ransom themselves from the punishment of the Day of Rising, it would not be accepted from them. They will have a painful punishment.",
    "5:37": "They will want to get out of the Fire but they will not be able to. They will have an everlasting punishment.",
    "5:38": "As for thieves, both male and female, cut off their hands in reprisal for what they have done: an object lesson from Allah. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.",
    "5:39": "But if anyone makes tawba after his wrongdoing and puts things right, Allah will turn towards him. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "5:40": "Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and earth belongs to Allah? He punishes whoever He wills and forgives whoever He wills. Allah has power over all things.",
    "5:41": "O Messenger! do not be grieved by those who rush headlong into kufr among those who say 'We have iman' with their tongues when their hearts contain no iman and among the Jews. Those who listen to lies listen to other people who have not come to you, distorting words from their proper meanings, saying, 'If you are given this, then take it. If you are not given it, then beware!' If Allah desires misguidance for someone, you cannot help him against Allah in any way. Those are the people whose hearts Allah does not want to purify. They will have disgrace in this world and in the Next World they will have a terrible punishment.",
    "5:46": "And We sent 'Isa son of Maryam following in their footsteps, confirming the Torah that came before him. We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light, confirming the Torah that came before it, and as guidance and admonition for those who have taqwa.",
    "5:47": "The people of the Gospel should judge by what Allah sent down in it. Those who do not judge by what Allah has sent down, such people are deviators.",
    "5:48": "And We have sent down the Book to you with truth, confirming and conserving the previous Books. So judge between them by what Allah has sent down and do not follow their whims and desires deviating from the Truth that has come to you. We have appointed a law and a practice for every one of you. Had Allah willed, He would have made you a single community, but He wanted to test you regarding what has come to you. So compete with each other in doing good. Every one of you will return to Allah and He will inform you regarding the things about which you differed.",
    "5:49": "Judge between them by what Allah has sent down and do not follow their whims and desires. And beware of them lest they lure you away from some of what Allah has sent down to you. If they turn their backs, then know that Allah wants to afflict them with some of their wrong actions. Many of mankind are deviators.",
    "5:50": "Do they then seek the judgement of the Time of Ignorance? Who could be better at giving judgement than Allah for people with certainty?",
    "5:51": "You who have iman! do not take the Jews and Christians as your friends; they are the friends of one another. Any of you who takes them as friends is one of them. Allah does not guide wrongdoing people.",
    "5:52": "Yet you see those with sickness in their hearts rushing to them, saying, 'We fear the wheel of fate may turn against us.' But it may well be that Allah will bring about victory or some other contingency from Him. Then they will deeply regret their secret thoughts.",
    "5:53": "Those who have iman say, 'Are these the people who swore by Allah, with their most earnest oaths, that they were with you?' Their actions have come to nothing and they now are losers.",
    "5:54": "You who have iman! if any of you renounce your deen, Allah will bring forward a people whom He loves and who love Him, humble to the muminun, fierce to the kafirun, who strive in the Way of Allah and do not fear the blame of any censurer. That is the unbounded favour of Allah which He gives to whoever He wills. Allah is Boundless, All-Knowing.",
    "5:55": "Your friend is only Allah and His Messenger and those who have iman: those who establish salat and pay zakat, and bow.",
    "5:56": "As for those who make Allah their friend, and His Messenger and those who have iman: it is the party of Allah who are victorious!",
    "5:57": "You who have iman! do not take as friends any of those given the Book before you or the kuffar who",
    "5:58": "When you call to salat they make a mockery and a game of it. That is because they are people who do not use their intellect.",
    "5:59": "Say: 'People of the Book! do you resent us for any other reason than that we have iman in Allah and what was sent down to us, and what was sent down before, and because most of you are deviators?'",
    "5:60": "Say: 'Shall I tell you of a reward with Allah far worse than that: that of those whom Allah has cursed and with whom He is angry - turning some of them into monkeys and into pigs - and who worshipped false gods? Such people are in a worse situation and further from the right way.'",
    "5:61": "When they come to you, they say, 'We have iman.' But they entered with kufr and left with it. Allah knows best what they were hiding.",
    "5:62": "You see many of them rushing to wrongdoing and enmity and acquiring ill-gotten gains. What an evil thing they do!",
    "5:63": "Why do their scholars and rabbis not prohibit them from evil speech and acquiring ill-gotten gains? What an evil thing they invent!",
    "5:64": "The Jews say, 'Allah's hand is chained.' Their hands are chained and they are cursed for what they say! No! Both His hands are open wide and He gives however He wills. What has been sent down to you from your Lord increases many of them in insolence and kufr. We have incited enmity and hatred between them until the Day of Rising. Each time they kindle the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it. They rush about the earth corrupting it. Allah does not love corrupters.",
    "5:65": "If only the People of the Book had had iman and taqwa, We would have erased their evil deeds from them and admitted them into Gardens of Delight.",
    "5:66": "If only they had implemented the Torah and the Injil and what was sent down to them from their Lord, they would have been fed from above their heads and beneath their feet. Among them there is a moderate group but what most of them do is evil.",
    "5:67": "O Messenger! transmit what has been sent down to you from your Lord. If you do not do it you will not have transmitted His Message. Allah will protect you from people. Allah does not guide the people of the kafirun.",
    "5:68": "Say: 'People of the Book! you have nothing to stand on until you implement the Torah and the Gospel and what has been sent down to you from your Lord.' What has been sent down to you from your Lord increases many of them in insolence and kufr. So do not waste your grief on the people of the kafirun.",
    "5:69": "Those who have iman and those who are Jews and the Sabaeans and the Christians, all who have iman in Allah and the Last Day and act rightly will feel no fear and will know no sorrow.",

    "5:71": "They thought there would be no fitna. They were blind and deaf. Then Allah turned towards them. Then",
    "5:72": "Those who say that the Messiah, son of Maryam, is Allah are kafirun. The Messiah said, 'Tribe of Israel! worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. If anyone associates anything with Allah, Allah has forbidden him the Garden and his refuge will be the Fire.' The wrongdoers will have no helpers.",
    "5:73": "Those who say that Allah is the third of three are kafirun. There is no god but One God. If they do not stop saying what they say, a painful punishment will afflict those among them who are kafir.",

    "5:75": "The Messiah, the son of Maryam, was only a Messenger, before whom other Messengers came and went. His mother was a woman of truth. Both of them ate food. See how We make the Signs clear to them! Then see how they are perverted!",

    "5:78": "Those among the tribe of Israel who were kafir were cursed on the tongue of Dawud and that of 'Isa, son of Maryam. That is because they rebelled and overstepped the limits.",
    "5:79": "They would not restrain one another from any of the wrong things that they did. How evil were the things they used to do!",
    "5:80": "You see many of them taking those who are kafir as their friends. What their lower selves have advanced for them is evil indeed, bringing Allah's anger down upon them. They will suffer punishment timelessly, for ever.",
    "5:81": "If they had had iman in Allah and the Prophet and what has been sent down to him, they would not have taken them as friends. But most of them are deviators.",
    "5:82": "You will find that the people most hostile to those who have iman are the Jews and the idolaters. You will find the people most affectionate to those who have iman are those who say, 'We are Christians.' That is because some of them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant.",
    "5:83": "When they listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they recognise of the truth. They say, 'Our Lord, we have iman! So write us down among the witnesses.",
    "5:84": "How could we not have iman in Allah, and the truth that has come to us, when we long for our Lord to include us among the righteous?'",
    "5:85": "Allah will reward them for what they say with Gardens with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever. That is the recompense of the good-doers.",
    "5:86": "As for those who are kafir and deny Our Signs, they are the Companions of the Blazing Fire.",
    "5:87": "You who have iman! do not make haram the good things Allah has made halal for you, and do not overstep the limits. Allah does not love people who overstep the limits.",
    "5:88": "Eat the halal and good things Allah has provided for you, and have taqwa of Allah, Him in Whom you have iman.",
    "5:89": "Allah does not take you to task for your inadvertent oaths, but He will take you to task for oaths you make intentionally. The expiation in that case is to feed ten poor people with the average amount you feed your family, or clothe them, or free a slave. Anyone without the means to do so should fast three days. That is the expiation for breaking oaths when you have sworn them. Keep your oaths. In this way Allah makes His Signs clear to you, so that hopefully you will be thankful.",
    "5:90": "You who have iman! wine and gambling, stone altars and divining arrows are filth from the handiwork of Shaytan. Avoid them completely so that hopefully you will be successful.",
    "5:91": "Shaytan wants to stir up enmity and hatred between you by means of wine and gambling, and to debar you from remembrance of Allah and from salat. Will you not then give them up?",
    "5:92": "Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and beware! If you turn your backs, know that Our Messenger is only responsible for clear transmission.",
    "5:93": "Those who have iman and do right actions are not to blame for anything they have consumed provided they have taqwa and iman and do right actions, and then again have taqwa and iman, and then have taqwa and do good. Allah loves good-doers.",
    "5:94": "You who have iman! Allah will test you with game animals which come within the reach of your hands and spears, so that Allah will know those who fear Him in the Unseen. Anyone who oversteps the limits after this will have a painful punishment.",
    "5:95": "You who have iman! do not kill game while you are in ihram. If one of you kills any deliberately, the reprisal for it is a livestock animal equivalent to what he killed, as judged by two just men among you, a sacrifice to reach the Ka'ba, or expiation by feeding the poor, or fasting commensurate with that, so that he anyone does it again Allah will take revenge on him. Allah is Almighty, Exactor of Revenge.",
    "5:96": "Anything you catch in the sea is halal for you, and all food from it, for your enjoyment and that of travellers, but land game is haram for you while you are in ihram. So have taqwa of Allah, Him to whom you will be gathered.",
    "5:97": "Allah has made the Ka'ba, the Sacred House, a special institution for mankind, and also the sacred the heavens and in the earth and that Allah has knowledge of all things.",
    "5:98": "Know that Allah is fierce in retribution and that Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "5:99": "The Messenger is only responsible for transmission. Allah knows what you divulge and what you hide.",
    "5:100": "Say: 'Bad things and good things are not the same, even though the abundance of the bad things may seem attractive to you.' Have taqwa of Allah, people of intelligence, so that hopefully you will be successful.",
    "5:101": "You who have iman! do not ask about matters which, if they were made known to you, would make things difficult for you. If you do ask about them when the Qur'an is being sent down, they will be made known to you. Allah has ignored them. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, All-Forbearing.",
    "5:102": "People before you asked about them and then later came to reject them.",
    "5:103": "Allah did not institute any such thing as bahira or sa'iba or wasila or hami. Those who were kafir invented lies against Allah. Most of them do not use their intellect.",
    "5:104": "When they are told, 'Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger,' they say, 'What we found our fathers doing is enough for us.' What! Even if their fathers did not know anything and were not guided!",
    "5:105": "You who have iman! you are only responsible for yourselves. The misguided cannot harm you as long as you are guided. All of you will return to Allah and He will inform you about what you were doing.",
    "5:106": "You who have iman! when one of you is near to death and makes a will, two just men from among you should act as witnesses; or, if you are travelling when the misfortune of death occurs, two men who are strangers to you. You should detain them after salat and, if you are doubtful, they should swear by Allah: 'We will not sell it for any price, even to a near relative, and we will not conceal the testimony of Allah. If we did we would indeed be wrongdoers.'",
    "5:107": "If it then comes to light that the two of them have merited the allegation of wrongdoing, two others who have the most right to do so should take their place and swear by Allah: 'Our testimony is truer than their testimony. We have not committed perjury. If we had we would indeed be wrongdoers.'",
    "5:108": "That makes it more likely that they will give their evidence properly or be afraid that their oaths will be refuted by subsequent oaths. Have taqwa of Allah and listen carefully. Allah does not guide deviant people.",
    "5:109": "On the day Allah gathers the Messengers together and says, 'What response did you receive?' they will say, 'We do not know. You are the Knower of unseen things.'",
    "5:110": "Remember when Allah will say, \"Isa, son of Maryam, remember My blessing to you and to your mother when I reinforced you with the Purest Ruh so that you could speak to people in the cradle and when you were fully grown; and when I taught you the Book and Wisdom, and the Torah and the Nil: and when you created a bird-shape out of clay by My permission, and then breathed into it and it became a bird by My permission; and healed the blind and the leper by My permission; and when you brought forth the dead by My permission; and when I held back the tribe of Israel from you, when you brought them the Clear Signs and those of them who were kafir said, \"This is nothing but downright magic\";",
    "5:111": "and when I inspired the Disciples to have iman in Me and in My Messenger, they said, \"We have iman. Bear witness that we are Muslims.'\"",
    "5:112": "And when the Disciples said, \"Isa son of Maryam! Can your Lord send down a table to us out of heaven?' He said, 'Have taqwa of Allah if you are muminun!'",
    "5:113": "They said, 'We want to eat from it and for our hearts to be at peace and to know that you have told us the truth and to be among those who witness it.'",
    "5:114": "'Isa son of Maryam said, 'Allah, our Lord, send down a table to us out of heaven to be a feast for us, for the first and last of us, and as a Sign from You. Provide for us! You are the Best of Providers!'",
    "5:115": "Allah said, 'I will send it down to you but if anyone among you is kafir after that, I will punish him with a punishment the like of which I will not inflict on anyone else in all the worlds!'",
    "5:116": "And when Allah says, \"Isa son of Maryam! Did you say to people, \"Take me and my mother as gods besides Allah?'\" he will say, 'Glory be to You! It is not for me to say what I have no right to say! If I had said it, then You would have known it. You know what is in my self but I do not know what is in Your Self. You are the Knower of all unseen things.",
    "5:117": "I said to them nothing but what You ordered me to say: \"Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\" I was a witness against them as long as I remained among them, but when You took me back to You, You were the One watching over them. You are Witness of all things.",
    "5:118": "If You punish them, they are Your slaves. If you forgive them, You are the Almighty, the All-Wise.'",
    "5:119": "Allah will say, 'This is the Day when the sincerity of the sincere will benefit them. They will have Gardens with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever and ever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is the Great Victory.'",
    "5:120": "The kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in them belongs to Allah. He has power over all things.",
    "6:1": "Praise belongs to Allah who created the heavens and the earth and appointed darkness and light. Then those who are kafir make others equal to their Lord!",
    "6:2": "It is He who created you from clay and then decreed a fixed term, and another fixed term is specified with Him. Yet you still have doubts!",
    "6:3": "He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth. He knows what you keep secret and what you make public and He knows what you earn.",
    "6:4": "Not one of their Lord's Signs comes to them without their turning away from it.",
    "6:5": "They deny the truth each time it comes to them but news of what they were mocking will certainly reach them.",
    "6:6": "Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them which We had established on the earth far more firmly than We have established you? We sent down heaven upon them in abundant rain and after them.",
    "6:7": "Even if We were to send down a book to you on parchment pages and they were actually to touch it with their own hands, those who are kafir would still say, 'This is nothing but downright magic'",
    "6:8": "They say. 'Why has an angel not been sent down to him?' If We were to send down an angel, that would be the end of the affair and they would have no reprieve.",
    "6:9": "And if We had made him an angel We would still have made him a man, and further confused for them the very thing they are confused about!",
    "6:10": "Messengers before you were also mocked, but those who jeered were engulfed by what they mocked.",
    "6:11": "Say: 'Travel about the earth and see the final fate of the deniers.'",
    "6:12": "Say: 'To whom does everything in the heavens and earth belong?' Say: 'To Allah.' He has made mercy incumbent on Himself. He will gather you to the Day of Rising about which there is no doubt. As for those who have lost their own selves, they have no iman.",
    "6:13": "All that inhabits the night and the day belongs to Him. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",
    "6:14": "Say: 'Am I to take anyone other than Allah as my protector, the Bringer into Being of the heavens and the earth, He who feeds and is not fed?' Say: 'I am commanded to be the first of the Muslims,' and, 'Do not be among the idolaters.'",
    "6:15": "Say: 'I fear, were I to disobey my Lord, the punishment of a dreadful Day.'",
    "6:16": "Anyone from whom punishment is averted on that Day has been shown great mercy by Allah. That is the Clear Victory.",
    "6:17": "If Allah touches you with harm, none can remove it but Him. If He touches you with good, He has power over all things.",
    "6:18": "He is the Absolute Master over His slaves. He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware.",
    "6:19": "Say: 'What thing is greatest as a witness?' Say: 'Allah. He is Witness between me and you. This Qur'an has been revealed to me so that I may warn you by it, and anyone else it reaches. Do you then bear witness that there are other gods together with Allah?' Say: 'I do not bear witness.' Say: 'He is only One God, and I am free of all you associate with Him.'",
    "6:20": "Those We have given the Book recognise it as they recognise their own children. As for those who have lost their own selves, they have no iman.",
    "6:21": "Who could do greater wrong than someone who invents lies against Allah or denies His Signs? The wrongdoers are certainly not successful.",
    "6:22": "On the Day We gather them all together, We will say to those who associated others with Allah, 'Where are the partner-gods, for whom you made such claims?'",
    "6:23": "Then they will have no recourse except to say, 'By Allah, our Lord, we were not idolaters.'",
    "6:24": "See how they lie against themselves and how what they invented has forsaken them!",
    "6:25": "Some of them listen to you but We have placed covers on their hearts, preventing them from understanding it, and heaviness in their ears. Though they see every Sign, they still have no iman, so that when they come to you, disputing with you, those who are kafir say, 'This is nothing but the myths of previous peoples!'",
    "6:26": "They keep others from it and avoid it themselves. They are only destroying themselves but they are not aware of it.",
    "6:27": "If only you could see when they are standing before the Fire and saying, 'Oh! If only we could be sent back again, we would not deny the Signs of our Lord and we would be among the muminun.'",
    "6:28": "No, it is simply that what they were concealing before has been shown to them; and if they were sent back they would merely return to what they were forbidden to do. Truly they are liars.",
    "6:29": "They say, 'There is nothing but this life and we will not be raised again.'",
    "6:30": "If only you could see when they are standing before their Lord. He will say, 'Is this not the Truth?' They will say, 'Yes indeed, by our Lord!' He will say, 'Then taste the punishment for your kufr.'",
    "6:31": "Those who deny the meeting with Allah have lost, so that, when the Hour comes upon them suddenly, they will say, 'Alas for how we neglected it!' They will bear their burdens on their backs. How evil is what they bear!",
    "6:32": "The life of this world is nothing but a game and a diversion. The Next World is better for those who have taqwa. So will you not use your intellect?",
    "6:33": "We know that what they say distresses you. It is not that they are calling you a liar; the wrongdoers are just denying Allah's Signs.",
    "6:34": "Messengers before you were also denied but they were steadfast in the face of the denial and injury they suffered until Our help arrived. There is no changing the Words of Allah. And news of other Messengers has come to you.",
    "6:35": "If their turning away is hard on you, then go down a tunnel deep into the earth, if you can, or climb up a ladder into heaven, and bring them a Sign. If Allah had wanted to He would have gathered them all to guidance. So do not be among the ignorant.",
    "6:36": "Only those who can hear respond. As for the dead, Allah will raise them up, then to Him they will be returned.",
    "6:37": "They ask, 'Why has no Sign been sent down to him from his Lord?' Say, 'Allah has the power to send down a Sign.' But most of them do not know it.",
    "6:38": "There is no creature crawling on the earth or flying creature, flying on its wings, who are not communities just like yourselves - We have not omitted anything from the Book - then they will be gathered to their Lord.",
    "6:39": "Those who deny Our Signs are deaf and dumb in utter darkness. Allah misguides whoever He wills, and puts whoever He wills on a straight path.",
    "6:40": "Say: 'What do you think? If Allah's punishment were to come upon you or the Hour, would you call on other than Allah if you are being truthful?'",
    "6:41": "It is Him you call on and, if He wills, He will deliver you from whatever it was that made you call on Him; and you will forget what you associated with Him.",
    "6:42": "We sent Messengers to nations before you, and afflicted those nations with hardship and distress so that hopefully they would humble themselves.",
    "6:43": "If only they had humbled themselves when Our violent force came upon them! However, their hearts were hard and Shaytan made what they were doing seem attractive to them.",
    "6:44": "When they forgot what they had been reminded of, We opened up for them the doors to everything, until, when they were exulting in what they had been given, We suddenly seized them and at once they were in despair.",
    "6:45": "So the last remnant of the people who did wrong was cut off. Praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds!",
    "6:46": "Say: 'What do you think? If Allah took away your hearing and your sight and sealed up your hearts, what god is there, other than Allah, who could give them back to you?' Look how We vary the Signs, yet still they turn away!",
    "6:47": "Say: 'What do you think? If Allah's punishment were to come upon you suddenly by night or openly by day, would any but the wrongdoing people be destroyed?'",
    "6:48": "We do not send the Messengers except to bring good news and to give warning. As for those who have iman and put things right, they will feel no fear and will know no sorrow.",
    "6:49": "The punishment will fall on those who deny Our Signs because they were deviators.",
    "6:50": "Say: 'I do not say to you that I possess the treasuries of Allah, nor do I know the Unseen, nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I only follow what has been revealed to me.' Say: 'Are the blind the same as those who can see? So will you not reflect?'",
    "6:51": "Warn by it those who fear they will be gathered to their Lord, having no protector or intercessor apart from Him, so that hopefully they will have taqwa.",
    "6:52": "Do not chase away those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His Face. Their reckoning is in no way your responsibility and your reckoning is in no way their responsibility. Indeed if you did chase them away, you would be among the wrongdoers.",
    "6:53": "In this way We try some of them by means of others so that they say, 'Are these the people among us to whom Allah has shown His favour?' Does not Allah know best those who are thankful?",
    "6:54": "When those who have iman in Our Signs come to you, say, 'Peace be upon you!' Your Lord has made tawba and puts things right, He is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "6:55": "In that way We make the Signs plain so that you may clearly see the path of the evildoers.",
    "6:56": "Say: 'I am forbidden to worship those you call upon besides Allah.' Say: 'I do not follow your whims and desires. If I did I would go astray and not be among the guided.'",
    "6:57": "Say: 'I stand on a Clear Sign from my Lord and yet you have denied it. I do not have in my possession what you are in such haste to bring about. Jurisdiction over it belongs to Allah alone. He tells the truth and He is the Best of Deciders.'",
    "6:58": "Say: 'If I did have in my possession what you are in such haste to bring about, the affair between me and you would have been decided. Allah has greatest knowledge of the wrongdoers.'",
    "6:59": "The keys of the Unseen are in His possession. No one knows them but Him. He knows everything in the land and sea. No leaf falls without His knowing it. There is no seed in the darkness of the earth, and nothing",
    "6:60": "It is He who takes you back to Himself at night, while knowing the things you perpetrate by day, and then wakes you up again, so that a specified term may be fulfilled. Then you will return to Him. Then He will inform you about what you did.",
    "6:61": "He is the Absolute Master over His slaves. He sends angels to watch over you. Then when death comes to one of you, Our messengers take him, and they do not fail in their task.",
    "6:62": "Then they are returned to Allah, their Master, the Real. Jurisdiction belongs to Him alone and He is the Swiftest of Reckoners.",
    "6:63": "Say: 'Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and sea? You call on Him humbly and secretly: \"If you rescue us from this, we will truly be among the thankful.'\"",
    "6:64": "Say: 'Allah rescues you from it, and from every plight. Then you associate others with Him.'",
    "6:65": "Say: 'He possesses the power to send you punishment from above your heads or from beneath your feet, or to confuse you in sects and make you taste one another's violence.' Look how We vary the Signs so that hopefully they will understand.",
    "6:66": "Your people deny it and yet it is the Truth. Say: 'I am not here as your guardian. Every communication has its time, and you will certainly come to know.'",
    "6:67": "When you see people engrossed in mockery of Our Signs, turn from them until they start to talk of other things. And if Shaytan should ever cause you to forget, once you remember, do not stay sitting with the wrongdoers.",
    "6:68": "Their reckoning is in no way the responsibility of those who have taqwa. But remind them so that hopefully they themselves will gain taqwa.",
    "6:69": "Abandon those who have turned their deen into a game and a diversion and who have been deluded by the life of this world. Remind by it lest a person is delivered up to destruction for what he has earned with no protector or intercessor besides Allah. Were he to offer every kind of compensation, it would not be accepted from him. Such people are delivered up to destruction for what they have earned. They will have scalding water to drink and a painful punishment because they were kafir.",
    "6:70": "Say: 'Are we to call on something besides Allah which can neither help nor harm us, and to turn on our heels after Allah has guided us, like someone the shaytans have lured away in the earth, leaving him confused and stupefied, despite the fact that he has companions calling him to guidance, saying, \"Come with us!\"?' Say: 'Allah's guidance, that is true guidance. We are commanded to submit as Muslims to the Lord of all the worlds,",
    "6:71": "and to establish salat and have taqwa of Him. It is He to Whom you will be gathered.'",

    "6:73": "His speech is Truth. The Kingdom will be His on the Day the Trumpet is blown, the Knower of the Unseen and the Visible. He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware.",
    "6:74": "Remember when Ibrahim said to his father, Azar. 'Do you take idols as gods? I see that you and your people are clearly misguided.'",
    "6:75": "Because of that We showed Ibrahim the dominions of the heavens and the earth so that he might be one of the people of certainty.",
    "6:76": "When night covered him he saw a star and said, 'This is my Lord!' Then when it set he said, 'I do not love what sets.'",
    "6:77": "Then when he saw the moon come up he said, 'This is my Lord!' Then when it set he said, 'If my Lord does not guide me, I will be one of the misguided people.'",
    "6:78": "Then when he saw the sun come up he said, 'This is my Lord! This is greater!' Then when it set he said, 'My people, I am free of what you associate with Allah!",
    "6:79": "I have turned my face to Him Who brought the heavens and earth into being, a pure natural believer. I am not one of the mushrikun.'",
    "6:80": "His people argued with him. He said, 'Are you arguing with me about Allah when He has guided me? I have no fear of any partner you ascribe to Him unless my Lord should will such a thing to happen. My Lord encompasses all things in His knowledge so will you not pay heed?",
    "6:81": "Why should I fear what you have associated with Him when you yourselves apparently have no fear of associating partners with Allah for which He has sent down no authority to you? Which of the two parties is",
    "6:82": "Those who have iman and do not mix up their iman with any wrongdoing, they are the ones who are safe; it is they who are guided.'",
    "6:83": "This is the argument We gave to Ibrahim against his people. We raise in rank anyone We will. Your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.",
    "6:84": "We gave him Ishaq and Ya'qub, each of whom We guided. And before him We had guided Nuh. And among his descendants were Dawud and Sulayman, and Ayyub, Yusuf, Musa and Harun. That is how We recompense the good-doers.",
    "6:85": "And Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa and llyas. All of them were among the salihun.",
    "6:86": "And Isma'il, al-Yasa', Yunus and Lut. All of them We favoured over all beings.",
    "6:87": "And some of their forebears, descendants and brothers; We chose them and guided them to a straight path.",
    "6:88": "That is Allah's guidance. He guides by it those of His slaves He wills. If they had associated others with Him, nothing they did would have been of any use.",
    "6:89": "They are the ones to whom We gave the Book, Judgement and Prophethood. If these people reject it We have already entrusted it to a people who did not.",
    "6:90": "They are the ones Allah has guided, so be guided by their guidance. Say, 'I do not ask you for any wage for it. It is simply a reminder to all beings.'",
    "6:91": "They do not measure Allah with His true measure when they say, 'Allah would not send down anything to a mere human being.' Say: 'Who, then, sent down the Book which Musa brought as a Light and Guidance for the people?' You put it down on sheets of paper to display it while concealing much. You were taught things you did not know, neither you nor your forefathers. Say: 'Allah!' Then leave them engrossed in playing their games.",
    "6:92": "This is a Book We have sent down and blessed, confirming what came before it, so that you can warn the salat.",
    "6:93": "Who could do greater wrong than someone who invents lies against Allah or who says, 'It has been revealed to me,' when nothing has been revealed to him, or someone who says, 'I will send down the same as Allah has sent down'? If you could only see the wrongdoers in the throes of death when the angels are stretching out their hands, saying, 'Disgorge your own selves! Today you will be repaid with the punishment of humiliation for saying something other than the truth about Allah, and being arrogant about His Signs.'",
    "6:94": "'You have come to Us all alone just as We created you at first, leaving behind you everything We bestowed on you. We do not see your intercessors accompanying you. those you claimed were your partners with Allah. The link between you is cut. Those you made such claims for have forsaken you.'",
    "6:95": "Allah is He Who splits the seed and kernel. He brings forth the living from the dead, and produces the dead out of the living. That is Allah, so how are you perverted?",
    "6:96": "It is He Who splits the sky at dawn, and appoints the night as a time of stillness and the sun and moon as a means of reckoning. That is what the Almighty, the All-Knowing has ordained.",
    "6:97": "It is He Who has appointed the stars for you so you might be guided by them in the darkness of the land and sea. We have made the Signs clear for people who have knowledge.",
    "6:98": "It is He Who first produced you from a single self, then from a resting-place and a repository. We have",
    "6:99": "It is He Who sends down water from the sky from which We bring forth growth of every kind, and from that We bring forth the green shoots and from them We bring forth close-packed seeds, and from the spathes of the date palm date clusters hanging down, and gardens of grapes and olives and pomegranates, both similar and dissimilar. Look at their fruits as they bear fruit and ripen. There are Signs in that for people who have iman.",
    "6:100": "Yet they make the jinn co-partners with Allah when He created them! And they attribute sons and daughters to Him without any knowledge. Glory be to Him! He is far above what they describe!",
    "6:101": "He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How could He have a son when He has no wife? He created all things and He has knowledge of all things.",
    "6:102": "That is Allah, your Lord. There is no god but Him, the Creator of everything. So worship Him. He is responsible for everything.",

    "6:106": "Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord - there is no god but Him - and turn away from the idolaters.",
    "6:107": "If Allah had willed, they would not have associated anything with Him. We did not appoint you over them as their keeper and you are not set over them as their guardian.",
    "6:108": "Do not curse those they call upon besides Allah, in case that makes them curse Allah in animosity, without knowledge. In this way We make the actions of every nation seem attractive to them. Then they will return to their Lord, and He will inform them about what they did.",
    "6:109": "They have sworn by Allah with their most earnest oaths that if a Sign comes to them they will have iman in it. Say: The Signs are in Allah's control alone.' What will make you realise that even if a Sign did come, they would still not have iman?",
    "6:110": "We will overturn their hearts and sight, just as when they did not have iman in it at first, and We will abandon them to wander blindly in their excessive insolence.",
    "6:111": "Even if We sent down angels to them, and the dead spoke to them, and We gathered together everything in front of them right before their eyes, they would still not have iman unless Allah willed. The truth is that most of them are ignorant.",
    "6:112": "In this way We have appointed as enemies to every Prophet shaytans from both mankind and from the jinn, who inspire each other with delusions by means of specious words - if your Lord had willed, they would not have done it, so abandon them and all they fabricate -",
    "6:113": "so that the hearts of those who do not have iman in the akhira incline towards them and are pleased with them and perpetrate whatever they perpetrate.",
    "6:114": "'Am I to desire someone other than Allah as a judge when it is He who has sent down the Book to you clarifying everything?' Those We have given the Book know it has been sent down from your Lord with truth, so on no account be among the doubters.",
    "6:115": "The Words of your Lord are perfect in truthfulness and justice. No one can change His Words. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",
    "6:116": "If you obeyed most of those on earth, they would misguide you from Allah's Way. They follow nothing but conjecture. They are only guessing.",
    "6:117": "Your Lord knows best who is misguided from His Way and He knows best those who are guided.",
    "6:118": "Eat that over which the name of Allah has been mentioned, if you have iman in His Signs.",
    "6:119": "What is the matter with you that you do not eat that over which the name of Allah has been mentioned, when He has made clear to you what He has made haram for you except when you are forced to eat it? Many people lead themselves astray through their whims and desires without having any knowledge. Your Lord knows best those who overstep the limits.",
    "6:120": "Abandon wrong action, outward and inward. Those who commit wrong action will be repaid for what they perpetrated.",
    "6:121": "Do not eat anything over which the name of Allah has not been mentioned. To do so is sheer deviance. The shaytans inspire their friends to dispute with you. If you obeyed them you would then be idolaters.",
    "6:122": "Is someone who was dead and whom We brought to life, supplying him with a light by which to walk among people, the same as someone who is in utter darkness, unable to emerge from it? That is how what they were doing is made to seem attractive to the kafirun.",
    "6:123": "And likewise in every city We set up its greatest wrongdoers to plot in it. They plot against themselves alone, but they are not aware of it.",
    "6:124": "When a Sign comes to them, they say, We will not have iman until we have been given the same as the Allah and a severe punishment will strike those who did wrong for the plots that they concocted.",
    "6:125": "When Allah desires to guide someone, He expands his breast to Islam. When He desires to misguide someone, He makes his breast narrow and constricted as if he were climbing up into the sky. That is how Allah defiles those who have no iman.",
    "6:126": "This is the path of your Lord - straight. We have made the Signs clear for people who remember.",
    "6:127": "They will have the Abode of Peace with their Lord. He is their Protector because of what they have done.",
    "6:128": "On the Day We gather them all together: 'Company of jinn, you gained many followers among mankind.' And their friends among mankind will say, 'Our Lord, we benefited from one another, and now we have reached the term which You determined for us.' He will say, 'The Fire is your home. You will be in it timelessly, for ever, except as Allah wills. Your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.'",
    "6:129": "In that way We make the wrongdoers friends of one another because of what they have done.",
    "6:130": "Company of jinn and men! did not Messengers come to you from among yourselves relating My Signs to you and warning you of the encounter of this Day of yours? They will say, 'We testify against ourselves.' The life of this world deluded them and they will testify against themselves that they were kuffar.",
    "6:131": "That was because their Lord would never have destroyed the cities unjustly while their people were unaware.",
    "6:132": "All have ranks according to what they did. Your Lord is not unaware of what they do.",
    "6:133": "Your Lord is the Rich Beyond Need, the Possessor of Mercy. If He wanted, He could remove you and replace you with anything else He wanted to, just as He produced you from the descendants of another people.",
    "6:134": "What you are promised will come about and you can do nothing to prevent it.",
    "6:135": "Say: 'My people, do as you are doing, just as I am doing. You will certainly come to know who will have the best home in the end. The wrongdoers will certainly not be successful.'",
    "6:136": "They assign to Allah a share of the crops and livestock He has created, saying, 'This is for Allah,' - as they allege - 'and this is for our idols.' Their idols' share does not reach Allah whereas Allah's share reaches their idols! What an evil judgement they make!",
    "6:137": "In the same way their idols have made killing their children appear good to many of the idolaters, in order to destroy them and confuse them in their deen. If Allah had willed, they would not have done it; so abandon them and what they fabricate.",
    "6:138": "They say, These animals and crops are sacrosanct. No one may eat them except those we wish', - as they allege - and animals on whose backs it is forbidden to ride, and animals over which they do not mention Allah's name, inventing falsehood against Him. He will repay them for the things they have invented.",
    "6:139": "They say, 'What is in the wombs of these animals is exclusively for our men and haram for our wives. But if it is stillborn, they can share in it.' He will repay them for their false depiction. He is All-Wise, All- Knowing.",
    "6:140": "Those who kill their children foolishly without any knowledge and make what Allah has provided for them haram, inventing lies against Allah, such people are lost. They are misguided. They are not guided.",
    "6:141": "It is He who produces gardens, both cultivated and wild, and palm-trees and crops of diverse kinds, and olives and pomegranates, both similar and dissimilar. Eat of their fruits when they bear fruit and pay their due on the day of their harvest, and do not be profligate. He does not love the profligate.",
    "6:142": "And also animals for riding and for haulage and animals for slaughtering and for wool. Eat what Allah has provided for you and do not follow in the footsteps of Shaytan. He is an outright enemy to you.",
    "6:143": "There are eight in pairs: A pair of sheep and a pair of goats - Say: 'Is it the two males He has made haram, or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Tell me with knowledge if you are being truthful.'",
    "6:144": "And a pair of camels and a pair of cattle - Say: 'Is it the two males He has made haram, or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Were you then witnesses when Allah gave you this instruction?' Who could do greater wrong than someone who invents lies against Allah thus leading people astray without any knowledge? Allah does not guide the people of the wrongdoers.",
    "6:145": "Say: 'I do not find, in what has been revealed to me, any food it is haram to eat except for carrion, flowing blood, and pork - for that is unclean - or some deviance consecrated to other than Allah. But if anyone is forced to eat it, without desiring to or going to excess in it, your Lord is Ever-Forgiving, Most",
    "6:146": "We made haram for the Jews every animal with an undivided hoof, and in respect of cattle and sheep, We made their fat haram for them, except what is attached to their backs or guts or mixed up with bone. That is how We repaid them for their insolence. And We certainly speak the truth.",
    "6:147": "If they call you a liar, say: 'Your Lord possesses boundless mercy, but His violent force cannot be averted from the people of the evildoers.'",
    "6:148": "Those who associate others with Allah will say, 'If Allah had willed we would not have associated anything with Him, nor would our fathers; nor would we have made anything haram.' In the same way the people before them also lied until they felt Our violent force. Say: 'Do you have some knowledge you can produce for us? You are following nothing but conjecture. You are only guessing.'",
    "6:149": "Say: 'Allah's is the conclusive argument. If He had willed He could have guided every one of you.'",
    "6:150": "Say: 'Produce your witnesses to testify that Allah made this haram.' If they do testify, do not testify with them and do not follow the whims and desires of people who deny Our Signs, and who do not have iman in the Next World and make others equal to their Lord.",
    "6:151": "Say: 'Come and I will recite to you what your Lord has made haram for you': that you do not associate anything with Him; that you are good to your parents; that you do not kill your children because of poverty - We will provide for you and them; that you do not approach indecency - outward or inward; that you do not kill any person Allah has made inviolate - except with the right to do so. That is what He instructs you to do so that hopefully you will use your intellect.",
    "6:152": "And that you do not go near the property of orphans before they reach maturity - except in a good way; that you give full measure and full weight with justice - We impose on no self any more than it can bear; that you are equitable when you speak - even if a near relative is concerned; and that you fulfil Allah's contract. That is what He instructs you to do, so that hopefully you will pay heed.",
    "6:153": "This is My Path and it is straight, so follow it. Do not follow other ways or you will become cut off from His Way. That is what He instructs you to do, so that hopefully you will have taqwa.",
    "6:154": "Then We gave Musa the Book, complete and perfect for him who does good, elucidating everything, and a guidance and a mercy, so that hopefully they will have iman in their encounter with their Lord.",
    "6:155": "And this is a Book We have sent down and blessed, so follow it and have taqwa so that hopefully you will gain mercy.",
    "6:156": "So you cannot say: The Book was only sent down to the two groups before us and we were ignorant of their studies.'",
    "6:157": "Nor can you say: 'If the Book had been sent down to us, We would have been better guided than they were.' For a Clear Sign has come to you from your Lord, and guidance and mercy. Who could do greater wrong than someone who denies Allah's Signs and turns away from them? We will repay those who turn away from Our Signs with the worst kind of punishment because they turned away.",
    "6:158": "What are they waiting for but for the angels to come to them or for your Lord Himself to come, or for one of your Lord's Signs to come? On the day that one of your Lord's Signs does come, no iman which a self professes will be of any use to it if it did not have iman before and earn good in its iman. Say: 'Wait, then; We too are waiting.'",
    "6:159": "As for those who divide up their deen and form into sects, you have nothing whatsoever to do with them. Their affair will go back to Allah and then He will inform them about what they did.",
    "6:160": "Those who produce a good action will receive ten like it. But those who produce a bad action will only be repaid with its equivalent and they will not be wronged.",
    "6:161": "Say: 'My Lord has guided me to a straight path, a well-founded deen, the religion of Ibrahim, a man of pure natural belief. He was not one of the idolaters.'",
    "6:162": "Say: 'My salat and my rites, my living and my dying, are for Allah alone, the Lord of all the worlds,",
    "6:163": "Who has no partner. I am commanded to be like that and I am the first of the Muslims.'",
    "6:164": "Say: 'Am I to desire other than Allah as Lord when He is the Lord of all things?' What each self earns is for itself alone. No burden-bearer can bear another's burden. Then you will return to your Lord, and He will inform you regarding the things about which you differed.",
    "6:165": "It is He who appointed you khalifs on the earth and raised some of you above others in rank so He could test you regarding what He has given you. Your Lord is Swift in Retribution; and He is Ever-Forgiving, Most",
    "7:1": "Alif Lam Mim Sad.",
    "7:2": "It is a Book sent down to you - so let there be no constriction in your breast because of it so that you can give warning by it and as a reminder to the muminun.",
    "7:3": "Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord and do not follow any protectors apart from Him. How little you remember!",
    "7:4": "How many cities We have destroyed! Our violent force came down on them during the night, or while they were asleep during the day.",
    "7:5": "And their only utterance, when Our violent force came down upon them, was the cry: 'Truly we have been wrongdoers!'",
    "7:6": "We will question those to whom the Messengers were sent, and We will question the Messengers.",
    "7:7": "We will tell them about it with knowledge. We are never absent.",
    "7:8": "The weighing that Day will be the truth. As for those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful.",
    "7:9": "As for those whose scales are light, they are the ones who have lost their own selves because they wrongfully rejected Our Signs.",
    "7:10": "We have established you firmly on the earth and granted you your livelihood in it. What little thanks you show!",
    "7:11": "We created you and then formed you and then We said to the angels, 'Prostrate before Adam,' and they prostrated - except for Iblis. He was not among those who prostrated.",
    "7:12": "He said, 'What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you to?' He replied, 'I am better than him. You created me from fire and You created him from clay.'",
    "7:13": "He said, 'Descend from Heaven. It is not for you to be arrogant in it. So get out! You are one of the abased.'",
    "7:14": "He said, 'Grant me a reprieve until the day they are raised up.'",
    "7:15": "He said, 'You are one of the reprieved.'",
    "7:16": "He said, 'By Your misguidance of me, I will lie in ambush for them on your straight path.",
    "7:17": "Then I will come at them, from in front of them and behind them, from their right and from their left. You will not find most of them thankful.'",
    "7:18": "He said, 'Get out of it, reviled and driven out. As for those of them who follow you, I will fill up Hell with every one of you.'",
    "7:19": "'Adam, live in the Garden, you and your wife, and eat of it wherever you like. But do not go near this tree lest you become wrongdoers.'",
    "7:20": "Then Shaytan whispered to them, disclosing to them their private parts that had been concealed from them. He said, 'Your Lord has only forbidden you this tree lest you become angels or among those who live for ever.'",
    "7:21": "He swore to them, 'I am one of those who give you good advice.'",
    "7:22": "So he enticed them to do it by means of trickery. Then when they tasted the tree, their private parts were disclosed to them and they started stitching together the leaves of the Garden in order to cover themselves. Their Lord called out to them, 'Did I not forbid you this tree and say to you, \"Shaytan is an outright enemy to you\"?'",
    "7:23": "They said, 'Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. If you do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will be among the lost.'",
    "7:24": "He said, 'Go down from here as enemies to each other! You will have residence on the earth and enjoyment for a time.'",
    "7:25": "He said, 'On it you will live and on it die and from it you will be brought forth.'",
    "7:26": "Children of Adam! We have sent down clothing to you to conceal your private parts, and fine apparel, but the garment of taqwa - that is best! That is one of Allah's Signs, so that hopefully you will pay heed.",
    "7:27": "Children of Adam! do not let Shaytan tempt you into trouble as He expelled your parents from the Garden, stripping them of their covering and disclosing to them their private parts. He and his tribe see you from where you do not see them. We have made the shaytans friends of those who have no iman.",
    "7:28": "Whenever they commit an indecent act, they say, 'We found our fathers doing it and Allah commanded us to do it too.' Say: 'Allah does not command indecency. Do you say things about Allah you do not know?'",
    "7:29": "Say: 'My Lord has commanded justice. Stand and face Him in every mosque and call on Him, making your deen sincerely His. As He originated you, so you will return.' One group He guided; but another group got the misguidance they deserved. They took the shaytans as friends instead of Allah and thought that they were guided.",
    "7:30": "Children of Adam! wear fine clothing in every mosque and eat and drink but do not be profligate. He does not love the profligate.",
    "7:31": "Say: 'Who has forbidden the fine clothing Allah has produced for His slaves and the good kinds of provision?' Say: 'On the Day of Rising such things will be exclusively for those who had iman during their life in this world.' In this way We make the Signs clear for people who know.",
    "7:32": "Say: 'My Lord has forbidden indecency, both open and hidden, and wrong action, and unrightful tyranny, and associating anything with Allah for which He has sent down no authority, and saying things about Allah you do not know.'",
    "7:33": "Every nation has an appointed time. When their time comes, they cannot delay it a single hour or bring it forward.",
    "7:34": "Children of Adam! if Messengers come to you from among yourselves, recounting My Signs to you, those who have taqwa and put things right, will feel no fear and will know no sorrow.",
    "7:35": "But as for those who reject Our Signs and are arrogant regarding them, they are the Companions of the Fire, remaining in it timelessly, for ever.",
    "7:36": "Who could do greater wrong than someone who invents lies against Allah or denies His Signs? Such people's portion of the Book will catch up with them so that when Our messengers come to them to take them in death, saying, 'Where are those you called upon besides Allah?' they will say, 'They have forsaken us,' testifying against themselves that they were kuffar.",
    "7:37": "He will say, 'Enter the Fire together with the nations of jinn and men who have passed away before you.' Each time a nation enters, it will curse its sister nation, until, when they are all gathered together in it, the last of them will say to the first, 'Our Lord, those are the ones who misguided us, so give them a double punishment in the Fire.'",
    "7:38": "He will say, 'Each will receive double. But you do not know it.'",
    "7:39": "The first of them will say to the last, 'You are in no way superior to us so taste the punishment for what you earned.'",
    "7:40": "As for those who deny Our Signs and are arrogant regarding them, the Gates of Heaven will not be opened for them, and they will not enter the Garden until a camel goes through a needle's eye. That is how We repay the evildoers.",
    "7:41": "They will have Hell as a resting-place and covering layers on top of them. That is how We repay wrongdoers.",
    "7:42": "As for those who have iman and do right actions - We impose on no self any more than it can bear - they are the Companions of the Garden, remaining in it timelessly, for ever.",
    "7:43": "We will strip away any rancour in their hearts. Rivers will flow under them and they will say, 'Praise be to Allah who has guided us to this! We would not have been guided, had Allah not guided us. The Messengers of our Lord came with the Truth.' It will be proclaimed to them: 'This is your Garden which you have inherited for what you did.'",
    "7:44": "The Companions of the Garden will call out to the Companions of the Fire, 'We have found that what our Lord promised us is true. Have you found that what your Lord promised you is true?' They will say, 'Yes, we have!' Between them a herald will proclaim: 'May the curse of Allah be on the wrongdoers",
    "7:45": "those who bar access to the Way of Allah, desiring to make it crooked, and reject the next World.'",
    "7:46": "There will be a dividing wall between them and on the ramparts there will be men who recognise everyone by their mark. They will call out to the people of the Garden: 'Peace be upon you!' They will not enter it for all their ardent desire to do so.",
    "7:47": "When they turn their eyes towards the Companions of the Fire, they will say, 'Our Lord, do not place us with the people of the wrongdoers!'",
    "7:48": "The Companions of the Ramparts will call out to men they recognise by their mark, saying, 'What you amassed was of no use to you, nor was your arrogance.",
    "7:49": "Are these the people you swore that Allah's mercy would never reach?' 'Enter the Garden. You will feel no fear and know no sorrow.'",
    "7:50": "The Companions of the Fire will call out to the Companions of the Garden, 'Throw down some water to us or some of what Allah has given you as provision.' They will say, 'Allah has forbidden them to the kafirun:",
    "7:51": "those who took their deen as a diversion and a game, and were deluded by the life of the dunya.' Today We will forget them just as they forgot the encounter of this Day and denied Our Signs.",
    "7:52": "We have brought them a Book elucidating everything with knowledge, as guidance and a mercy for people who have iman.",
    "7:53": "What are they waiting for but its fulfilment? The Day its fulfilment occurs, those who forgot it before will say, 'The Messengers of our Lord came with the Truth. Are there any intercessors to intercede for us, or can we be sent back so that we can do something other than what we did?' They have lost their own selves and what they invented has forsaken them.",
    "7:54": "Your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then settled Himself firmly on the Throne. He covers the day with the night, each pursuing the other urgently; and the sun and moon and stars are subservient to His command. Both creation and command belong to Him. Blessed be Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.",
    "7:55": "Call on your Lord humbly and secretly. He does not love those who overstep the limits.",
    "7:56": "Do not corrupt the earth after it has been put right. Call on Him fearfully and eagerly. Allah's mercy is close to the good-doers.",
    "7:57": "He it is who sends out the winds, bringing advance news of His mercy, so that when they have lifted up the heavy clouds, We dispatch them to a dead land and send down water to it, by means of which We bring forth all kinds of fruit. In the same way We will bring forth the dead, so that hopefully you will pay heed.",
    "7:58": "Good land yields up its plants by its Lord's permission, but that which is bad only yields up scantily. In this way We vary the Signs for people who are thankful.",
    "7:59": "We sent Nuh to his people and he said, 'My people, worship Allah! You have no other god than Him. I fear for you the punishment of a dreadful Day.'",
    "7:60": "The ruling circle of his people said, 'We see you in flagrant error.'",
    "7:61": "He said, 'My people, I am not in error at all but rather am a Messenger from the Lord of all the worlds,",
    "7:62": "transmitting my Lord's Message to you and giving you good counsel, and I know from Allah what you do not know.",
    "7:63": "Or are you astonished that a reminder should come to you from your Lord by way of a man among you, to warn you and make you have taqwa so that hopefully you will gain mercy?'",
    "7:64": "But they denied him so We rescued him and those with him in the Ark. And We drowned the people who denied Our Signs. They were a blind people.",
    "7:65": "And to 'Ad We sent their brother Hud, who said, 'My people, worship Allah! You have no other god than Him. So will you not have taqwa?'",
    "7:66": "The ruling circle of those of his people who were kafir said, 'We consider you a fool and think you are a liar.'",
    "7:67": "He said, 'My people, I am by no means a fool, but rather am a Messenger from the Lord of all the worlds,",
    "7:68": "transmitting my Lord's Message to you, and I am a faithful counsellor to you.",
    "7:69": "Or are you astonished that a reminder should come to you from your Lord by way of a man among you in order to warn you? Remember when He appointed you successors to the people of Nuh, and increased you greatly in stature. Remember Allah's blessings, so that hopefully you will be successful.'",
    "7:70": "They said, 'Have you come to us to make us worship Allah alone and abandon what our fathers used to worship? Then bring us what you have promised us if you are telling the truth.'",
    "7:71": "He said, 'Punishment and anger have come down on you from your Lord. Do you argue with me regarding names which you and your forefathers invented and for which Allah has sent down no authority? Wait, then; I am waiting with you.'",
    "7:72": "So We rescued him and those with him by mercy from Us, and We cut off the last remnant of those who denied Our Signs and were not muminun.",
    "7:73": "And to Thamud We sent their brother Salih, who said, 'My people, worship Allah! You have no other god than Him. A Clear Sign has come to you from your Lord. This is the She-Camel of Allah as a Sign for you. Leave her alone to eat on Allah's earth and do not harm her in any way or a painful punishment will afflict you.",
    "7:74": "Remember when He appointed you successors to 'Ad and settled you in the land. You built palaces on its plains and carved out houses from the mountains. Remember Allah's blessings and do not go about the earth, corrupting it.'",
    "7:75": "The ruling circle of those of his people who were arrogant said to those who were oppressed - those among them who had iman - 'Do you know that Salih has been sent from his Lord?' They said, 'We have iman in what he has been sent with.'",
    "7:76": "Those who were arrogant said, 'We reject Him in whom you have iman.'",
    "7:77": "And they hamstrung the She-Camel, spurning their Lord's command, and said, 'Salih! Bring us what you have promised us if you are one of the Messengers.'",
    "7:78": "So the earthquake seized them and morning found them lying flattened in their homes.",
    "7:79": "He turned away from them and said, 'My people, I transmitted my Lord's message to you and gave you good counsel. However, you do not like good counsellors!'",
    "7:80": "And Lut, when he said to his people, 'Do you commit an obscenity not perpetrated before you by anyone in all the worlds?",
    "7:81": "You come with lust to men instead of women. You are indeed a depraved people.'",
    "7:82": "The only answer of his people was to say, 'Expel them from your city! They are people who keep themselves pure!'",
    "7:83": "So We rescued him and his family - except for his wife. She was one of those who stayed behind.",
    "7:84": "We rained down a rain upon them. See the final fate of the evildoers!",
    "7:85": "And to Madyan We sent their brother Shu'ayb who said, 'My people, worship Allah! You have no other god than Him. A Clear Sign has come to you from your Lord. Give full measure and full weight. Do not diminish people's goods. Do not cause corruption in the land after it has been put right. That is better for you if you are muminun.",
    "7:86": "Do not lie in wait on every pathway, threatening people, barring those who have iman from the Way of Allah, desiring to make it crooked. Remember when you were few and He increased your number: see the final fate of the corrupters!",
    "7:87": "There is a group of you who have iman in what I have been sent with and a group who do not, so be steadfast until Allah judges between us. He is the best of judges.'",
    "7:88": "The ruling circle of those of his people who were arrogant said, 'We will drive you out of our city, Shu'ayb, you and those who have iman along with you, unless you return to our religion.' He said, 'What, even though we detest it?",
    "7:89": "We would be inventing lies against Allah if we returned to your religion after Allah has saved us from it. We could never return to it unless Allah our Lord so willed. Our Lord encompasses everything in His knowledge. We have put our trust in Allah. Our Lord, judge between us and our people with truth. You are the best of judges.'",
    "7:90": "The ruling circle of those of his people who were kafir said, 'If you follow Shu'ayb, you will definitely be lost.'",
    "7:91": "So the earthquake seized them and morning found them lying flattened in their homes.",
    "7:92": "As for those who denied Shu'ayb, it was as if they had never lived there. It was the people who denied Shu'ayb who were the lost.",
    "7:93": "So he turned away from them and said, 'My people, I transmitted My Lord's message to you and gave you good counsel. Why should I grieve for a kafir people?'",
    "7:94": "We have never sent a Prophet to any city without seizing its people with hardship and distress so that hopefully they would be humble.",
    "7:95": "Then We gave them good in exchange for evil until they increased in number and said, 'Our forefathers too underwent both hardship and ease.' Then We seized them suddenly when they were not expecting it.",
    "7:96": "If only the people of the cities had had iman and taqwa, We would have opened up to them blessings from heaven and earth. But they denied the truth so We seized them for what they earned.",
    "7:97": "Do the people of the cities feel secure against Our violent force coming down on them in the night while they are asleep?",
    "7:98": "Or do the people of the cities feel secure against Our violent force coming down on them in the day while they are playing games?",
    "7:99": "Do they feel secure against Allah's devising? No one feels secure against Allah's devising except for those who are lost.",
    "7:100": "Is it not clear to those who have inherited the earth after these people that, if We wanted to, We could strike them for their wrong actions, sealing up their hearts so that they cannot hear?",
    "7:101": "These cities - We have given you news of them. Their Messengers came to them with Clear Signs, but they were never going to have iman in what they had previously rejected. That is how Allah seals up the hearts of the kuffar.",
    "7:102": "We did not find many of them worthy of their contract. We found most of them deviators.",
    "7:103": "And then, after them, We sent Musa with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his ruling circle but they wrongfully rejected them. See the final fate of the corrupters!",
    "7:104": "Musa said, 'Pharaoh! I am truly a Messenger from the Lord of all the worlds,",
    "7:105": "duty bound to say nothing about Allah except the truth. I have come to you with a Clear Sign from your Lord. So send the tribe of Israel away with me.'",
    "7:106": "He said, 'If you have come with a Clear Sign produce it if you are telling the truth.'",
    "7:107": "So He threw down his staff and there it was, unmistakably a snake.",
    "7:108": "And he drew out his hand and there it was, pure white to those who looked.",
    "7:109": "The ruling circle of Pharaoh's people said, 'This is certainly a skilled magician",
    "7:110": "who desires to expel you from your land, so what do you recommend?'",
    "7:111": "They said, 'Detain him and his brother and send out marshals to the cities,",
    "7:112": "to bring you all the skilled magicians.'",
    "7:113": "The magicians came to Pharaoh and they asked, 'Will we receive a reward if we are the winners?'",
    "7:114": "He said, 'Yes, and you will be among those brought near.'",
    "7:115": "They said, 'Musa, will you throw first or shall we be the ones to throw?'",
    "7:116": "He said, 'You throw.' And when they threw, they cast a spell on the people's eyes and caused them to eel great fear of them. They produced an extremely powerful magic.",
    "7:117": "We revealed to Musa, 'Throw down your staff.' And it immediately swallowed up what they had forged.",
    "7:118": "So the Truth took place and what they did was shown to be false.",
    "7:119": "They were defeated then and there, transformed into humbled men.",
    "7:120": "The magicians threw themselves down in prostration.",
    "7:121": "They said, 'We have iman in the Lord of all the worlds,",
    "7:122": "the Lord of Musa and Harun.'",
    "7:123": "Pharaoh said, 'Have you had iman in him before I authorised you to do so? This is just some plot you have concocted in the city to drive its people from it.",
    "7:124": "I will cut off your alternate hands and feet and then I will crucify every one of you.'",
    "7:125": "They said, 'We are returning to our Lord.",
    "7:126": "You are only avenging yourself on us because we had iman in our Lord's Signs when they came to us. Our Lord, pour down steadfastness upon us and take us back to You as Muslims.'",
    "7:127": "The ruling circle of Pharaoh's people said, 'Are you going to leave Musa and his people to cause corruption in the earth and abandon you and your gods?' He said, 'We will kill their sons and let their women live. We have absolute power over them!'",
    "7:128": "Musa said to his DeoDle. 'Seek heb in Allah and be steadfast. The earth belonas to Allah. He bequeathes it to any of His slaves He wills. The successful outcome is for those who have taqwa.'",
    "7:129": "They said, 'We suffered harm before you came to us and after you came to us.' He said, 'It may well be that your Lord is going to destroy your enemy and make you the successors in the land so that He can see how you behave.'",
    "7:130": "We seized Pharaoh's people with years of drought and scarcity of fruits so that hopefully they would pay heed.",
    "7:131": "Whenever a good thing came to them, they said, 'This is our due.' But if anything bad happened to them, they would blame their ill fortune on Musa and those with him. No indeed! Their ill fortune will be with Allah. But most of them did not know.",
    "7:132": "They said, 'No matter what kind of Sign you bring us to bewitch us, we will not have iman in you.'",
    "7:133": "So We sent down on them floods, locusts, lice, frogs and blood, Signs, clear and distinct, but they proved arrogant and were an evildoing people.",
    "7:134": "Whenever the plague came down on them they said, 'Musa, pray to your Lord for us by the contract He has with you. If you remove the plague from us, we will definitely have iman in you and send the tribe of Israel away with you.'",
    "7:135": "But when We removed the plague from them - for a fixed term which they fulfilled - they broke their word.",
    "7:136": "Then We took revenge on them and drowned them in the sea because they denied Our Signs and paid no attention to them.",
    "7:137": "And We bequeathed to the people who had been oppressed the easternmost part of the land We had blessed, and its westernmost part as well. The most excellent Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the tribe of Israel on account of their steadfastness. And We utterly destroyed what Pharaoh and his people made and the buildings they constructed.",
    "7:138": "We conveyed the tribe of Israel across the sea and they came upon some people who were devoting themselves to some idols which they had. They said. 'Musa, give us a god just as these people have gods.' He said, 'You are indeed an ignorant people.",
    "7:139": "What these people are doing is destined for destruction. What they are doing is purposeless.'",
    "7:140": "He said, 'Should I seek something other than Allah as a god for you when He has favoured you over all other beings?'",
    "7:141": "Remember when We rescued you from Pharaoh's people who were inflicting an evil punishment on you, killing your sons and letting your women live. In that there was a terrible trial from your Lord.",
    "7:142": "We set aside thirty nights for Musa and then completed them with ten, so the appointed time of his Lord was forty nights in all. Musa said to his brother Harun, 'Be my khalif among my people. Keep order and do not follow the way of the corrupters.'",
    "7:143": "When Musa came to Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, 'My Lord, show me Yourself so that I may look at You!' He said, 'You will not see Me, but look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, then you will see Me.' But when His Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, He crushed it flat and tawba to You and I am the first of the muminun!'",
    "7:144": "He said, 'Musa, I have chosen you over all mankind for My Message and My Word. Take what I have given you and be among the thankful.'",
    "7:145": "We wrote about everything for him on the Tablets as an admonition and making all things clear. 'Seize hold of it vigorously and command your people to adopt the best in it. I will show you the home of the deviators!'",
    "7:146": "I will divert from My Signs all those who are arrogant in the earth without any right. If they see every Sign, they will not believe in it. If they see the way of right guidance, they will not take it as a way. But if they see the way of error, they will take that as a way. That is because they denied Our Signs and paid no attention to them.",
    "7:147": "As for those who denied Our Signs and the encounter of the Next World, their actions will come to nothing. Will they be repaid except for what they did?",
    "7:148": "After he left, Musa's people adopted a calf made from their ornaments, a form which made a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could not speak to them or guide them to any way? They adopted it and so they were wrongdoers.",
    "7:149": "When they took full stock of what they had done and saw they had been misled, they said, 'If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us, we will certainly be among the lost.'",
    "7:150": "When Musa returned to his people in anger and great sorrow, he said, 'What an evil thing you did in my absence after I left! Did you want to hasten your Lord's command?' He threw down the Tablets and seized hold of his brother's head, dragging him towards him. Harun said, 'Son of my mother, The people oppressed wrongdoing people.'",
    "7:151": "He said, 'My Lord, forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your mercy. You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.'",
    "7:152": "As for those who adopted the Calf, anger from their Lord will overtake them together with abasement in the life of the dunya. That is how we repay the purveyors of falsehood.",
    "7:153": "But as for those who do evil actions and then subsequently make tawba and have iman, in that case your Lord is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "7:154": "When Musa's anger abated he picked up the Tablets and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for all of them who feared their Lord.",
    "7:155": "Musa chose seventy men from his people for Our appointed time and when the earthquake seized them he said, 'My Lord, if You had willed, You could have destroyed them previously and me as well. Would you destroy us for what the fools among us did? It was only a trial from You by which You misguided those You willed and guided those You willed. You are our Protector so forgive us and have mercy on us. You are the Best of Forgivers.",
    "7:156": "Prescribe good for us in this world and the Next World. We have truly turned to You.' He said, 'As for My punishment, I strike with it anyone I will. My mercy extends to all things but I will prescribe it for those who have taqwa and pay zakat, and those who believe in Our Signs:",
    "7:157": "those who follow the Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet, whom they find written down with them in the Torah and the Gospel, commanding them to do right and forbidding them to do wrong, making good things halal for them and bad things haram for them, relieving them of their heavy loads and the chains which were around them. Those who have iman in him and honour him and help him, and follow the Light that has been sent down with him, they are the ones who are successful.'",
    "7:158": "Say: 'Mankind! I am the Messenger of Allah to you all, of Him to whom the kingdom of the heavens and earth belongs. There is no god but Him. He gives life and causes to die.' So have iman in Allah and His you will be guided.'",
    "7:159": "Among the people of Musa there is a group who guide by the truth and act justly in accordance with it.",
    "7:160": "We divided them up into twelve tribes - communities. We revealed to Musa, when his people asked him for water: 'Strike the rock with your staff.' Twelve fountains flowed out from it and all the people knew their drinking place. And We shaded them with clouds and sent down manna and quails to them: 'Eat of the good things We have provided you with.' They did not wrong Us; rather it was themselves they wronged.",
    "7:161": "When they were told: 'Live in this town and eat of it wherever you like and say, \"Relieve us of our burdens!\" and enter the gate prostrating. Your mistakes will be forgiven you. We will grant increase to good- doers.'",
    "7:162": "But those of them who did wrong substituted words other than those they had been given. So We sent a plague on them from heaven for their wrongdoing.",
    "7:163": "Ask them about the town which was by the sea when they broke the Sabbath - when their fish came to them near the surface on their Sabbath day but did not come on the days which were not their Sabbath. In this way We put them to the test because they were deviators.",
    "7:164": "When a group of them said, 'Why do you rebuke a people whom Allah is going to destroy or severely punish?' they said, 'So that we have an excuse to present to your Lord, and so that hopefully they will gain taqwa.'",
    "7:165": "Then when they forgot what they had been reminded of, We rescued those who had forbidden the evil and seized those who did wrong with a harsh punishment because they were deviators.",
    "7:166": "When they were insolent about what they had been forbidden to do, We said to them, 'Be apes, despised, cast out!'",
    "7:167": "Then your Lord announced that He would send against them until the Day of Rising people who would inflict an evil punishment on them. Your Lord is Swift in Retribution. And He is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "7:168": "And We divided them into nations in the earth. Some of them are righteous and some are other than that. We tried them with good and evil so that hopefully they would return.",
    "7:169": "An evil generation has succeeded them, inheriting the Book, taking the goods of this lower world, and saying, 'We will be forgiven.' But if similar goods come to them again they still take them. Has not a covenant been made with them in the Book, that they should only say the truth about Allah and have they not studied what is in it? The Final Abode is better for those who have taqwa. Will you not use your intellect?",
    "7:170": "As for those who hold fast to the Book and establish salat, We will not let the wage of the righteous go to waste.",
    "7:171": "When We uprooted the mountain, lifting it above them like a canopy, and they thought it was about to fall on them: 'Seize hold vigorously of what We have given you and remember what is in it, so that hopefully you will have taqwa.'",
    "7:172": "When your Lord took out all their descendants from the loins of the children of Adam and made them testify against themselves 'Am I not your Lord?' they said, 'We testify that indeed You are!' Lest you say on the Day of Rising, 'We knew nothing of this.'",
    "7:173": "Or lest you say, 'Our forefathers associated others with Allah before our time, and we are merely descendants coming after them. So are You going to destroy us for what those purveyors of falsehood did?'",
    "7:174": "That is how We make the Signs clear so that hopefully they will return.",
    "7:175": "Recite to them the tale of him to whom We gave Our Signs, but who then cast them to one side and Shaytan caught up with him. He was one of those lured into error.",
    "7:176": "If We had wanted to, We would have raised him up by them. But he gravitated towards the earth and pursued his whims and base desires. His metaphor is that of a dog: if you chase it away, it lolls out its tongue and pants, and if you leave it alone, it lolls out its tongue and pants. That is the metaphor of those who deny Our Signs. So tell the story so that hopefully they will reflect.",
    "7:177": "How evil is the metaphor of those who deny Our Signs. It is themselves that they have badly wronged.",
    "7:178": "Whoever Allah guides is truly guided; but those He misguides are the lost.",
    "7:179": "We created many of the jinn and mankind for Hell. They have hearts they do not understand with. They have eyes they do not see with. They have ears they do not hear with. Such people are like cattle. No, they are even further astray! They are the unaware.",
    "7:180": "To Allah belong the Most Beautiful Names, so call on Him by them and abandon those who desecrate His Names. They will be repaid for what they did.",
    "7:181": "Among those We have created there is a community who guide by the Truth and act justly according to it.",
    "7:182": "But as for those who deny Our Signs, We will lead them, step by step, into destruction from where they do not know.",
    "7:183": "I will give them more time. My strategy is sure.",
    "7:184": "Have they not reflected? Their companion is not mad. He is only a clear warner.",
    "7:185": "Have they not looked into the dominions of the heavens and the earth and what Allah has created, and seen that it may well be that their appointed time is near? In what discourse after this will they have iman?",
    "7:186": "If Allah misguides people, no one can guide them. We will abandon them to wander blindly in their excessive insolence.",
    "7:187": "They will ask you about the Hour: when is it due? Say: 'Knowledge of it rests with my Lord alone. He alone will reveal it at its proper time. It hangs heavy in the heavens and the earth. It will not come upon you except suddenly.' They will ask you as if you had full knowledge of it. Say: 'Knowledge of it rests with Allah alone. But most people do not know that.'",
    "7:188": "Say: 'I possess no power to help or harm myself, except as Allah wills. If I had had knowledge of the Unseen, I would have sought to gain much good and no evil would have touched me. I am only a warner and a bringer of good news to people who have iman.'",
    "7:189": "It is He who created you from a single self and made from him his spouse so that he might find repose in her. Then when he covered her she bore a light load and carried it around. Then when it became heavy they called on Allah, their Lord, 'If You grant us a healthy child, we will be among the thankful!'",
    "7:190": "Then when He granted them a healthy, upright child, they associated what He had given them with Him. But Allah is far above what they associate with Him!",
    "7:191": "Do they make things into partner-gods which cannot create anything and are themselves created;",
    "7:192": "which are not capable of helping them and cannot even help themselves?",
    "7:193": "If you call them to guidance they will not follow you. It makes no difference if you call them or stay silent.",
    "7:194": "Those you call on besides Allah are slaves just like yourselves. Call on them and let them respond to you if you are telling the truth.",
    "7:195": "Do they have legs they can walk with? Do they have hands they can grasp with? Do they have eyes they can see with? Do they have ears they can hear with? Say: 'Call on your partner-gods and try all your wiles against me and grant me no reprieve.",
    "7:196": "My Protector is Allah who sent down the Book. He takes care of the righteous.'",
    "7:197": "Those you call on besides Him are not capable of helping you. They cannot even help themselves.",
    "7:198": "If you call them to guidance, they do not hear. You see them looking at you, yet they do not see.",
    "7:199": "Make allowances for people, command what is right, and turn away from the ignorant.",
    "7:200": "If an evil impulse from Shaytan provokes you, seek refuge in Allah. He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.",
    "7:201": "As for those who have taqwa, when they are bothered by visitors from Shaytan, they remember and immediately see clearly.",
    "7:202": "But as for their brothers, the visitors lead them further into error. And they do not stop at that!",
    "7:203": "If you do not bring them a Sign, they say, 'Why have you not come up with one?' Say, 'I follow only what has been revealed to me from my Lord.' This is clear insight from your Lord, and guidance and mercy, for people who have iman.",
    "7:204": "When the Qur'an is recited listen to it and be quiet so that hopefully you will gain mercy.",
    "7:205": "Remember your Lord in yourself humbly and fearfully, without loudness of voice, morning and evening. Do not be one of the unaware.",
    "7:206": "Those who are in the presence of your Lord do not consider themselves too great to worship Him. They glorify His praise and they prostrate to Him.",
    "8:1": "They will ask you about booty. Say: 'Booty belongs to Allah and the Messenger. So have taqwa of Allah and put things right between you. Obey Allah and His Messenger if you are muminun.'",
    "8:2": "The muminun are those whose hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned, whose iman is increased when His Signs are recited to them, and who put their trust in their Lord;",
    "8:3": "those who establish salat and give of what We have provided for them.",
    "8:4": "They are in truth the muminun. They have high ranks with their Lord and forgiveness and generous provision.",
    "8:5": "Just as your Lord brought you out from your house with truth, even though a group of the muminun disliked it,",
    "8:6": "arguing with you about the Truth after it had been made clear as though they were being driven to their death with open eyes.*",
    "8:7": "When Allah promised you that one of the two parties would be yours and you would have liked it to have been the unarmed one, whereas Allah desired to verify the Truth by His words and to cut off the last remnant of the kafirun.",
    "8:8": "This was so that He might verify the Truth and nullify the false, even though the evildoers hate that.",
    "8:9": "Remember when you called on your Lord for help and He responded to you: 'I will reinforce you with a thousand angels riding rank after rank.'",
    "8:10": "Allah only did this to give you good news and that so your hearts would be at rest. Victory comes from no one but Allah. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.",
    "8:11": "And when He overcame you with sleep, making you feel secure, and sent you down water from heaven to purify you and remove the taint of Shaytan from you, and to fortify your hearts and make your feet firm.",
    "8:12": "And when your Lord revealed to the angels, 'I am with you so make those who have iman firm. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who are kafir, so strike their necks and strike all their finger joints!'",
    "8:13": "This was because they were hostile to Allah and His Messenger. If anyone is hostile to Allah and His",
    "8:14": "That is your reward, so taste it. The kafirun will also have the punishment of the Fire.",
    "8:15": "You who have iman! when you encounter those who are kafir advancing in massed ranks into battle, do not turn your backs on them.",
    "8:16": "Anyone who turns his back on them that day, unless he is withdrawing to rejoin the fight or withdrawing to support another group, brings Allah's anger down upon himself. His refuge is Hell. What an evil destination!",
    "8:17": "You did not kill them; it was Allah who killed them; and you did not throw, when you threw; it was Allah who threw: so He might test the muminun with this excellent trial from Him. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
    "8:18": "That is your reward. Allah always confounds the schemes of the kuffar.",
    "8:19": "If it was a decisive victory you were seeking, that victory has clearly been won. If you desist, it will better for you; but if you return, We also will return. Your troops will not help you at all, however many they are. Allah is with the muminun.",
    "8:20": "You who have iman! obey Allah and His Messenger. And do not turn away from him when you are able to hear.",
    "8:21": "Do not be like those who say, 'We hear,' when they do not hear.",
    "8:22": "The worst of beasts in Allah's sight are the deaf and dumb who have no intellect.",
    "8:23": "If Allah knew of any good in them, He would have made them able to hear. But even if He had made them able to hear, they would still have turned away.",
    "8:24": "You who have iman! respond to Allah and to the Messenger when He calls you to what will bring you to life! Know that Allah intervenes between a man and his heart and that you will be gathered to Him.",
    "8:25": "Be fearful of trials which will not afflict solely those among you who do wrong. Know that Allah is severe in retribution.",
    "8:26": "When you were few and oppressed in the land, afraid that the people would snatch you away, He gave you refuge and supported you with His help and provided you with good things so that hopefully you would be thankful.",
    "8:27": "You who have iman! do not betray Allah and His Messenger, and do not knowingly betray your trusts.",
    "8:28": "Know that your wealth and children are a trial and that there is an immense reward with Allah.",
    "8:29": "You who have iman! if you have taqwa of Allah, He will give you discrimination and erase your bad actions from you and forgive you. Allah's favour is indeed immense.",
    "8:30": "When those who are kafir were plotting against you to imprison you or kill you or expel you: they were plotting and Allah was plotting, but Allah is the Best of Plotters.",
    "8:31": "When Our Signs are recited to them, they say, 'We have already heard all this. If we wanted, we could say the same thing. This is nothing but the myths of previous peoples.'",
    "8:32": "And they say, 'Allah, if this is really the truth from You, rain down stones on us out of heaven or send a painful punishment down on us.'",
    "8:33": "Allah would not punish them while you were among them. Allah would not punish them as long as they sought forgiveness.",
    "8:34": "But why should Allah not punish them now when they bar access to the Masjid al-Haram? They are not its guardians. Only people who have taqwa can be its guardians. But most of them do not know that.",
    "8:35": "Their prayer at the House is nothing but whistling and clapping. So taste the punishment because you were kafir!",
    "8:36": "Those who are kafir spend their wealth barring access to the Way of Allah. They will spend it; then they will regret it; then they will be overthrown. Those who are kafir will be gathered into Hell,",
    "8:37": "so that Allah can sift the bad out from the good, and pile the bad on top of one another, heaping them all together, and tip them into Hell. They are the lost.",
    "8:38": "Say to those who are kafir that if they stop, they will be forgiven what is past; but if they return to it, they have the pattern of previous peoples in the past.",
    "8:39": "Fight them until there is no more fitna and the deen is Allah's alone. If they stop, Allah sees what they do,",
    "8:40": "but if they turn away, know that Allah is your Master, the Best of Masters, and the Best of Helpers!",
    "8:41": "Know that when you take any booty a fifth of it belongs to Allah, and to the Messenger, and to close relatives, orphans, the very poor and travellers, if you believe in Allah and in what We sent down to Our slave on the Day of Discrimination, the day the two groups met - Allah has power over all things -",
    "8:42": "when you were on the nearer slope, and they were on the further slope and the caravan was lower down than you. If you had made an appointment with them you would have broken the appointment. However, it happened so that Allah could settle a matter whose result was preordained: so that those who died would die with clear proof, and those who lived would live with clear proof. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",

But when the two parties came in sight of one another, he turned right round on his heels saying, 'I wash my hands of you. I see what you do not see. I fear Allah. Allah is severe in retribution.'",
    "8:49": "And when the hypocrites and those with sickness in their hearts said, 'These people have been deluded by their deen.' But those who put their trust in Allah will find Allah to be Almighty, All-Wise.",
    "8:50": "If only you could see when the angels take back those who were kafir at their death, beating their faces and their backs: 'Taste the punishment of the Burning!",
    "8:51": "That is for what you did. Allah does not wrong His slaves.'",
    "8:52": "Such was the case with Pharaoh's people and those before them. They rejected Allah's Signs so Allah seized them for their wrong actions. Allah is Strong, Severe in Retribution.",
    "8:53": "That is because Allah would never change a blessing He has conferred on a people until they had changed what was in themselves. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
    "8:54": "Such was the case with Pharaoh's people and those before them. They denied their Lord's Signs so We destroyed them for their wrong actions. We drowned Pharaoh's people. All of them were wrongdoers.",
    "8:55": "The worst of animals in the sight of Allah are those who are kafir and do not have iman,",
    "8:56": "those with whom you make a treaty and who then break it every time. They have no taqwa.",
    "8:57": "So if you come upon such people in war, make a harsh example of them to deter those coming after them so that hopefully they will pay heed.",
    "8:58": "If you fear treachery on the part of a people, revoke your treaty with them mutually. Allah does not love treacherous people.",
    "8:59": "Do not imagine that those who are kafir have got ahead. They are quite powerless.",
    "8:60": "Arm yourselves against them with all the firepower and cavalry you can muster, to terrify the enemies of Allah and your enemies, and others besides them whom you do not know. Allah knows them. Anything you spend in the Way of Allah will be repaid to you in full. You will not be wronged.",
    "8:61": "If they incline to peace, you too incline to it, and put your trust in Allah. He is the All-Hearing, the All- Knowing.",
    "8:62": "If they intend to deceive you, Allah is enough for you. It is He who supported you with His help and with the muminun,",
    "8:63": "and unified their hearts. Even if you had spent everything on the earth, you could not have unified their hearts. But Allah has unified them. He is Almighty, All-Wise.",
    "8:64": "O Prophet! Allah is enough for you, and for the muminun who follow you.",
    "8:65": "O Prophet! spur on the muminun to fight. If there are twenty of you who are steadfast, they will overcome two hundred; and if there are a hundred of you, they will overcome a thousand of those who are kafir, because they are people who do not understand.",
    "8:66": "Now Allah has made it lighter on you, knowing there is weakness in you. If there are a hundred of you who are steadfast, they will overcome two hundred; and if there are a thousand of you, they will overcome two thousand with Allah's permission. Allah is with the steadfast.",
    "8:67": "It is not fitting for a Prophet to take captives until he has let much blood in the land. You desire the goods of this world, whereas Allah desires the Next World. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.",
    "8:68": "Were it not for a prior decree which had already proceeded from Allah, a terrible punishment would have afflicted you on account of what you took.",
    "8:69": "So make full use of any booty you have taken which is halal and good; and have taqwa of Allah. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "8:70": "O Prophet! say to those you are holding prisoner, 'If Allah knows of any good in your hearts, He will give you something better than what has been taken from you and forgive you.' Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most",
    "8:71": "But if they mean to betray you, they have already previously betrayed Allah, so He has given you power over them. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "8:72": "Those who have iman and have made hiira and done jihad with their wealth and themselves in the Way of Allah, and those who have given refuge and help, they are the friends and protectors of one another. But as for those who have iman but have not made hijra, you are not in any way responsible for their protection until they make hijra. But if they ask you for help in respect of the deen, it is your duty to help them, except against people you have a treaty with. Allah sees what you do.",
    "8:73": "Those who are kafir are the friends and protectors of one another. If you do not act in this way there will be turmoil in the land and great corruption.",
    "8:74": "Those who have iman and have made hijra and done jihad in the Way of Allah and those who have given refuge and help, they are the true muminun. They will have forgiveness and generous provision.",
    "8:75": "Those who have iman and make hijra later on and accompany you in doing jihad, they also are of your number. But blood relations are closer to one another in the Book of Allah. Allah has knowledge of all things.",
    "9:1": "An announcement to those mushrikun you have a general treaty with that Allah and His Messenger are free of them:",
    "9:2": "'You may travel about in the land for four months and know that you cannot thwart Allah and that Allah will humiliate the kafirun.'",
    "9:3": "A proclamation from Allah and His Messenger to mankind on the day of the greater pilgrimage: 'Allah is free of the idolaters, as is His Messenger. If you make tawba, it will be better for you. But if you turn your backs, know that you cannot thwart Allah.' Give the kuffar the news of a painful punishment -",
    "9:4": "except those among the idolaters you have treaties with, who have not then broken their treaties with you in any way, nor granted assistance to anyone against you. Honour their treaties until their time runs out. Allah loves those who have taqwa.",
    "9:5": "Then, when the sacred months are over, kill the idolaters wherever you find them, and seize them and besiege them and lie in wait for them on every road. If they make tawba and establish salat and pay zakat, let them go on their way. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "9:6": "If any of the idolaters ask you for protection, give them protection until they have heard the words of Allah. Then convey them to a place where they are safe. That is because they are a people who do not know.",
    "9:7": "How could any of the idolaters possibly have a treaty with Allah and with His Messenger, except for those you made a treaty with at the Masjid al-Haram? As long as they are straight with you, be straight with them. Allah loves those who have taqwa.",
    "9:8": "How indeed! For if they get the upper hand over you, they will respect neither kinship nor treaty. They please you with their mouths but their hearts belie their words. Most of them are deviators.",
    "9:9": "They have sold Allah's Signs for a paltry price, and they have barred access to His Way. What they have done is truly evil.",
    "9:10": "They respect neither kinship nor treaty where a mumin is concerned. They are the people who overstep the limits.",
    "9:11": "But if they make tawba and establish salat and pay zakat, they are your brothers in the deen. We make the Signs clear for people who have knowledge.",
    "9:12": "If they break their oaths after making their treaty and defame your deen, then fight the leaders of kufr - their oaths mean nothing - so that hopefully they will stop.",
    "9:13": "Will you not fight a people who have broken their oaths and resolved to expel the Messenger, and who initiated hostilities against you in the first place? Is it them you fear? Allah has more right to your fear if you are",
    "9:14": "Fight them! Allah will punish them at your hands, and disgrace them and help you against them, and heal the hearts of those who have iman.",
    "9:15": "He will remove the rage from their hearts. Allah turns to anyone He wills. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "9:16": "Or did you suppose that you would be left without Allah knowing those of you who have done jihad and who have not taken anyone as their intimate friends besides Allah and His Messenger and the muminun? Allah is aware of what you do.",
    "9:17": "It is not for the idolaters to frequent the mosques of Allah, bearing witness against themselves of their kufr. They are the ones whose actions will come to nothing. They will be in the Fire timelessly, for ever.",
    "9:18": "The mosques of Allah should only be frequented by those who have iman in Allah and the Last Day and establish salat and pay zakat, and fear no one but Allah. They are the ones most likely to be guided.",
    "9:19": "Do you make the giving of water to the pilgrims and looking after the Masjid al-Haram the same as having iman in Allah and the Last Day and doing jihad in the Way of Allah? They are not equal in the sight of Allah. Allah does not guide wrongdoing people.",
    "9:20": "Those who have iman and make hijra and do jihad in the Way of Allah with their wealth and themselves have a higher rank with Allah. They are the ones who are victorious.",
    "9:21": "Their Lord gives them the good news of His mercy and good pleasure and Gardens where they will enjoy everlasting delight,",
    "9:22": "remaining in them timelessly, for ever and ever. Truly there is an immense reward with Allah.",
    "9:23": "You who have iman, do not befriend your fathers and brothers if they prefer kufr to iman. Those among you who do befriend them are wrongdoers.",
    "9:24": "Say: 'If your fathers or your sons or your brothers or your wives or your tribe, or any wealth you have acquired, or any business you fear may slump, or any house which pleases you, are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger and doing jihad in His Way, then wait until Allah brings about His command. Allah does not guide people who are deviators.'",
    "9:25": "Allah has helped you on many occasions, including the Day of Hunayn* when your great numbers delighted you but did not help you in any way, and the earth seemed narrow to you for all its great breadth, and you turned your backs.",
    "9:26": "Then Allah sent down His serenity on His Messenger and on the muminun, and sent down troops you could not see, and punished those who were kafir. That is how the kuffar are repaid.",
    "9:27": "Then after that Allah will turn to anyone He wills. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "9:28": "You who have iman! the idolaters are unclean, so after this year they should not come near the Masjid al- Haram. If you fear impoverishment, Allah will enrich you from His bounty if He wills. Allah is All-Knowing, All- Wise.",
    "9:29": "Fight those of the people who were given the Book who do not have iman in Allah and the Last Day and who do not make haram what Allah and His Messenger have made haram and do not take as their deen the deen of Truth, until they pay the jizya with their own hands in a state of complete abasement.",
    "9:30": "The Jews say, \"Uzayr is the son of Allah,' and the Christians say, 'The Messiah is the son of Allah.' That is what they say with their mouths, copying the words of those who were kafir before. Allah fight them! How perverted they are!",
    "9:31": "They have taken their rabbis and monks as lords besides Allah, and also the Messiah, son of Maryam. Yet they were commanded to worship only one God. There is no god but Him! Glory be to Him above anything they associate with Him!",
    "9:32": "They desire to extinguish Allah's Light with their mouths. But Allah refuses to do other than perfect His Light, even though the kafirun detest it.",
    "9:33": "It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the Deen of Truth to exalt it over every other deen, even though the idolaters detest it.",
    "9:34": "You who have iman! many of the rabbis and monks devour people's property under false pretences and bar people from access to the Way of Allah. As for those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend it in the Way of Allah, give them the news of a painful punishment",
    "9:35": "on the Day it is heated up in the fire of Hell and their foreheads, sides and backs are branded with it: This is what you hoarded for yourselves, so taste what you were hoarding!'",
    "9:36": "There have been twelve months with Allah in the Book of Allah, from the day He first created the heavens and earth. Four of them are haram. That is the True Deen. So do not wrong one another during them. However, fight the idolaters totally just as they fight you totally, and know that Allah is with those who have taqwa.",
    "9:41": "Go out to fight, whatever your circumstances or desires, and do jihad with your wealth and yourselves in the Way of Allah. That is better for you if you only knew.",
    "9:42": "If it had been a case of easy gains and a short journey, they would have followed you, but the distance was too great for them. They will swear by Allah: 'Had we been able to, we would have gone out with you.' They are destroying their own selves. Allah knows that they are lying.",
    "9:43": "Allah pardon you! Why did you excuse them until it was clear to you which of them were telling the truth and until you knew the liars?",
    "9:44": "Those who have iman in Allah and the Last Day do not ask you to excuse them from doing jihad with their wealth and themselves. Allah knows the people who have taqwa.",
    "9:45": "Only those who do not have iman in Allah and the Last Day ask you to excuse them. Their hearts are full of doubt and in their doubt they waver to and fro.",
    "9:46": "If they had really desired to go out, they would have made proper preparations for it, but Allah was averse to their setting out so He held them back and they were told: 'Stay behind with those who stay behind.'",
    "9:47": "If they had gone out among you, they would have added nothing to you but confusion. They would have scurried about amongst you seeking to cause conflict between you, and among you there are some who would have listened to them. Allah knows the wrongdoers.",
    "9:48": "They have already tried to cause conflict before, and turned things completely upside down for you, until the truth came and Allah's command prevailed even though they detested it.",
    "9:49": "Among them are there some who say, 'Give me permission to stay. Do not put temptation in my way.' Have they not fallen into that very temptation? Hell hems in the kafirun.",
    "9:50": "If good happens to you it galls them. If a mishap occurs to you, they say, 'We made our preparations in advance,' and they turn away rejoicing.",
    "9:51": "Say: 'Nothing can happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us. He is Our Master. It is in Allah that the muminun should put their trust.'",
    "9:52": "Say: 'What do you await for us except for one of the two best things?* But what we await for you is for Allah to inflict a punishment on you either directly from Himself or at our hands. So wait, we are waiting with you!'",
    "9:53": "Say: 'Whether you give readily or reluctantly, it will not be accepted from you. You are people who are deviators.'",
    "9:54": "Nothing prevents what they give from being accepted from them but the fact that they have rejected Allah and His Messenger, and that they only come to salat lethargically, and that they only give reluctantly.",
    "9:55": "Do not let their wealth and children impress you. Allah merely wants to punish them by them during their life in this world and for them to expire while they are kuffar.",
    "9:56": "They swear by Allah that they are of your number, but they are not of your number. Rather, they are people who are scared.",
    "9:57": "If they could find a bolt-hole, cave or burrow, they would turn and scurry away into it.",
    "9:58": "Among them there are some who find fault with you concerning the zakat. If they are given some of it. they are pleased but if they are not given any, they are angry.",
    "9:59": "If only they had been pleased with what Allah and His Messenger had given them and had said, 'Allah is enough for us. Allah will give us of His bounty as will His Messenger. It is to Allah that we make our plea.'",
    "9:60": "Zakat is for: the poor, the destitute, those who collect it, reconciling people's hearts, freeing slaves, those in debt, spending in the Way of Allah, and travellers. It is a legal obligation from Allah. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "9:61": "Among them are some who insult the Prophet, saying he is only an ear. Say, 'An ear of good for you, believing in Allah and believing in the muminun, and a mercy for those among you who have iman.' As for those who insult the Messenger of Allah, they will have a painful punishment.",
    "9:62": "They swear to you by Allah in order to please you, but it would be more fitting for them to please Allah and His Messenger if they are muminun.",
    "9:63": "Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger, will have the Fire of Hell, remaining in it timelessly, for ever? That is the great disgrace.",
    "9:64": "The hypocrites are afraid that a sura may be sent down about them, informing them of what is in their hearts. Say: 'Go on mocking! Allah will expose everything you are afraid of.'",
    "9:65": "If you ask them they will say, 'We were only joking and playing around.' Say: 'Would you make a mockery of Allah and of His Signs and of His Messenger?",
    "9:66": "Do not try to excuse yourselves. You have become kafir after having iman. If one group of you is pardoned, another group will be punished for being evildoers.'",
    "9:67": "The men and women of the hypocrites are as bad as one another. They command what is wrong and forbid what is right and keep their fists tightly closed. They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them. The hypocrites are deviators.",
    "9:68": "Allah has promised the men and women of the hypocrites and kafirun the Fire of Hell, remaining in it timelessly, for ever. It will suffice them. Allah has cursed them. They will have everlasting punishment.",
    "9:69": "Like those before you who had greater strength than you and more wealth and children. They enjoyed their portion; so enjoy your portion as those before you enjoyed theirs. You have plunged into defamation as they plunged into it. The actions of such people come to nothing in this world or the Next World. They are the lost.",
    "9:70": "Has the news of those who came before them not reached them the people of Nuh and 'Ad and Thamud, and the people of Ibrahim and the inhabitants of Madyan and the overturned cities? Their Messengers brought them the Clear Signs. Allah did not wrong them; rather they wronged themselves.",
    "9:71": "The men and women of the muminun are friends of one another. They command what is right and forbid what is wrong, and establish salat and pay zakat, and obey Allah and His Messenger. They are the people on whom Allah will have mercy. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.",
    "9:72": "Allah has promised the men and women of the muminun Gardens with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever, and fine dwellings in the Gardens of Eden. And Allah's good pleasure is even greater. That is the great victory.",
    "9:73": "O Prophet, do jihad against the kafirun and hypocrites and be harsh with them. Their shelter will be Hell. What an evil destination!",
    "9:74": "They swear by Allah that they said nothing, but they definitely spoke the word of kufr and returned to kufr after their Islam. They planned something which they did not achieve and they were vindictive for no other reason than that Allah and His Messenger had enriched them from His bounty. If they were to make tawba, it would be better for them. But if they turn away, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the Next World, and they will not find any protector or helper on the earth.",
    "9:75": "Among them there were some who made an agreement with Allah: 'If He gives us of His bounty we will definitely give sadaqa and be among the righteous.'",
    "9:76": "But when He does give them of His bounty they are tight-fisted with it and turn away,",
    "9:77": "so He has punished them by putting hypocrisy in their hearts until the day they meet Him because they failed Allah in what they promised Him and because they lied.",
    "9:78": "Do they not know that Allah knows their secrets and their private talk, and that Allah is the Knower of all unseen things?",
    "9:79": "As for the people who find fault with those muminun who give sadaqa spontaneously, and with those who can find nothing to give but their own effort, and deride them, Allah derides them. They will have a painful punishment.",
    "9:80": "You can ask forgiveness for them, or not ask forgiveness for them. Even if you asked forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah still would not forgive them. That is because they have rejected Allah and His",
    "9:81": "Those who were left behind were glad to stay behind the Messenger of Allah. They did not want to do jihad with their wealth and themselves in the Way of Allah. They said, 'Do not go out to fight in the heat.' Say: The Fire of Hell is much hotter, if they only understood.'",
    "9:82": "Let them laugh little and weep much, in repayment for what they have earned.",
    "9:83": "If Allah returns you to a group of them, and they ask you for permission to go out, say, 'You will never go out with me, nor will you ever fight an enemy with me. You were happy to stay behind the first time, so stay behind with those who are left behind.'",
    "9:84": "Never pray over any of them who die or stand at their graves. They rejected Allah and His Messenger and died as deviators.",
    "9:85": "Do not let their wealth and their children impress you. Allah merely wants to punish them by them in this world, and for them to expire while they are kafirun.",
    "9:86": "When a sura is sent down saying: 'Have iman in Allah and do jihad together with His Messenger,' those among them with wealth will ask you to excuse them, saying, 'Let us remain with those who stay behind.'",
    "9:87": "They are pleased to be with those who stay behind. Their hearts have been stamped so they do not understand.",
    "9:88": "But the Messenger and those who have iman along with him have done jihad with their wealth and with themselves. They are the people who will have the good things. They are the ones who are successful.",
    "9:89": "Allah has prepared Gardens for them with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever. That is the great victory.",
    "9:90": "The desert arabs came with their excuses asking for permission to stay, and those who lied to Allah and His Messenger stayed behind. A painful punishment will afflict those among them who are kafir.",
    "9:91": "Nothing is held against the weak and sick nor against those who find nothing to spend, provided they are true to Allah and His Messenger - there is no way open against good-doers, Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most",
    "9:92": "nor is anything held against those who, when they came to you for you to provide them with mounts and you said, 'I cannot find anything on which to mount you,' turned away with their eyes overflowing with tears, overcome by grief at having nothing to give.",
    "9:93": "There are only grounds against those who ask you for permission to stay when they are rich. They were pleased to be among those who were left behind. Allah has sealed up their hearts so they do not know.",
    "9:94": "They will make excuses to you when you return to them. Say: 'Do not make excuses, we will not believe you. Allah has already informed us about you. Allah will see your actions, as will His Messenger. Then you will be returned to the Knower of the Unseen and the Visible, and He will inform you regarding what you did.'",
    "9:95": "They will swear to you by Allah when you return to them, so that you leave them alone. Leave them alone, then! They are filth. Their shelter will be Hell as repayment for what they did.",
    "9:96": "They will swear to you to make you pleased with them, but even if you are pleased with them, Allah is certainly not pleased with deviant people.",
    "9:97": "The desert arabs are more obdurate in kufr and hypocrisy and more likely not to know the limits which Allah has sent down to His Messenger. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "9:98": "Among the desert arabs there are some who regard what they give as an imposition and are waiting for your fortunes to change. The evil turn of fortune will be theirs! Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
    "9:99": "And among the desert arabs there are some who have iman in Allah and the Last Day and regard what they give as something which will bring them nearer to Allah and to the prayers of the Messenger. It does indeed bring them near. Allah will admit them into His mercy. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "9:100": "The forerunners - the first of the Muhajirun and the Ansar - and those who have followed them in doing good: Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. He has prepared Gardens for them with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever and ever. That is the great victory.",
    "9:101": "Some of the desert Arabs around you are hypocrites and some of the people of Madina are obdurate in their hypocrisy. You do not know them but We know them. We will punish them twice over and then they will be returned to a terrible punishment.",
    "9:102": "But others have acknowledged their wrong actions and mixed a right action with another which is wrong. It may well be that Allah will turn towards them. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "9:103": "Take zakat from their wealth to purify and cleanse them and pray for them. Your prayers bring relief to them. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
    "9:104": "Do they not know that Allah accepts tawba from His slaves and acknowledges their zakat, and that Allah is the Ever-Returning, the Most Merciful?",
    "9:105": "Say: 'Act, for Allah will see your actions, and so will His Messenger and the muminun. You will be returned to the Knower of the Unseen and the Visible and He will inform you regarding what you did.'",
    "9:106": "And others are left awaiting Allah's command as to whether He will punish them or turn to them. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "9:107": "As for those who have set up a mosque, causing harm and out of kufr, to create division between the 'We only desired the best.' But Allah bears witness that they are truly liars.",
    "9:108": "Do not ever stand in it. A mosque founded on taqwa from the first day has a greater right for you to stand in it. In it there are men who love to purify themselves. Allah loves those who purify themselves.",
    "9:109": "Who is better: someone who founds his building on taqwa of Allah and His good pleasure, or someone who founds his building on the brink of a crumbling precipice so that it collapses with him into the Fire of Hell? Allah does not love wrongdoers.",
    "9:110": "The buildings they have built will not cease to be a bone of contention in their hearts, until their hearts are cut to shreds. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "9:111": "Allah has bought from the muminun their selves and their wealth in return for the Garden. They fight in the Way of Allah and they kill and are killed. It is a promise binding on Him in the Torah, the Injil and the Qur'an and who is truer to his contract than Allah? Rejoice then in the bargain you have made. That is the great victory.",
    "9:112": "Those who make tawba, those who worship, those who praise, those who fast, those who bow, those who prostrate, those who command the right, those who forbid the wrong, those who preserve the limits of Allah: give good news to the muminun.",
    "9:113": "It is not right for the Prophet and those who have iman to ask forgiveness for the idolaters - even if they are close relatives - after it has become clear to them that they are the Companions of the Blazing Fire.",
    "9:114": "Ibrahim would not have asked forgiveness for his father but for a promise he made to him, and when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he renounced him. Ibrahim was tender-hearted and forbearing.",
    "9:115": "Allah would never misguide a people after guiding them until He had made it clear to them how to have taqwa. Allah has knowledge of all things.",
    "9:116": "Allah is He to whom the kingdom of the heavens and earth belongs. He gives life and causes to die. You have no protector or helper besides Allah.",
    "9:117": "Allah has turned towards the Prophet, and the Muhajirun and the Ansar, those who followed him at the 'time of difficulty', after the hearts of a group of them had almost deviated. Then He turned towards them - He is All-Gentle, Most Merciful to them -",
    "9:118": "and also towards the three who were left behind,* so that when the earth became narrow for them, for all its great breadth, and their own selves became constricted for them and they realised that there was no refuge from Allah except in Him, He turned to them so that they might turn to Him. Allah is the Ever-Returning, the Most Merciful.",
    "9:119": "You who have iman! have taqwa of Allah and be with the truly sincere.",
    "9:120": "It was not for people of Madina, and the desert arabs around them, to remain behind the Messenger of Allah nor to prefer themselves to him. That is because no thirst or weariness or hunger will afflict them in the Way of Allah, nor will they take a single step to infuriate the kafirun. nor secure any gain from the enemy. without a right action being written down for them because of it. Allah does not let the wage of the good-doers go to waste.",
    "9:121": "Nor will they give away any amount, whether large or small, nor will they cross any valley, without it being written down for them so that Allah can recompense them for the best of what they did.",
    "9:122": "It is not necessary for the muminun to go out all together. If a party from each group of them were to go out so they could increase their knowledge of the deen they would be able to notify their people when they returned to them so that hopefully they would take warning!",
    "9:123": "You who have iman! fight those of the kuffar who are near to you and let them find you implacable. Know that Allah is with those who have taqwa.",
    "9:124": "Each time a sura is sent down there are some among them who say, 'Which of you has this increased in iman?' As for those who have iman, it increases them in iman and they rejoice at it.",
    "9:125": "But as for those with sickness in their hearts, it adds defilement to their defilement, and they die kuffar.",
    "9:126": "Do they not see that they are tried once or twice in every year? But still they do not turn back. They do not pay heed.",
    "9:127": "Each time a sura is sent down, they look at one another, implying, 'Can anyone see you?' Then they turn away. Allah has turned their hearts away because they are people who do not understand.",
    "9:128": "A Messenger has come to you from among yourselves. Your suffering is distressing to him; he is deeply concerned for you; he is gentle and merciful to the muminun.",
    "9:129": "But if they turn away, say, 'Allah is enough for me. There is no god but Him. I have put my trust in Him. He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.'",
    "10:1": "Alif Lam Ra Those are the Signs of the Wise Book.",
    "10:2": "Do people find it so surprising that We should reveal to a man among them: 'Warn mankind and give good news to those who have iman that they are on a sure footing with their Lord'? The kafirun say, This is downright magic!'",
    "10:3": "Your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established Himself firmly on the Throne. He directs the whole affair. No one can intercede except with His permission. That is Allah your Lord, so worship Him. Will you not pay heed?",
    "10:4": "Each and every one of you will return to Him. Allah's promise is true. He brings creation out of nothing and then regenerates it so that he can repay with justice those who had iman and did right actions. Those who were kafir will have a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment because of their kufr.",
    "10:5": "It is He who appointed the sun to give radiance, and the moon to give light, assigning it phases so you would know the number of years and the reckoning of time. Allah did not create these things except with truth. We make the Signs clear for people who know.",
    "10:6": "In the alternation of night and day and what Allah has created in the heavens and the earth there are Signs for people who have taqwa.",
    "10:7": "As for those who do not expect to meet Us and are content with the life of the dunya and at rest in it, and those who are heedless of Our Signs,",
    "10:8": "their shelter will be the Fire because of what they earned.",
    "10:9": "But as for those who have iman and do right actions, their Lord will guide them by their iman. Rivers will flow under them in Gardens of Delight.",

    "10:11": "If Allah were to hasten evil for people the way they try to hasten good, their term would already have been completed for them. We abandon those who do not expect to meet Us to wander blindly in their excessive insolence.",
    "10:12": "When harm touches man, he calls on Us, lying on his side or sitting down or standing up. Then when We remove the harm from him he carries on as if he had never called on Us when the harm first touched him. In that way We make what they have done appear good to the profligate.",
    "10:13": "We destroyed generations before you when they did wrong. Their Messengers brought them the Clear Signs, but they were never going to have iman. That is how We repay evildoers.",
    "10:14": "Then We appointed you after them to be khalifs on the earth so We might observe how you would act.",
    "10:15": "When Our Clear Signs are recited to them, those who do not expect to meet Us say, 'Bring a Qur'an other than this one or change it.' Say: 'It is not for me to change it of my own accord. I follow nothing except what is revealed to me. I fear, were I to disobey my Lord, the punishment of a Dreadful Day.'",
    "10:16": "Say: 'Had Allah so wished, I would not have recited it to you nor would He have made it known to you. I lived among you for many years before it came. Will you not use your intellect?'",
    "10:17": "Who could do greater wrong than someone who invents lies against Allah or denies His Signs? Evildoers are certainly not successful.",
    "10:18": "They worship, instead of Allah, what can neither harm them nor help them, saying, 'These are our intercessors with Allah.' Say: 'Would you inform Allah of something about which He does not know either in the heavens or on the earth?' May He be glorified and exalted above what they associate with Him!",
    "10:19": "Mankind was only one community but then they differed, and had it not been for a prior Word from your Lord, they would already have been judged in respect of the differences between them.",

    "10:21": "When We let people taste mercy after hardship has afflicted them, immediately they plot against Our Signs. Say: 'Allah is swifter at plotting.' Your plotting is recorded by Our messengers.",
    "10:22": "It is He who conveys you on both land and sea so that when some of you are on a boat, running before a fair wind, rejoicing at it, and then a violent squall comes upon them and the waves come at them from every side and they realise there is no way of escape, they call on Allah, making their deen sincerely His: 'If You rescue us from this, we will truly be among the thankful.'",
    "10:23": "But then, when He does rescue them, they become rebellious in the earth without any right to do so. then you will return to Us and We will inform you about what you did.",
    "10:24": "The metaphor of the life of this world is that of water which We send down from the sky, and which then loveliest and takes on its fairest guise and its people think they have it under their control, Our command comes upon it by night or day and We reduce it to dried-out stubble, as though it had not been flourishing just the day before! In this way We make Our Signs clear for people who reflect.",
    "10:25": "Allah calls to the Abode of Peace and He guides whom He wills to a straight path.",
    "10:26": "Those who do good will have the best and more! Neither dust nor debasement will darken their faces. They are the Companions of the Garden, remaining in it timelessly, for ever.",
    "10:27": "But as for those who have earned bad actions - a bad action will be repaid with one the like of it. Debasement will darken them. They will have no one to protect them from Allah. It is as if their faces were covered by dark patches of the night. Those are the Companions of the Fire, remaining in it timelessly, for ever.",
    "10:28": "On the Day We gather them all together, We will say then to those who associated others with Allah, 'To your place, you and your partner-gods!' Then We will sift them out, and their partner-gods will say, 'It was not us you worshipped.",
    "10:29": "Allah is a sufficient witness between us and you. We were unaware of your worship.'",
    "10:30": "Then and there every self will be tried for what it did before. They will be returned to Allah, their Master, the Real, and what they invented will abandon them.",
    "10:31": "Say: 'Who provides for you out of heaven and earth? Who controls hearing and sight? Who brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living? Who directs the whole affair?' They will say, 'Allah.' Say, 'So will you not have taqwa?'",
    "10:32": "That is Allah, your Lord, the Truth, and what is there after truth except misguidance? So how have you been distracted?",
    "10:33": "In that way the Word of your Lord is realised against those who are deviators, in that they do not have iman.",
    "10:34": "Say: 'Can any of your partner-gods bring creation out of nothing and then regenerate it?' Say: 'Allah brings creation out of nothing and then regenerates it. So how have you been perverted?'",
    "10:35": "Say: 'Can any of your partner-gods guide to the truth?' Say: 'Allah guides to the truth. Who has more right to be followed - He who guides to the truth, or he who cannot guide unless he is guided? What is the matter with you? How do you reach your judgement?'",
    "10:36": "Most of them follow nothing but conjecture. Conjecture is of no use whatsoever against the truth. Allah",
    "10:37": "This Qur'an could never have been devised by any besides Allah. Rather it is confirmation of what came before it and an elucidation of the Book which contains no doubt from the Lord of all the worlds.",
    "10:38": "Do they say, 'He has invented it'? Say: 'Then produce a sura like it and call on anyone you can besides Allah if you are telling the truth.'",
    "10:39": "No, the fact is that they have denied something which their knowledge does not embrace and the the final fate of the wrongdoers!",
    "10:40": "Among them there are some who have iman in it and some who do not. Your Lord best knows the corrupters.",
    "10:41": "If they deny you, say, 'I have my actions and you have your actions. You are not responsible for what I do and I am not responsible for what you do.'",
    "10:42": "Among them there are some who listen to you. But can you make the deaf hear even though they cannot understand?",
    "10:43": "Among them there are some who look at you. But can you guide the blind, even though they cannot see?",
    "10:44": "Allah does not wrong people in any way; rather it is people who wrong themselves.",
    "10:45": "On the day We gather them together - when it will seem if they had tarried no more than an hour of a single day - they will recognise one another. Those who denied the meeting with Allah will have lost. They were not guided.",
    "10:46": "Whether We show you something of what We have promised them or take you back to Us, they will still return to Us. Then Allah will be witness against what they are doing.",
    "10:47": "Every nation has a Messenger and when their Messenger comes everything is decided between them justly. They are not wronged.",

    "10:49": "Say: 'I possess no power to harm or help myself except as Allah wills. Every nation has an appointed time. When their appointed time comes, they cannot delay it a single hour or bring it forward.'",
    "10:50": "Say: 'What do you think? If His punishment came upon you by night or day, what part of it would the evildoers then try to hasten?'",
    "10:51": "And then, when it actually comes about: 'Now do you have iman in it? It was this that you were trying to hasten!'",
    "10:52": "Then it will be said to those who did wrong, 'Taste the punishment of eternity! Have you been repaid for anything other than what you earned?'",
    "10:53": "They will ask you to tell them if this is true. Say: 'Yes indeed, by my Lord, it certainly is true and you can do nothing to prevent it.'",
    "10:54": "If every self that did wrong possessed everything on earth, it would offer it as a ransom. They will show remorse when they see the punishment. Everything will be decided between them justly. They will not be wronged.",
    "10:55": "Yes, everything in the heavens and earth belongs to Allah. Yes, Allah's promise is true but most of them do not know it.",
    "10:56": "He gives life and causes to die and you will be returned to Him.",
    "10:57": "Mankind! admonition has come to you from your Lord and also healing for what is in the breasts and guidance and mercy for the muminun.",
    "10:58": "Say: 'It is the favour of Allah and His mercy that should be the cause of their rejoicing. That is better than anything they accumulate.'",
    "10:59": "Say: 'What do you think about the things Allah has sent down to you as provision which you have then designated as halal and haram?' Say: 'Has Allah given you authority to do this or are you inventing lies against Allah?'",
    "10:60": "What will those who invent lies against Allah think on the Day of Rising? Allah shows favour to mankind but most of them are not thankful.",
    "10:61": "You do not engage in any matter or recite any of the Qur'an or do any action without Our witnessing you while you are occupied with it. Not even the smallest speck eludes your Lord, either on earth or in heaven. Nor is there anything smaller than that, or larger, which is not in a Clear Book.",

    "10:66": "Yes, indeed! Everyone in the heavens and everyone on the earth belongs to Allah. Those who call on something other than Allah are not really following their partner-gods. They are only following conjecture. They are only guessing.",
    "10:67": "It is He who appointed the night for you, so that you could rest in it, and the day for seeing. There are certainly Signs in that for people who listen.",
    "10:68": "They say, 'Allah has a son.' Glory be to Him! He is the Rich Beyond Need. Everything in the heavens and everything on the earth belongs to Him. Have you authority to say this or are you saying about Allah what you do not know?",
    "10:69": "Say: 'People who invent lies against Allah will not be successful.'",
    "10:70": "There is the enjoyment of this world. Then they will return to Us. Then We will let them taste the terrible punishment because they were kafir.",
    "10:71": "Recite to them the story of Nuh when he said to his people, 'My people, if my standing here and reminding you of Allah's Signs has become too much for you to bear, know that I have put my trust in Allah. So decide, you and your gods, on what you want to do and be open about it. Do with me whatever you decide and do not keep me waiting.",

    "10:73": "But they denied him so We rescued him, and all those with him, in the Ark and We made them the successors and We drowned the people who denied Our Signs. See the final fate of those who were warned!",
    "10:74": "Then after him We sent Messengers to their people, and they brought them the Clear Signs, but they were never going to have iman in something which they had previously denied. That is how We seal up the hearts of those who overstep the limits.",
    "10:75": "Then after them We sent Musa and Harun with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his ruling circle, but they were arrogant and were a people of evildoers.",
    "10:76": "When the truth came to them from Us, they said, 'This is downright magic!'",
    "10:77": "Musa said, 'Do you say to the truth when it comes to you, \"This is magic\"? Magicians are not successful.'",

    "10:83": "No one had iman in Musa except for a few of his people out of fear that Pharaoh, and the elders, would persecute them. Pharaoh was high and mighty in the land. He was one of the profligate.",

    "10:85": "They said, 'We have put our trust in Allah. Our Lord, Do not make us a target for this wrongdoing people,",
    "10:86": "and rescue us, by Your mercy, from this kafir people!'",
    "10:87": "We revealed to Musa and his brother: 'Settle your people in houses in Egypt and make your houses places of worship and establish salat and give good news to the muminun.'",
    "10:88": "Musa said, 'Our Lord, You have given Pharaoh and his ruling circle finery and wealth in the life of this world, Our Lord, so that they may be misguided from Your Way. Our Lord, obliterate their wealth and harden their hearts so that they do not have iman until they see the painful punishment.'",
    "10:89": "He said, 'Your request is answered, so go straight and do not follow the way of those who have no knowledge.'",
    "10:90": "We brought the tribe of Israel across the sea and Pharaoh and his troops pursued them out of tyranny and enmity. Then, when he was on the point of drowning, he said, 'I believe that there is no god but Him in whom the tribe of Israel believe. I am one of the Muslims.'",
    "10:91": "'What, now! When previously you rebelled and were one of the corrupters?",
    "10:92": "Today We will preserve your body so you can be a Sign for people who come after you. Surely many people are heedless of Our Signs.'",
    "10:93": "We settled the tribe of Israel in a noble place and gave them good things as provision. They did not differ until knowledge came to them. Your Lord will decide between them on the Day of Rising regarding the things about which they differed.",

    "10:98": "How is it that there has never been a city that had iman, whose iman then brought it benefit, except the people of Yunus? When they had iman We removed from them the punishment of disgrace in the life of this world and We let them have enjoyment for a time.",
    "10:99": "If your Lord had willed, all the people on the earth would have had iman. Do you think you can force people to be muminun?",

    "11:46": "He said, 'Nuh, he is definitely not of your family. He is someone whose action was not righteous. Do not, therefore, ask Me for something about which you have no knowledge. I admonish you lest you should be among the ignorant.'",
    "11:47": "He said, 'My Lord, I seek refuge with You from asking You for anything about which I have no knowledge. If You do not forgive me and have mercy on me, I will be among the lost.'",
    "11:48": "It was said, 'Nuh, descend with peace from Us and with blessings on you and on the nations which will issue from those who are with you. But there are nations to whom we will give enjoyment and then a painful punishment from Us will afflict them.'",
    "11:49": "That is some of the news of the Unseen which We reveal to you. Neither you nor your people knew it before this time. So be steadfast. The best end result is for those who have taqwa.",

    "11:51": "My people! I do not ask you for any wage for it. My wage is the responsibility of Him who brought me into being. So will you not use your intellect?",
    "11:52": "My people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord and then make tawba to Him. He will send heaven down to you in abundant rain, and increase you with strength upon strength. Do not turn away as evildoers.'",
    "11:53": "They said, 'Hud, you have not brought us any clear sign. We will not forsake our gods for what you say. We do not believe you.",
    "11:54": "We only say that one of our gods has driven you mad.' He said, 'I call on Allah to be my witness, and you also bear witness, that I am free of all the gods you have apart from Him.",

    "11:58": "When Our command came, We rescued Hud and those who had iman along with him by a mercy from Us. We rescued them from a harsh punishment.",
    "11:59": "That was 'Ad. They denied the Signs of their Lord and disobeyed His Messengers and followed the command of every obdurate tyrant.",
    "11:60": "They were pursued by a curse in this world and on the Day of Rising. Yes indeed! 'Ad rejected their Lord, so away with 'Ad, the people of Hud!",
    "11:61": "To Thamud We sent their brother Salih. He said, 'My people, worship Allah! You have no god apart from Him. He brought you into being from the earth and made you its inhabitants. So ask His forgiveness and then",
    "11:62": "They said, 'Salih, we had great hopes in you before this happened. Do you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped? We have grave doubts about what you are calling us to.'",
    "11:63": "He said, 'My people! What do you think? If I were to possess a Clear Sign from my Lord and He had given me mercy from Him: who would help me against Allah if I disobeyed Him? You would not increase me in anything but loss.",
    "11:64": "My people! Here is the she-camel of Allah as a Sign for you. So leave her alone to eat on Allah's earth and do not inflict any harm on her or you will be overcome by an imminent punishment.'",
    "11:65": "But they hamstrung her, so he said, 'Enjoy yourselves in your land for three more days. That is a promise which will not be belied.'",
    "11:66": "Then when Our command came We rescued Salih and those who had iman along with him by a mercy from Us from the disgrace of that day. Your Lord is the All-Strong, the Almighty.",

    "11:78": "His people came running to him excitedly - they were long used to committing evil acts. He said, 'My people, here are my daughters. They are purer for you. So have taqwa of Allah and do not shame me with my guests. Is there not one rightly-guided man among you?'",
    "11:79": "They said, 'You know we have no claim on your daughters. You know very well what it is we want.'",

Set out with your family - except for your wife - in the middle of the night and none of you should look back . What strikes them will strike her as well. Their promised appointment is the morning. Is the morning not close at hand?'",

    "11:88": "He said, 'My people! What do you think? If I do possess a Clear Sign from my Lord and He has given me His good provision, I would clearly not want to go behind your backs and do something I have forbidden you to do. I only want to put things right as far as I can. My success is with Allah alone. I have put my trust in Him and I turn to Him.",
    "11:89": "My people! Do not let your breach with me provoke you into doing wrong so that the same thing happens to you as happened to the people of Nuh and the people of Hud and the people of Salih; and the people of Lut are not far distant from you.",

    "12:5": "He said, 'My son, don't tell your brothers your dream lest they devise some scheme to injure you, Shaytan is a clear-cut enemy to man.",
    "12:6": "Accordingly your Lord will pick you out and teach you the true meaning of events and perfectly fulfil His blessing on you as well as on the family of Ya'qub as He fulfilled it perfectly before upon your forebears, Ibrahim and Ishaq. Most certainly your Lord is Knowing, Wise.'",
    "12:7": "In Yusuf and his brothers there are Signs for every one of those who wants to ask.",
    "12:8": "When they declared, 'Why! Yusuf and his brother are dearer to our father than we are although we constitute a powerful group. Our father is clearly making a mistake.",
    "12:9": "Kill Yusuf or expel him to some land so that your father will look to you alone and then you can be people who do right.'",
    "12:10": "One of them said, 'Do not take Yusuf's life but throw him to the bottom of the well, so that some travellers",
    "12:11": "They said, 'Our father! What is wrong with you that you refuse to trust us with Yusuf when in truth we only wish him well?",
    "12:12": "Why don't you send him out with us tomorrow so he can enjoy himself and play about? All of us will make sure that he is safe.'",
    "12:13": "He said, 'It grieves me to let him go with you I fear a wolf might come and eat him up while you are heedless, not attending him.'",
    "12:14": "They said, 'If a wolf does come and eat him up when together we make up a powerful group in that case we would truly be in loss!'",
    "12:15": "But when, in fact, they did go out with him and gathered all together and agreed to put him at the bottom of the well, We then revealed to him that: 'You will inform them of this deed they perpetrate at a time when they are totally unaware.'",
    "12:16": "That night they came back to their father in tears,",
    "12:17": "saying, 'Father, we went out to run a race and left Yusuf together with our things and then a wolf appeared and ate him up but you are never going to believe us now, not even though we really tell the truth.'",
    "12:18": "They then produced his shirt with false blood on it. He said, 'It is merely that your lower selves have suggested something to you which you did; but beauty lies in showing steadfastness. It is Allah alone who is",
    "12:19": "Some travellers came that way and then dispatched their water-drawer who let his bucket down. He said, 'Good news for me, I've found a boy!' They then hid him away among their goods. Allah knew very well what they were doing.",
    "12:20": "They sold him for a pittance, a few small coins, considering him to be of little worth.",
    "12:21": "The Egyptian who had bought him told his wife, 'Look after him with honour and respect. It's possible he will be of use to us or perhaps we might adopt him as a son.' And thus We established Yusuf in the land to teach him the true meaning of events. Allah is in control of His affair. However, most of mankind do not know.",
    "12:22": "And then when he became a full-grown man. We gave him knowledge and right judgement too. That is how We reward all doers of good.",
    "12:23": "The woman whose house it was solicited him. She barred the doors and said, 'Come over here!' He said, 'Allah is my refuge! He is my lord and has been good to me with where I live. Those who do wrong will surely not succeed.'",
    "12:24": "She wanted him and he would have wanted her, had he not seen the Clear Proof of his Lord. That happened so We might avert from him all evil and lust. He was Our chosen slave.",
    "12:25": "They raced to the door. She tore his shirt at the back. They met her husband by the door. She said, 'How should a man whose intention was to harm your family be punished for what he did except with prison or painful punishment?'",
    "12:26": "He said, 'It was she who tried to seduce me.' A witness from her people then declared, 'If his shirt is torn in front, she speaks the truth and he has clearly told a shameless lie.",
    "12:27": "If his shirt is torn at the back, then she has lied and he has clearly told the simple truth.'",
    "12:28": "He saw the shirt torn at the back and said, 'The source of this is women's deviousness. Without a doubt your guile is very great.",
    "12:29": "Yusuf, ignore all this, and you, my wife, should ask forgiveness for your evil act. There is no doubt that you are in the wrong.'",
    "12:30": "Some city women said, 'The governor's wife solicited her slave. He's fired her heart with love. We see that she's the one to blame.'",
    "12:31": "But when she heard of their malicious talk, she sent for them and made a sumptuous meal and then she gave a knife to each of them. She said, 'Go out to them.' When they saw him, they were amazed by him and cut their hands. They said, 'Allah preserve us! This is no man. What can this be but a noble angel here!'",
    "12:32": "She said, 'You see! It's him you blamed me for. I tried seducing him but he refused. If he does not do what I order him, he will be put in prison and brought low.'",
    "12:33": "He said, 'My Lord, the prison is preferable to me than what they call on me to do. Unless You turn their guile away from me, it may well be that I will fall for them and so become a man of ignorance.'",
    "12:34": "His Lord replied to him and turned away from him their female guile and deviousness. He is the One Who Hears, the One Who Knows.",
    "12:35": "Then, after they had seen the Signs, they thought that they should still imprison him for a time.",
    "12:36": "Two servants entered prison along with him. One said, 'I dreamt that I was pressing grapes.' The other said, 'I dreamt I carried bread upon my head and birds were eating it. Tell us the true meaning of these dreams. We see that you're one of the righteous.'",
    "12:37": "He said, 'No meal to feed you will arrive before I have informed you what they mean. That is part of what about the world to come.",
    "12:38": "I hold fast to the creed of my forebears Ibrahim and Ishaq and Ya'qub. We don't associate anything with Allah. And that is how Allah has favoured us and all mankind, but most do not give thanks.",
    "12:39": "My fellow-prisoners, are many lords better, or Allah, the only One, the Conqueror?",
    "12:40": "What you serve apart from Him are only names which you and your forefathers have made up There is no mandate for them from Allah. Allah alone is qualified to judge. His order is to worship none but Him. That is in truth the straight and upright deen, but most of mankind simply do not know.",
    "12:41": "My fellow-captives, one of you will serve his lord with wine, the other of you will be crucified and birds will eat his head. The thing you asked about is foreordained.'",
    "12:42": "He said to the one of them he knew was saved, 'Please mention me when you are with your lord,' but Shaytan made him forget to remind his lord, and so he stayed in prison for several years.",
    "12:43": "The King declared, 'I dreamt of seven fat cows which seven thin ones ate and seven green ears of wheat and seven others which were dry. O counsellors! Explain my dream to me if you are those who can interpret visions!'",
    "12:44": "They said, 'A jumbled mass of mixed-up dreams! We do not know the meaning of such things.'",
    "12:45": "The one of them who had been saved then said, remembering after a period, 'I will tell you what it signifies, so send me out.'",
    "12:46": "'O truthful Yusuf, tell us of seven fat cows which seven thin ones ate and seven green ears of wheat and seven others which were dry so that I can return to them and let them know.'",
    "12:47": "He said, 'Sow for seven years in the normal way and leave that which you harvest in the ear except for a small amount from which you eat.",
    "12:48": "Then after that seven hard years will arrive in which you can eat from what you set aside for them, except for a little which you store.",
    "12:49": "Then after that another year will come in which the people will be helped by rain in plenty and when they once more will press.'",
    "12:50": "The King said, 'Bring him to me straight away!' but when the envoy came to him, he said, 'Go back to your master and enquire of him what happened about the women who cut their hands. My Lord has knowledge of their cunning guile.'",
    "12:51": "He said, 'What was this past affair of yours when you solicited Yusuf?' Then they said 'Allah forbid! We know no bad of him.' The governor's wife then said, 'The truth has now emerged. Indeed I tried to seduce him then and he has simply told the honest truth.",
    "12:52": "In this way he may know at last that I did not dishonour him behind his back and that Allah most surely does not guide the deviousness of the dishonourable.",
    "12:53": "I do not say my self was free from blame. The self indeed commands to evil acts - except for those my Lord has mercy on. My Lord, He is Forgiving, Merciful.'",
    "12:54": "The King said, 'Bring him to me straight away! so I may draw him very close to me.' When he had spoken with him, he declared, 'Today you are trusted, established in our sight.'",
    "12:55": "He said, 'Entrust the country's stores to me. In truth I am a knowing guardian.'",
    "12:56": "And thus We established Yusuf in the land so he could live in any olace he pleased. We grant Our grace to anyone We will and We do not allow to go to waste the wage of any people who do good.",
    "12:57": "But the wages of the akhira are the best for people who have iman and fear their Lord.",
    "12:58": "The brothers of Yusuf came into his presence and he knew them but they did not know him.",
    "12:59": "Then, having supplied their needs, he said to them, 'Bring me your brother, your father's youngest son. Do you not see that I dispense full measure and am the most hospitable of hosts?",
    "12:60": "But if you do not bring him here to me, your measure from me then will be denied and you will not come near to me at all.'",
    "12:61": "They said, 'We will request our father for him. That is something we will surely do.'",
    "12:62": "He told his serving men, 'Put back their goods into their saddlebags for them to find when they arrive back to their families so that perhaps they will return again.'",
    "12:63": "Then when they got back to their father's house, they said, 'Father! Our measure will be denied. Please send our brother with us so we may obtain our measure. We will take care of him.'",
    "12:64": "He said, 'How will my trusting him to your care be different from entrusting his brother before? The Best of Guardians, however, is Allah. He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.'",
    "12:65": "Then when they opened up their saddlebags and found their merchandise returned to them, they said, 'Our father! What more could we ask! Here is our merchandise returned to us. We can provide our families with food, and guard our brother and get an extra load. That is an easy measure to obtain.'",
    "12:66": "He said, 'I will not send him out with you until you make a covenant with Allah to bring him home unless you are overwhelmed.' When they had made their covenant, he said, 'Allah is Guardian over what we say.'",
    "12:67": "He said, 'My sons! You must not enter through a single gate. Go in through different gates. But I cannot save you from Allah at all, for judgement comes from no one but Allah. In Him I put my trust, and let all those who put their trust, put it in Him alone.'",
    "12:68": "But when they entered as their father said, it did not save them from Allah at all. yet a need in Ya'qub's soul was satisfied. He had knowledge which We had taught him, but most of mankind simply do not know.",
    "12:69": "Then when they entered into Yusuf's presence, he drew his brother close to him and said, 'I am your brother. Do not be distressed concerning all the things they used to do.'",
    "12:70": "Then when he had supplied them with their needs, he put the goblet in his brother's bag. A herald called out, 'Caravan! You are thieves!'",
    "12:71": "They turned to them and said, 'What are you missing?'",
    "12:72": "They said, 'We're missing the goblet of the king. The man who brings it will get a camel's load. Regarding that I stand as guarantor.'",
    "12:73": "They said, 'By Allah, you know we did not come to corrupt the land and that we are not thieves.'",
    "12:74": "They said, 'What is the reparation for it if it in fact transpires that you are liars?'",
    "12:75": "They said, 'Its reparation shall be him in the saddlebags of whom it is discovered. With us that is how wrongdoers are repaid.'",
    "12:76": "He started with their bags before his brother's, and then produced it from his brother's bag. In that way We devised a cunning scheme for Yusuf. He could not have held his brother according to the statutes of the King - only because Allah had willed it so. We raise the rank of anyone We will. Over everyone with knowledge is a Knower.",
    "12:77": "They said, 'If he steals now, his brother stole before.' But Yusuf kept it to himself and still did not disclose it to them, saying, 'The plight that you are in is worse than that. Allah knows best the matter you describe.'",
    "12:78": "They said, 'Your Eminence! He has an old and venerable father, so take one of us instead of him. We see without a doubt that you are of the people who do good.'",
    "12:79": "He said, 'Allah forbid that we should take anyone but him with whom our goods were found. In that case we would clearly be wrongdoers.'",
    "12:80": "When they despaired of him, they went apart to talk alone. The eldest of them said, 'You know full well vour father had vou make a covenant with Allah concernina this, and how before vou failed him with Yusuf. I will not leave this land until I have permission from my father, or Allah decides about the case on my behalf. Truly He is the justest Judge of all.",

    "12:89": "He said, 'Are you aware of what you did to Yusuf and his brother in ignorance?'",
    "12:90": "They said, 'Are you Yusuf?' He said, 'I am indeed Yusuf, and this here is my brother. Allah has acted graciously to us. As for those who fear Allah and are steadfast, Allah does not allow to go to waste the wage of any people who do good.'",
    "12:91": "They said, 'By Allah, Allah has favoured you above us. Clearly we were in the wrong.'",

    "12:95": "They said, 'By Allah! Your mind is still astray.'",
    "12:96": "But when the bringer of the good news came, he cast it on his face and sight returned. He said, 'Did I not say to you before, I know things from Allah you do not know?'",

    "12:109": "We sent none before you but men inspired with revelation from among the people of the cities. Have they not travelled in the land and seen the final fate of those before them? The abode of the Next World is better for those who have taqwa. So will you not use your intellect?",

He made the sun and moon subservient, each running for a specified term. He directs the whole affair. He makes the Signs clear so that hopefully you will be certain about the meeting with your Lord.",

And We make some things better to eat than others. There are Signs in that for people who use their intellect.",
    "13:5": "If you are surprised at their blindness, what could be more surprising than their words: 'What, when we are turned to dust, shall we then be created all anew?' These are the people who reject their Lord. Such people have iron collars round their necks. Such people are the Companions of the Fire, remaining in it timelessly, for ever.",
    "13:6": "They want you to hasten the bad rather than the good when examples of punishment are there before them in the past. Your Lord has forgiveness for people for their wrongdoing; but your Lord is also severe in retribution.",

    "13:13": "The thunder glorifies His praise, as do the angels, out of fear of Him. He discharges the thunderbolts, striking with them anyone He wills. Yet still they argue about Allah when He is inexorable in His power!",
    "13:14": "The call of truth is made to Him alone. Those they call upon apart from Him do not respond to them at all. It is like someone stretching out his cupped hands towards water to convey it to his mouth: it will never get there. The call of the kuffar only goes astray.",

Say: 'Allah is the Creator of everything. He is the One, the All- Conquering.'",

That is how Allah depicts the true and the false. As for the scum, it is quickly swept away. But as for that which is of use to people, it remains behind in the ground. That is a metaphor which Allah has made",

    "13:31": "Even if there was a Qur'an which moved mountains, or split the earth open or spoke to the dead . . .! On the contrary! The affair is Allah's altogether. Do those who have iman not know that if Allah had wanted to He could have guided all mankind? Those who are kafir will not cease to be struck by disaster for what they have done - or a disaster will happen close to their homes - until Allah's promise is fulfilled. Allah will not fail to keep His promise.",

Or would you inform Him of something in the earth He does not know, or are they words which are simply guesswork on your part?' However, the plotting of those who are kafir seems good to them and they bar the way. Anyone misguided by Allah has no guide.",

They will say, 'If Allah had guided us, we would have guided you. It makes no difference whether we cannot stand it or bear it patiently. We have no way of escape.'",

I had no authority over you, except that I called you and you responded to me. Do not, therefore, blame me but blame yourselves. I cannot come to your aid nor you to mine. I reject the way you associated me with Allah before.' The wrongdoers will have a painful punishment.",

    "15:57": "He added, 'What is your business, messengers?'",
    "15:58": "They said, 'We have been sent to a people who are evildoers -",
    "15:59": "with the exception of the family of Lut, all of whom We will save,",
    "15:60": "except for his wife. We have decreed her to be one of those who stay behind.'",
    "15:61": "When the Messengers came to the family of Lut,",
    "15:62": "he said, 'You are people we do not know.'",
    "15:63": "They said, 'We have come to you with what they had doubts about.",
    "15:64": "We have brought you the truth and we are certainly truthful men.",
    "15:65": "Travel with your family in the dead of night, following behind with them in front of you. None of you must look back. Go where you are ordered to.'",
    "15:66": "We revealed to him the command We had decreed: that on the following morning the last remnant of those people would be cut off.",
    "15:67": "The people of the city came, exulting at the news.",
    "15:68": "He said, These are my guests so do not put me to shame.",
    "15:69": "Have taqwa of Allah and do not dishonour me.'",
    "15:70": "They said, 'Did we not forbid you to play host to anyone at all?'",
    "15:71": "He said, 'Here are my daughters if you are determined to do something.'",
    "15:72": "By your life! They were wandering blindly in their drunkenness!",
    "15:73": "So the Great Blast seized hold of them at the break of day.",
    "15:74": "We turned the place completely upside down and rained down on them stones of hard-baked clay.",
    "15:75": "There are certainly Signs in that for the discerning.",
    "15:76": "They were beside a road which still exists.",
    "15:77": "There is certainly a Sign in that for the muminun.",
    "15:78": "The people of the Thicket* were also wrongdoers.",
    "15:79": "We took revenge on them as well. They are both beside a well-beaten track.",
    "15:80": "The people of al-Hijr denied the Messengers.",
    "15:81": "We brought them Our Signs but they turned away from them.",
    "15:82": "They carved out houses from the mountains, feeling safe,",
    "15:83": "but the Great Blast seized hold of them in the morning,",
    "15:84": "so all that they earned was of no use to them.",
    "15:85": "We did not create the heavens and earth and everything between them, except with truth. The Hour is certainly coming, so turn away graciously.",
    "15:86": "Your Lord, He is the Creator, the All-Knowing.",
    "15:87": "We have given you the Seven Oft-repeated* and the Magnificent Qur'an.",
    "15:88": "Do not direct your eyes longingly to what We have given certain of them to enjoy. Do not feel sad concerning them. And take the muminun under your wing.",
    "15:89": "Say: 'I am indeed a clear warner.'",
    "15:90": "Just as We sent down punishment on the dissectors,",
    "15:91": "those who divide the Qur'an into little pieces.",
    "15:92": "By your Lord, We will question them all, every one of them,",
    "15:93": "about what they did!",
    "15:94": "Proclaim what you have been ordered to and turn away from the idolaters.",

    "15:96": "those who set up another god beside Allah. They will soon know!",
    "15:97": "We know that your breast is constricted by what they say.",
    "15:98": "So glorify your Lord with praise and be one of the prostrators.",
    "15:99": "And worship your Lord until what is Certain comes to you.",
    "16:1": "Allah's command is coming, so do not try to hasten it. Glory be to Him! He is exalted above anything they associate with Him.",
    "16:2": "He sends down angels with the Ruh of His command to any of His slaves He wills: 'Give warning that there is no god but Me, so have taqwa of Me!'",
    "16:3": "He created the heavens and the earth with truth. He is exalted above anything they associate with Him.",
    "16:4": "He created man from a drop of sperm and yet he is an open challenger!",
    "16:5": "And He created livestock. There is warmth for you in them, and various uses and some you eat.",
    "16:6": "And there is beauty in them for you in the evening when you bring them home and in the morning when you drive them out to graze.",
    "16:7": "They carry your loads to lands you would never reach except with great difficulty. Your Lord is All-Gentle,",
    "16:8": "And horses, mules and donkeys both to ride and for adornment. And He creates other things you do not know.",
    "16:9": "The Way should lead to Allah, but there are those who deviate from it. If He had wished He could have guided every one of you.",
    "16:10": "It is He who sends down water from the sky. From it you drink and from it come the shrubs among which you graze your herds.",
    "16:11": "And by it He makes crops grow for you and olives and dates and grapes and fruit of every kind. There is certainly a Sign in that for people who reflect.",
    "16:12": "He has made night and day subservient to you, and the sun and moon and stars, all subject to His command. There are certainly Signs in that for people who use their intellect.",
    "16:13": "And also the things of varying colours He has created for you in the earth. There is certainly a Sign in that for people who pay heed.",
    "16:14": "It is He who made the sea subservient to you so that you can eat fresh flesh from it and bring out from it ornaments to wear. And you see the ships cleaving through it so that you can seek His bounty, and so that hopefully you will show thanks.",
    "16:15": "He cast firmly embedded mountains on the earth so it would not move under you, and rivers and pathways so that hopefully you would be guided, and landmarks.",
    "16:16": "And they are guided by the stars.",
    "16:17": "Is He who creates like him who does not create? So will you not pay heed?",
    "16:18": "If you tried to number Allah's blessings, you could never count them. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most",
    "16:19": "Allah knows what you keep secret and what you make public.",
    "16:20": "Those you call on besides Allah do not create anything. They are themselves created.",
    "16:21": "They are dead, not alive, and they are not aware of when they will be raised.",
    "16:22": "Your God is One God. As for those who do not have iman in the Next World, their hearts are in denial and they are puffed up with pride.",
    "16:23": "There is no doubt that Allah knows what they keep secret and what they make public. He does not love people puffed up with pride.",
    "16:24": "When they are asked, 'What has your Lord sent down?' they say, 'Myths and legends of previous peoples.'",
    "16:25": "So on the Day of Rising they will carry the full weight of their own burdens and some of the burdens of those they misguided without knowledge. What an evil load they bear!",
    "16:26": "Those before them also plotted, and Allah came at their building from the foundations and the roof caved in on top of them. The punishment came at them from where they did not expect.",
    "16:27": "Then on the Day of Rising He will disgrace them, and say, 'Where are My partner gods for whose sake you became so hostile?' Those given knowledge will say, Today there is disgrace and evil for the kafirun.'",
    "16:28": "As for those the angels take in death while they are wronging themselves, they will offer their submission: 'We did not do any evil.' Oh yes you did! Allah knows what you were doing.",
    "16:29": "'Enter the gates of Hell, remaining in it timelessly, for ever. How evil is the abode of the arrogant!'",
    "16:30": "When those who have taqwa of Allah are asked, 'What has your Lord sent down?' their reply is, 'Good!' There is good in this world for those who do good, and the abode of the Next World is even better. How wonderful is the abode of those who have taqwa:",
    "16:31": "Gardens of Eden which they enter, with rivers flowing under them, where they have whatever they desire. That is how Allah repays those who have taqwa:",
    "16:32": "those the angels take in a virtuous state. They say, 'Peace be upon you! Enter the Garden for what you did.'",
    "16:33": "What are they waiting for but the angels to come to them or your Lord's command to come? That is like what those before them did. Allah did not wrong them; rather they wronged themselves.",
    "16:34": "The evil actions they did assailed them. They were engulfed by what they mocked.",
    "16:35": "The idolaters say, 'If Allah had willed we would not have worshipped anything apart from Him, neither we nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything without His say.' Those before them said the same. Are the Messengers responsible for anything but clear transmission?",
    "16:36": "We sent a Messenger among every people saying: 'Worship Allah and keep clear of all false gods.' Among them were some whom Allah guided but others received the misguidance they deserved. Travel about the earth and see the final fate of the deniers.",
    "16:37": "However eager you are for them to be guided, Allah will not guide those whom He misguides. They will have no helpers.",
    "16:38": "They swear by Allah with their most earnest oaths that Allah will not raise up those who die, when, on the contrary, it is a binding promise on Him; but most people do not know it.",
    "16:39": "It is so that He can make clear to them the things they differed about and so that those who were kafir will know that they were liars.",
    "16:40": "Our Word to a thing when We desire it is just to say to it 'Be!' and it is.",
    "16:41": "As for those who make hijra for Allah's sake after being wronged, We shall give them good lodging in this world, and the reward of the Next World is greater still if they only knew",
    "16:42": "- those who are steadfast and put their trust in their Lord.",
    "16:43": "We have only ever sent before you men who were given Revelation - ask the People of the Reminder if you do not know - who brought Clear Signs and Revealed Books.",
    "16:44": "And We have sent down the Reminder to you so that you can make clear to mankind what has been sent down to them so that hopefully they will reflect.",
    "16:45": "Do those who plot evil actions feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them up or that a punishment will not come upon them from where they least expect?",
    "16:46": "Or that He will not seize them on their travels, something they are powerless to prevent?",
    "16:47": "Or that He will not seize them little by little? For your Lord is All-Compassionate, Most Merciful.",
    "16:48": "Do they not see the things Allah has created, casting their shadows to the right and to the left, prostrating themselves before Allah in complete humility?",
    "16:49": "Everything in the heavens and every creature on the earth prostrates to Allah, as do the angels. They are not puffed up with pride.",
    "16:50": "They fear their Lord above them and do everything they are ordered to do.",
    "16:51": "Allah says, 'Do not take two gods. He is only One God. So dread Me alone.'",
    "16:52": "Everything in the heavens and earth belongs to Him, and the deen belongs to Him, firmly and for ever. So why do you fear anyone other than Allah?",
    "16:53": "Any blessing you have is from Allah. Then when harm touches you, it is to Him you cry for help.",
    "16:54": "But when He removes the harm from you, a group of you associate others with their Lord,",
    "16:55": "ungrateful for what We have given them. Enjoy yourselves. You will soon know!",
    "16:56": "They allot a portion of the provision We have given them to things they have no knowledge of at all. By Allah, you will be asked about what you invented!",
    "16:57": "They allot daughters to Allah - glory be to Him! - while they have what they want!",
    "16:58": "When one of them is given the good news of a baby girl, his face darkens and he is furious.",
    "16:59": "He hides away from people because of the evil of the good news he has been given. Should he keep her ignominiously or bury her in the earth? What an evil judgement they make!",
    "16:60": "Those who do not have iman in the Next World have an evil likeness. Allah's is the Highest Likeness. He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.",
    "16:61": "If Allah were to punish people for their wrong actions, not a single creature would be left upon the earth, but He defers them till a predetermined time. When their specified time arrives, they cannot delay it for a single hour nor can they bring it forward.",
    "16:62": "They allot to Allah what they themselves dislike and their tongues frame the lie that they will receive the Best. There is no doubt at all that they will receive the Fire and that they are people who go to excess.",
    "16:63": "By Allah, We sent Messengers to communities before your time, but Shaytan made their actions seem good to them. Therefore today he is their protector. They will have a painful punishment.",
    "16:64": "We have only sent down the Book to you so that you can make clear to them the things about which they differ, and as a guidance and a mercy to people who have iman.",
    "16:65": "Allah sends down water from the sky and by it brings the dead earth back to life. There is certainly a Sign in that for people who hear.",
    "16:66": "There is instruction for you in cattle. From the contents of their bellies, from between the dung and blood, We give you pure milk to drink, easy for drinkers to swallow.",
    "16:67": "And from the fruit of the date-palm and the grape-vine you derive both intoxicants and wholesome provision. There is certainly a Sign in that for people who use their intellect.",
    "16:68": "Your Lord revealed to the bees: 'Build dwellings in the mountains and the trees, and also in the structures which men erect.",
    "16:69": "Then eat from every kind of fruit and travel the paths of your Lord, which have been made easy for you to follow.' From inside them comes a drink of varying colours, containing healing for mankind. There is certainly a Sign in that for people who reflect.",
    "16:70": "Allah created you and then will take you back again. And some of you revert to the lowest form of life so that after having knowledge, you know nothing at all. Allah is All-Knowing, Ail-Powerful.",
    "16:71": "Allah has favoured some of you over others in provision, but those who have been favoured do not give their provision to their slaves so they become the same in respect of it. So why do they renounce the blessings of Allah?",
    "16:72": "Allah has given you wives from among yourselves, and given you children and grandchildren from your wives, and provided good things for you. So why do they have iman in falsehood and reject the blessings of Allah,",
    "16:73": "And worship, instead of Allah, things that have no control over their provision from the heavens or earth in any way, and are themselves completely impotent?",
    "16:74": "Do not try to make metaphors for Allah. Allah knows and you do not know.",
    "16:75": "Allah does make a metaphor: an owned slave possessing no power over anything, and someone We have given plentiful provision who gives out from it secretly and openly. Are they the same? Praise be to Allah! They are not! But most people do not know it.",
    "16:76": "Allah makes another metaphor: two men, one of them deaf and dumb, unable to do anything, a burden on his master, no matter where he directs him he brings no good, is he the same as someone who commands justice and is on a straight path?",
    "16:77": "The Unseen of the heavens and earth belongs to Allah. The matter of the Hour is only the blink of an eye away, or even nearer. Allah has power over all things.",
    "16:78": "Allah brought you out of your mothers' wombs knowing nothing at all, and gave you hearing, sight and hearts so that perhaps you would show thanks.",
    "16:79": "Do they not see the birds suspended in mid-air up in the sky? Nothing holds them there except Allah. There are certainly Signs in that for people who have iman.",
    "16:80": "Allah has made your houses places of rest for you and made houses for you out of cattle hides which are light for you to carry both when you are travelling and when you are staying in one place. And from their wool and fur and hair you obtain clothing and carpets and household utensils for a time.",
    "16:81": "Allah has made shaded places for you in what He has created and He has made shelters for you in the other's violence. In that way He perfects His blessing on you so that hopefully you will become Muslims.",
    "16:82": "But if they turn their backs, you are only responsible for clear transmission.",
    "16:83": "They acknowledge Allah's blessing and then deny it. Most of them are kuffar.",
    "16:84": "On the Day We raise up a witness from every nation, those who were kafir will not be excused nor will they be able to appease Allah.",
    "16:85": "When those who did wrong see the punishment, it will not be lightened for them. They will be granted no reprieve.",
    "16:86": "When those who associated others with Allah see those they associated, they will say, 'Our Lord, these are our partner gods, the ones we called upon apart from You.' But they will fling their words back in their faces: 'You are truly liars!'",
    "16:87": "On that Day they will offer their submission to Allah and the things they invented will abandon them.",
    "16:88": "As for those who were kafir and barred access to the way of Allah. We will heap punishment on top of their punishment because of the corruption they brought about.",
    "16:89": "On that Day We will raise up among every community a witness against them from amongst themselves, and bring you as a witness against them. We have sent down the Book to you making all things clear and as guidance and mercy and good news for the Muslims.",
    "16:90": "Allah commands justice and doing good and giving to relatives. And He forbids indecency and doing wrong and tyranny. He warns you so that hopefully you will pay heed.",
    "16:91": "Be true to Allah's contract when you have agreed to it, and do not break your oaths once they are confirmed and you have made Allah your guarantee. Allah knows what you do.",
    "16:92": "Do not be like a woman who spoils the thread she has spun by unravelling it after it is strong, by making your oaths a means of deceiving one another, merely because one community is bigger than another. Allah is only testing you by this. He will make clear to you on the Day of Rising the things about which you differed.",
    "16:93": "If Allah had willed He would have made you one community. However, He misguides anyone He wills and guides anyone He wills. You will be questioned about what you did.",
    "16:94": "Do not make your oaths a means of deceiving one another or your foot will slip after it was firmly placed and you will taste evil for barring access to the Way of Allah and you will have a terrible punishment.",
    "16:95": "Do not sell Allah's contract for a paltry price. What is with Allah is better for you if you only knew.",
    "16:96": "What is with you runs out but what is with Allah goes on for ever. Those who were steadfast will be recompensed according to the best of what they did.",
    "16:97": "Anyone who acts rightly, male or female, being a mumin, We will give them a good life and We will recompense them according to the best of what they did.",
    "16:98": "Whenever you recite the Qur'an, seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan.",
    "16:99": "He has no authority over those who have iman and put their trust in their Lord.",
    "16:100": "He only has authority over those who take him as a friend and associate others with Allah.",
    "16:101": "If we replace one ayat with another one - and Allah knows best what He is sending down - they say, 'You are just inventing this!' No indeed! Most of them have no knowledge.",
    "16:102": "Say: The Purest Ruh has brought it down from your Lord with truth, to make those who have iman firm, and as guidance and good news for the Muslims.'",
    "16:103": "We know that they say, 'It is only a human being who is teaching him.' The language of him they allude to is a foreign one whereas this is in clear and lucid Arabic.",
    "16:104": "As for those who do not have iman in Allah's Signs, Allah will not guide them and they will have a painful punishment.",
    "16:105": "Those who do not have iman in Allah's Signs are merely inventing lies. It is they who are the liars.",
    "16:106": "Those who reject Allah after having had iman - except for someone forced to do it whose heart remains at rest in its iman - but as for those whose breasts become dilated with kufr, anger from Allah will come down on them. They will have a terrible punishment.",
    "16:107": "That is because they prefer the life of this world to the Next World and because Allah does not guide kafir people.",
    "16:108": "Those are the people whose hearts, hearing and sight Allah has sealed up. They are the unaware.",
    "16:109": "There is no doubt that in the akhira they will be the losers.",
    "16:110": "But to those who made hijra after they were persecuted and then did jihad and remained steadfast, to them your Lord is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "16:111": "On that Day every self will come to argue for itself and every self will be paid in full for what it did. They will not be wronged.",
    "16:112": "Allah makes an example of a city which was safe and at peace, its provision coming to it plentifully from every side. Then it showed ingratitude for Allah's blessings so Allah made it wear the robes of hunger and fear for what it did.",
    "16:113": "A Messenger from among them came to them but they denied him. So the punishment seized them and they were wrongdoers.",
    "16:114": "So eat from what Allah has provided for you, halal and good, and be thankful for the blessing of Allah if it is Him you worship.",
    "16:115": "He has forbidden you carrion, blood and pork and anything consecrated to other than Allah. But if someone is forced to eat it, without desiring to or going to excess in it, your Lord is Ever-Forgiving, Most",
    "16:116": "Do not say about what your lying tongues describe: 'This is halal and this is haram,' inventing lies against Allah.",
    "16:117": "Those who invent lies against Allah are not successful - a brief enjoyment, then they will have a painful punishment.",
    "16:118": "We forbade the Jews those things We told you about before. We did not wrong them; rather they wronged themselves.",
    "16:119": "But to those who do evil in ignorance and then after that make tawba and put things right, to them your Lord is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "16:120": "Ibrahim was a community in himself, exemplary, obedient to Allah, a man of pure natural belief. He was not one of the idolaters.",
    "16:121": "He was thankful for His blessings. Allah chose him and guided him to a straight path.",
    "16:122": "We gave him good in this world and in the Next World he will be one of the righteous.",
    "16:123": "Then We revealed to you: 'Follow the religion of Ibrahim, a man of pure natural belief. He was not one of the idolaters.'",
    "16:124": "The Sabbath was only enjoined on those who differed about it. Your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Rising regarding the things about which they differed.",
    "16:125": "Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and fair admonition, and argue with them in the kindest way. Your Lord knows best who is misguided from His way. And He knows best who are guided.",
    "16:126": "If you want to retaliate, retaliate to the same degree as the injury done to you. But if you are patient, it is better to be patient.",
    "16:127": "Be patient. But your patience is only by Allah. Do not be grieved by them and do not be constricted by the plots they hatch.",
    "16:128": "Allah is with those who have taqwa of Him and with those who are good-doers.",
    "17:1": "Glory be to Him who took His slave on a journey by night from the Masjid al-Haram to the Masjid al-Aqsa, whose surroundings We have blessed, in order to show him some of Our Signs. He is the All-Hearing, the All- Seeing.",
    "17:2": "We gave Musa the Book and made it guidance for the tribe of Israel: 'Do not take anyone besides Me as a guardian.'",
    "17:3": "Descendants of those We carried with Nuh. He was a grateful slave.",

    "17:5": "When the promised first time came, We sent against you slaves of Ours possessing great force, and they ransacked your houses, rampaging right through them. It was a promise which was fulfilled.",
    "17:6": "Then once again We gave you the upper hand over them and supplied you with more wealth and children and made you the most numerous group.",
    "17:7": "If you do good, you do it to yourselves. If you do evil, you do it to your detriment. When the next promised time arrived, it was so that they could injure you and enter the Temple as they had entered it the first time, and in order to completely destroy what they had conquered.",
    "17:8": "It may well be that your Lord will have mercy on you. But if you revert to what you did, We also will revert. We have made Hell a prison for the kafirun.'",
    "17:9": "This Qur'an guides to the most upright Way and gives good news to the muminun who do right actions that they will have a large reward.",
    "17:10": "But as for those who do not have iman in the Next World, We have prepared for them a painful punishment.",
    "17:11": "Man prays for evil just as he prays for good. Man is prone to be impetuous.",
    "17:12": "We made the night and day two Signs. We blotted out the Sign of the night and made the Sign of the day a time for seeing so that you can seek favour from your Lord and will know the number of years and the reckoning of time. We have made all things very clear.",
    "17:13": "We have fastened the destiny of every man about his neck and on the Day of Rising We will bring out a Book for him which he will find spread open in front of him.",
    "17:14": "'Read your Book! Today your own self is reckoner enough against you!'",
    "17:15": "Whoever is guided is only guided to his own good. Whoever is misguided is only misguided to his detriment. No burden-bearer can bear another's burden. We never punish until We have sent a Messenger.",
    "17:16": "When We desire to destroy a city, We send a command to the affluent in it and they become deviant in it and the Word is justly carried out against it and We annihilate it completely.",
    "17:17": "How many generations We destroyed after Nuh! Your Lord is well able to be aware of and see the wrong actions of His slaves!",
    "17:18": "As for anyone who desires this fleeting existence, We hasten in it whatever We will to whoever We want. Then We will consign him to Hell where he will roast, reviled and driven out.",
    "17:19": "But as for anyone who desires the Next World, and strives for it with the striving it deserves, being a",

    "17:27": "Squanderers are brothers to the shaytans, and Shaytan was ungrateful to his Lord.",

    "17:31": "Do not kill your children out of fear of being poor. We will provide for them and you. Killing them is a terrible mistake.",
    "17:32": "And do not go near to fornication. It is an indecent act, an evil way.",
    "17:33": "Do not kill any person Allah has made inviolate, except with the right to do so. If someone is wrongly killed We have given authority to his next of kin. But he should not be excessive in taking life. He will be helped.",

    "17:35": "Give full measure when you measure and weigh with a level balance. That is better and gives the best result.",
    "17:36": "Do not pursue what you have no knowledge of. Hearing, sight and hearts will all be questioned.",
    "17:37": "Do not strut arrogantly about the earth. You will certainly never split the earth apart nor will you ever rival the mountains in height.",
    "17:38": "All of that is evil action and hateful in the sight of your Lord.",
    "17:39": "That is part of the wisdom your Lord has revealed to you. Do not set up another god together with Allah and so be thrown into Hell, blamed and driven out.",
    "17:40": "Has your Lord honoured you with sons and Himself taken the angels as daughters? It is truly something terrible that you say!",
    "17:41": "We have made things clear in this Qur'an so that they might pay heed, but it only makes them run away the more!",

    "17:44": "The seven heavens and the earth and everyone in them glorify Him. There is nothing which does not glorify Him with praise but you do not understand their glorification. He is All-Forbearing, Ever-Forgiving.",
    "17:45": "When you recite the Qur'an, We place an obscuring veil between you and those who do not believe in the akhira.",
    "17:46": "We have placed covers on their hearts, preventing them from understanding it, and heaviness in their ears. When you mention your Lord alone in the Qur'an, they turn their backs and run away.",
    "17:47": "We know how they listen when they listen to you, and when they confer together secretly, and when the wrongdoers say, 'You are only following a man who is bewitched!'",
    "17:48": "Look how they make likenesses of you and go astray. They are unable to find their way.",
    "17:49": "They say, 'What! When we are bones and crumbled dust, will we then be raised up as a new creation!'",
    "17:50": "Say: 'It would not matter if you were rock or iron,",
    "17:51": "Or indeed any created thing that you think is harder still!' They will say, 'Who will bring us back again?' Say: 'He who brought you into being in the first place.' They will shake their heads at you and ask, 'When will it happen?' Say: 'It may well be that it is very near.'",
    "17:52": "On the Day He calls you, you will respond by praising Him and think that you have only tarried a very short time.",
    "17:53": "Say to My slaves that they should only say the best. Shaytan wants to stir up trouble between them. Shaytan is an outright enemy to man.",
    "17:54": "Your Lord knows you best. If He wills, He will have mercy on you, and, if He wills, He will punish you. We did not send you to be their guardian.",
    "17:55": "My Lord knows best everyone in the heavens and earth. We favoured some of the Prophets over others. And We gave Dawud the Zabur.",
    "17:56": "Say: 'Call on those you make claims for apart from Him. They possess no power to remove any harm from you or to change anything.'",
    "17:57": "Those they call on are themselves seeking the means by which they might approach their Lord - even those who are the closest to Him - and are hoping for His mercy and fearing his punishment. The punishment of your Lord is truly something to be feared.",

    "17:59": "Nothing has prevented Us sending you Signs except the fact that the previous peoples denied them. We gave Thamud the she-camel as a visible Sign, and then they mistreated her. We do not send Signs except to frighten people.",
    "17:60": "When We said to you, 'Surely your Lord encompasses the people with His knowledge.' We only appointed the vision We showed you and the Accursed Tree in the Qur'an as a trial and temptation for the people. We frighten them, but it only increases them in their excessive insolence.",
    "17:61": "When We said to the angels, 'Prostrate yourselves to Adam!' they prostrated, except for Iblis. He said 'What! Am I to prostrate to one You have created out of clay?'",

    "17:64": "Stir up any of them you can with your voice and rally against them your cavalry and your infantry and share with them in their children and their wealth and make them promises! The promise of Shaytan is nothing but delusion.",
    "17:65": "But as for My slaves, you will not have any authority over them.' Your Lord suffices as a guardian.",
    "17:66": "Your Lord is He who propels the ships on the sea for you so that you may seek His bounty. He is indeed",
    "17:67": "When harm occurs to you at sea, those you call on vanish - except for Him alone! But when He delivers you to dry land, you turn away. Man truly is ungrateful.",
    "17:68": "Do you feel secure against Him causing the shore to swallow you up or sending against you a sudden squall of stones? Then you will find no one to be your guardian.",
    "17:69": "Or do you feel secure against Him taking you back into it another time and sending a violent storm against you and drowning you for your ingratitude? Then you will find no one to defend you against Us.",
    "17:70": "We have honoured the sons of Adam and conveyed them on land and sea and provided them with good things and favoured them greatly over many We have created.",
    "17:71": "On the Day We summon every people with their records, those who are given their Book in their right hand will read their Book and they will not be wronged by even the smallest speck.",
    "17:72": "Those who are blind in this world will be blind in the Next World and even further off the Path.",
    "17:73": "They were very near to enticing you away from some of what We have revealed to you, hoping that you would invent something against Us. Then they would have taken you as their intimate.",
    "17:74": "If We had not made you firm, you would have leaned towards them a little.",
    "17:75": "Then We would have let you taste a double punishment in life and a double punishment in death. You would not have found any helper against Us.",
    "17:76": "They were very near to scaring you from the land with the object of expelling you from it. But had they done so they would only have remained there a short time after you.",
    "17:77": "That was the pattern with those We sent before you as Our Messengers. You will not find any changing of Our pattern.",
    "17:78": "Establish salat from the time the sun declines until the darkening of the night, and also the recitation at dawn. The dawn recitation is certainly witnessed.",
    "17:79": "And stay awake for prayer during part of the night as a supererogatory action for yourself. It may well be that your Lord will raise you to a Praiseworthy Station.",
    "17:80": "Say: 'My Lord, make my entry sincere and make my leaving sincere and grant me supporting authority direct from Your Presence.'",
    "17:81": "Say: 'Truth has come and falsehood has vanished. Falsehood is always bound to vanish.'",
    "17:82": "We send down in the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to the muminun, but it only increases the wrongdoers in loss.",

    "17:89": "We have variegated throughout this Qur'an all kinds of examples for people, but most people spurn anything but kufr.",
    "17:90": "They say, 'We will not believe you until you make a spring gush out from the earth for us;",
    "17:91": "or have a garden of dates and grapes which you make rivers come pouring through;",
    "17:92": "or make the sky, as you claim, fall down on us in lumps; or bring Allah and the angels here as a guarantee;",

We will gather them on the Day of Rising, flat on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf. Their shelter will be Hell. Whenever the Blaze dies down, We will increase it for them.",
    "17:98": "That is their repayment for rejecting Our Signs and saying, 'What, when we are bones and crumbled dust, will we then be raised up as a new creation?'",
    "17:99": "Do they not see that Allah, Who created the heavens and earth, has the power to create the like of them, and has appointed fixed terms for them of which there is no doubt? But the wrongdoers still spurn anything but kufr.",

    "17:101": "We gave Musa nine Clear Signs. Ask the tribe of Israel about when he came to them and Pharaoh said to him, 'Musa, I think you are bewitched.'",
    "17:102": "He said, 'You know that no one sent these down but the Lord of the heavens and earth to be clear proofs. Pharaoh, I think you are destroyed.'",

    "17:109": "they fall to the ground in prostration, and it increases them in humility.",

    "18:1": "Praise belongs to Allah Who has sent down the Book to His slave and has put no crookedness in it.",

    "18:4": "and to warn those who say 'Allah has a son.'",
    "18:5": "They have no knowledge of this, neither they nor their fathers. It is a monstrous utterance which has issued from their mouths. What they say is nothing but a lie.",

    "18:7": "We made everything on the earth adornment for it so that We could test them to see whose actions are the best.",
    "18:8": "We will certainly make everything on it a barren wasteland.",
    "18:9": "Do you consider that the Companions of the Cave and Ar-Raqim were one of the most remarkable of Our Signs?",
    "18:10": "When the young men took refuge in the cave and said, 'Our Lord, give us mercy directly from You and open the way for us to right guidance in our situation.'",
    "18:11": "So We sealed their ears with sleep in the cave for a number of years.",
    "18:12": "Then We woke them up again so that We might see which of the two groups would better calculate the time they had stayed there.",
    "18:13": "We will relate their story to you with truth. They were young men who had iman in their Lord and We increased them in guidance.",
    "18:14": "We fortified their hearts when they stood up and said, 'Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and We will not call on any god apart from Him. We would in that case have uttered an abomination.",
    "18:15": "These people of ours have taken gods apart from Him. Why do they not produce a clear authority concerning them? Who could do greater wrong than someone who invents a lie against Allah?",
    "18:16": "When you have separated yourselves from them and everything they worship except Allah, take refuge in the cave and your Lord will unfold His mercy to you and open the way to the best for you in your situation.'",
    "18:17": "You would have seen the sun, when it rose, inclining away from their cave towards the right, and, when it set, leaving them behind on the left, while they were lying in an open part of it. That was one of Allah's Signs. Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. But if He misguides someone, you will find no protector for them to guide them rightly.",
    "18:18": "You would have supposed them to be awake whereas in fact they were asleep. We turned them to the right and to the left, and, at the entrance, their dog stretched out its paws. If you had looked down and seen them, you would have turned from them and run and have been filled with terror at the sight of them.",
    "18:19": "That was the situation when we woke them up so they could question one another. One of them asked, 'How long have you been here?' They replied, 'We have been here for a day or part of a day.' They said, 'Your Lord knows best how long you have been here. Send one of your number into the city with this silver you have, so he can see which food is purest and bring you some of it to eat. But he should go about with caution so that no one is aware of you,",
    "18:20": "for if they find out about you they will stone you or make you revert to their religion and then you will never have success.'",
    "18:21": "Accordingly We made them chance upon them unexpectedly so they might know that Allah's promise is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour. When they were arguing among themselves about the matter, they said, 'Wall up their cave, their Lord knows best about them.' But those who got the better of the argument concerning them said, 'We will build a place of worship over them.'",
    "18:22": "They will say, 'There were three of them, their dog being the fourth.' They will say, 'There were five of them, their dog being the sixth,' guessing at the Unseen. And they will say, 'There were seven of them, their dog being the eighth.' Say: 'My Lord knows best their number. Those who know about them are very few.' So do not enter into any argument concerning them, except in relation to what is clearly known. And do not seek the opinion of any of them regarding them.",

    "18:24": "Without adding 'If Allah wills.' Remember your Lord when you forget, and say, 'Hopefully my Lord will guide me to something closer to right guidance than this.'",
    "18:25": "They stayed in their Cave for three hundred years and added nine.",
    "18:26": "Say: 'Allah knows best how long they stayed. The Unseen of the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. How perfectly He sees, how well He hears! They have no protector apart from Him. Nor does He share His rule with anyone.'",
    "18:27": "Recite what has been revealed to you of your Lord's Book. No one can change His Words. You will never find any safe haven apart from Him.",
    "18:28": "Restrain yourself patiently with those who call on their Lord morning and evening, desiring His face. Do not turn your eyes from them, desiring the attractions of this world. And do not obey someone whose heart We have made neglectful of Our remembrance and who follows his own whims and desires and whose life has transgressed all bounds.",
    "18:29": "Say: 'It is the truth from your Lord; so let whoever wishes have iman and whoever wishes be kafir.' We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire whose billowing walls of smoke will hem them in. If they call for help, they will be helped with water like seething molten brass, frying their faces. What a noxious drink! What an evil repose!",

    "18:31": "They will have Gardens of Eden with rivers flowing under them. They will be adorned in them with bracelets made of gold and wear green garments made of the finest silk and rich brocade, reclining there on couches under canopies. What an excellent reward! What a wonderful repose!",
    "18:32": "Make an example for them of two men. To one of them We gave two gardens of grape-vines and surrounded them with date-palms, putting between them some cultivated land.",
    "18:33": "Both gardens yielded their crops and did not suffer any loss, and We made a river flow right through the",

    "18:35": "He entered his garden and wronged himself by saying, 'I do not think that this will ever end.",
    "18:36": "I do not think the Hour will ever come. But if I should be sent back to my Lord, I will definitely get something better in return.'",
    "18:37": "His companion, with whom he was debating, said to him, 'Do you then disbelieve in Him who created you from dust, then from a drop of sperm, and then formed you as a man?",
    "18:38": "He is, however, Allah, my Lord, and I will not associate anyone with my Lord.",
    "18:39": "Why, when you entered your garden, did you not say, \"It is as Allah wills, there is no strength but in Allah\"? Though you see me with less wealth and children than you possess,",
    "18:40": "it may well be that my Lord will give me something better than your garden and send down on it a fireball from the sky so that morning finds it a shifting heap of dust,",
    "18:41": "or morning finds its water drained into the earth so that you cannot get at it.'",
    "18:42": "The fruits of his labour were completely destroyed and he woke up wringing his hands in grief, rueing everything that he had spent on it. It was a ruin with all its trellises fallen in. He said, 'Oh, if only I had not associated anyone with my Lord!'",
    "18:43": "There was no group to come to his aid, besides Allah, and he was not given any help.",
    "18:44": "In that situation the only protection is from Allah, the Real. He gives the best reward and the best outcome.",
    "18:45": "Make a metaphor for them of the life of this world. It is like water which We send down from the sky and the plants of the earth combine with it but then become dry chaff scattered by the winds. Allah has absolute power over everything.",
    "18:46": "Wealth and sons are the embellishment of the life of this world. But, in your Lord's sight, right actions which are lasting bring a better reward and are a better basis for hope.",
    "18:47": "On the Day We make the mountains move and you see the earth laid bare and We gather them together, not leaving out a single one of them,",
    "18:48": "they will be paraded before your Lord in ranks: 'You have come to Us just as We created you at first. Yes indeed! Even though you claimed that We would not fix a time with you.'",
    "18:49": "The Book will be set in place and you will see the evildoers fearful of what is in it. They will say, 'Alas for us! What is this Book which does not pass over any action, small or great, without recording it?' They will find there everything they did and your Lord will not wrong anyone at all.",
    "18:50": "When We said to the angels, 'Prostrate yourselves to Adam,' they prostrated with the exception of Iblis. He was one of the jinn and wantonly deviated from his Lord's command. Do you take him and his offspring as protectors apart from Me when they are your enemy? How evil is the exchange the wrongdoers make!",

    "18:52": "On the Day He says, 'Call My partner-gods, those for whom you made such claims,' they will call on them but they will not respond to them. We will place between them an unbridgeable gulf.",
    "18:53": "The evildoers will see the Fire and realise they are going to fall into it and find no way of escaping from it.",
    "18:54": "We have variegated throughout this Qur'an all kinds of examples for people, but, more than anything else, man is argumentative!",
    "18:55": "When guidance came to the people nothing prevented them from having iman and asking for forgiveness from their Lord but the fact that the pattern of previous peoples did not happen to them or that the punishment did not appear before their eyes.",
    "18:56": "We only send the Messengers to bring good news and to give warning. Those who are kafir use fallacious arguments to deny the truth. They make a mockery of My Signs and also of the warning they were given.",
    "18:57": "Who could do greater wrong than someone who is reminded of the Signs of his Lord and then turns away from them, forgetting all that he has done before? We have placed covers on their hearts, preventing them from understanding it, and heaviness in their ears. Though you call them to guidance, they will nonetheless never be guided.",

    "18:61": "But when they reached their meeting-place, they forgot their fish which quickly burrowed its way into the sea.",
    "18:62": "When they had gone a distance further on, he said to his servant, 'Bring us our morning meal. Truly this journey of ours has made us tired.'",
    "18:63": "He said, 'Do you see what has happened? When we went to find shelter at the rock, I forgot the fish. No one made me forget to remember it except Shaytan. It found its way into the sea in an amazing way.'",
    "18:64": "He said, 'That is the very thing that we were looking for!' So, following their footsteps, they retraced their route.",
    "18:65": "They found a slave of Ours whom We had granted mercy from Us and whom We had also given knowledge direct from Us.",
    "18:66": "Musa said to him, 'May I follow you on condition that you teach me some of the right guidance you have been taught?'",
    "18:67": "He said, 'You will not be able to bear with me.",
    "18:68": "How indeed could you bear with patience something you have not encompassed in your knowledge?'",
    "18:69": "Musa said, 'You will find me patient, if Allah wills, and I will not disobey you in any matter.'",
    "18:70": "He said, 'Then if you follow me, do not question me about anything until I myself make mention of it to you.'",
    "18:71": "They continued until they boarded a boat and he scuppered it. Then Musa said, 'Did you scupper it so that its owners would be drowned? This is truly a dreadful thing that you have done!'",
    "18:72": "He said, 'Did I not say that you would not be able to bear with me?'",
    "18:73": "Musa said, 'Do not take me to task because I forgot. Do not demand of me something which is too difficult.'",
    "18:74": "So they went on until they met a youngster whom he killed. Musa said, 'Have you killed a boy who has done no wrong, without it being in retaliation for someone else? This is truly an appalling thing that you have done!'",
    "18:75": "He said, 'Did I not tell you that you would not be able to bear with me?'",
    "18:76": "Musa said, 'If I ask you about anything after this, then you should no longer keep me company. I will have given you excuse enough.'",
    "18:77": "So they went on until they reached the inhabitants of a town. They asked them for food but they refused them hospitality. They found there a wall about to fall down and he built it up. Musa said, 'If you had wanted, you could have taken a wage for doing that.'",
    "18:78": "He said, 'This is where you and I part company. I will let you know the explanation of those things about which you were not able to restrain yourself.",
    "18:79": "As for the boat, it belonged to some poor people who worked on the sea. I wanted to damage it because a king was coming behind them, commandeering every boat.",
    "18:80": "As for the boy, his parents were muminun and we feared that he would darken their days with excessive insolence and kufr.",
    "18:81": "We wanted their Lord to give them in exchange a purer son than him, one more compassionate.",
    "18:82": "As for the wall, it belonged to two young orphans in the town and there was a treasure underneath it, belonging to them. Their father was one of the righteous and your Lord wanted them to come of age and then to unearth their treasure as a mercy from your Lord. I did not do it of my own volition. That is the explanation of the things about which you were not able to restrain yourself.'",
    "18:83": "They will ask you about Dhu'l-Qarnayn. Say: 'I will tell you something about him.'",

    "20:101": "remaining in it timelessly, for ever. What an evil load they will bear on the Day of Rising!",
    "20:102": "On the Day the Trumpet is blown - and We will gather the evildoers sightless on that Day -",
    "20:103": "they will whisper secretly to one other, 'You only stayed for ten.'",
    "20:104": "We know best what they will say when the most correct of them will say, 'You only stayed a day.'",
    "20:105": "They will ask you about the mountains. Say: 'My Lord will scatter them as dust.",
    "20:106": "He will leave them as a barren, level plain",
    "20:107": "on which you will see no dip or gradient.'",
    "20:108": "On that day they will follow the Summoner who has no crookedness in him at all. Voices will be humbled before the All-Merciful and nothing but a whisper will be heard.",
    "20:109": "On that Day intercession will not be of any use except for him whom the All-Merciful has authorised and with whose speech He is well-pleased.",
    "20:110": "He knows what is in front of them and behind them. But their knowledge does not encompass Him.",
    "20:111": "Faces will be humbled to the Living, the All-Sustaining, and anyone weighed down with wrongdoing will have failed.",
    "20:112": "But anyone who does right actions, being a mumin, need fear no wrong or any belittlement.",
    "20:113": "In this way We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an and We have made various threats in it so that hopefully they will have taqwa or it will spur them into remembrance.",
    "20:114": "High exalted be Allah, the King, the Real! Do not rush ahead with the Qur'an before its revelation to you is complete, and say: 'My Lord, increase me in knowledge.'",
    "20:115": "We made a contract with Adam before, but he forgot. We did not find that he had a firm resolve.",
    "20:116": "When We said to the angels, 'Prostrate yourselves to Adam!' they prostrated, with the exception of Iblis who disdained to do it.",
    "20:117": "We said, 'Adam, this is an enemy for you and your wife, so do not let him expel you from the Garden and thus make you miserable.",
    "20:118": "You will not go hungry in it or suffer from nakedness.",
    "20:119": "You will not go thirsty in it or burn in the sun.'",
    "20:120": "But Shaytan whispered to him, saying, 'Adam, shall I show you the way to the Tree of Everlasting Life and to a kingdom which will never fade away?'",
    "20:121": "So the two of them ate from it and their private parts were disclosed to them and they started stitching together the leaves of the Garden to cover themselves. Adam disobeyed his Lord and became misled.",
    "20:122": "But then his Lord chose him and turned to him and guided him.",
    "20:123": "He said, 'Go down from it, all of you, as enemies to one another! But when guidance comes to you from",
    "20:124": "But if anyone turns away from My reminder, his life will be a dark and narrow one and on the Day of Rising We will gather him blind.'",
    "20:125": "He will say, 'My Lord, why have you gathered me blind when before I was able to see?'",
    "20:126": "He will say, 'Just as Our Signs came to you and you forgot them, in the same way you too are forgotten today.'",
    "20:127": "That is how We repay anyone who is profligate and does not have iman in the Signs of his Lord. And the punishment of the Next World is much harsher and longer lasting.",
    "20:128": "Are they not guided by the many generations We have destroyed before them, among whose dwelling places they walk about? There are Signs in that for people of sound intellect.",
    "20:129": "And were it not for a prior word from your Lord, and a specified term, it would inevitably have already taken place.",
    "20:130": "So be steadfast in the face of what they say and glorify your Lord with praise before the rising of the sun and before its setting. And glorify Him during part of the night and at both ends of the day, so that hopefully you will be pleased.",
    "20:131": "Do not direct your eyes longingly to what We have given certain of them to enjoy, the flower of the life of this world, so that We can test them by it. Your Lord's provision is better and longer lasting.",
    "20:132": "Instruct your family to do salat, and be constant in it. We do not ask you for provision. We provide for you. And the best end result is gained by taqwa.",
    "20:133": "They say, 'If only he would bring us a Sign from his Lord!' Have they not received the Clear Sign of what is written in the earlier texts?",
    "20:134": "If We had destroyed them with a punishment before this, they would have said. 'Our Lord, why did You not send us a Messenger, so we could follow Your Signs before we were humbled and disgraced?'",
    "20:135": "Say: 'Everyone is waiting expectantly so wait expectantly. You will soon know who are the Companions of the Right Path and who is is guided.'",
    "21:1": "Mankind's Reckoning has drawn very close to them, yet they heedlessly turn away.",
    "21:2": "No fresh reminder comes to them from their Lord without their listening to it as if it was a game.",
    "21:3": "Their hearts are distracted. Those who do wrong confer together secretly, saying, 'Is this man anything but a human being like yourselves? Do you succumb to magic with your eyes wide open?'",
    "21:4": "Say: 'My Lord knows what is said in heaven and earth. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.'",
    "21:5": "Furthermore they say, 'A muddled jumble of dreams!' and, 'He has invented it!' and, 'He is a poet!' and, 'Let him bring us a Sign like those sent to previous peoples.'",
    "21:6": "None of the cities which We destroyed before them had iman. So will they?",
    "21:7": "We have only ever sent before you men who were given Revelation. Ask the People of the Reminder if you do not know.",
    "21:8": "We did not give them bodies which did not eat food, nor were they immortal.",
    "21:9": "But We kept Our promise to them and rescued them and those We willed, and destroyed the profligate.",
    "21:10": "We have sent down to you a Book containing your Reminder. So will you not use your intellect?",
    "21:11": "How many cities which did wrong have We utterly destroyed, raising up other people after them!",
    "21:12": "When they perceived Our violent force they ran away from it.",
    "21:13": "'Do not run away! Return to the life of luxury you enjoyed and to the places where you lived, so that you can be interrogated!'",
    "21:14": "They said, 'Alas for us! We were indeed wrongdoers!'",
    "21:15": "That cry of theirs went on until We made them stubble, silent, stamped out.",
    "21:16": "We did not create heaven and earth and everything in between them as a game.",
    "21:17": "If We had desired to have some amusement, We would have derived it from Our Presence, but We did not do that.",
    "21:18": "Rather We hurl the truth against falsehood and it cuts right through it and it vanishes clean away! Woe without end for you for what you portray!",
    "21:19": "Everyone in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him. Those in His presence do not consider themselves too great to worship Him and do not grow tired of it.",
    "21:20": "They glorify Him by night and day, without ever flagging.",
    "21:21": "Or have they taken gods out of the earth who can bring the dead to life?",
    "21:22": "If there had been any gods besides Allah in heaven or earth, they would both be ruined. Glory be to Allah, Lord of the Throne, beyond what they describe!",
    "21:23": "He will not be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.",
    "21:24": "Or have they taken other gods besides Him? Say: 'Produce your proof! This is the message of those with",
    "21:25": "We sent no Messenger before you without revealing to him: 'There is no god but Me, so worship Me.'",
    "21:26": "They say, 'The All-Merciful has a son.' Glory be to Him! No, they are honoured slaves!",
    "21:27": "They do not precede Him in speech and they act on His command.",
    "21:28": "He knows what is in front of them and what is behind them. They only intercede on behalf of those with whom He is pleased, and even they are apprehensive out of fear of Him.",
    "21:29": "Were any of them to say, 'I am a god apart from Him,' We would repay him with Hell. That is how We repay wrongdoers.",
    "21:30": "Do those who are kafir not see that the heavens and the earth were sewn together and then We unstitched them and that We made from water every living thing? So will they not have iman?",
    "21:31": "We placed firmly embedded mountains on the earth, so it would not move under them, and We put broad valleys as roadways in it, so that perhaps they might be guided.",
    "21:32": "We made the sky a preserved and protected roof yet still they turn away from Our Signs.",
    "21:33": "It is He who created night and day and the sun and moon, each one swimming in a sphere.",
    "21:34": "We did not give any human being before you immortality. And if you die, will they then be immortal?",
    "21:35": "Every self will taste death. We test you with both good and evil as a trial. And you will be returned to Us.",
    "21:36": "When those who are kafir see you, they only make a mockery out of you: 'Is this the one who makes",
    "21:37": "Man was created hasty. I will show you My Signs so do not try to hasten Me.",
    "21:38": "They say, 'When will this promise come about if you are telling the truth?'",
    "21:39": "If those who are kafir only knew of the time when they will not be able to keep the Fire away from their faces or their backs! And they will receive no help!",
    "21:40": "No, it will come upon them suddenly, confounding them, taking them completely by surprise, and they will not be able to ward it off. They will be granted no reprieve.",
    "21:41": "Messengers before you were also mocked, but those who jeered were engulfed by what they mocked.",
    "21:42": "Say: 'Who will protect you night and day from the All-Merciful?' Yet they turn away from the remembrance of their Lord.",
    "21:43": "Or do they have gods besides Us who will protect them? They cannot even help themselves! They will not be safe from Us.",
    "21:44": "No indeed! We have given these people enjoyment, as We did their fathers, until life seemed long and good to them. Do they not see how We come to the land eroding it from its extremities? Or are they the victors?",
    "21:45": "Say: 'I can only warn you through the Revelation.' But the deaf cannot hear the call when they are warned.",
    "21:46": "If even a single waft of the punishment were to touch them, they would say, 'Alas for us! We were indeed wrongdoers.'",
    "21:47": "We will set up the Just Balance on the Day of Rising and no self will be wronged in any way. Even if it is no more than the weight of a grain of mustard-seed, We will produce it. We are sufficient as a Reckoner.",
    "21:48": "We gave to Musa and Harun the Discrimination and a Shining Light and a Reminder for those with taqwa:",
    "21:49": "those who fear their Lord in the Unseen and are apprehensive about the Hour.",
    "21:50": "This is a blessed Reminder which We have sent down. So are you going to ignore it?",
    "21:51": "We gave Ibrahim his right guidance early on, and We had complete knowledge of him.",
    "21:52": "When he said to his father and his people, 'What are these statues you are clinging to?'",
    "21:53": "they said, 'We found our fathers worshipping them.'",
    "21:54": "He said, 'You and your fathers are clearly misguided.'",
    "21:55": "They said, 'Have you brought us the truth or are you playing games?'",
    "21:56": "He said, 'Far from it! Your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, He who brought them into being. I am one of those who bear witness to that.",
    "21:57": "By Allah, I will devise some scheme against your idols when your backs are turned.'",
    "21:58": "He broke them in pieces, except for the biggest one, so that they would have it to consult!",
    "21:59": "They said, 'Who has done this to our gods? He is definitely one of the wrongdoers!'",
    "21:60": "They said, 'We heard a young man mentioning them. They call him Ibrahim.'",
    "21:61": "They said, 'Bring him before the people's eyes so they can be witnesses.'",
    "21:62": "They said, 'Did you do this to our gods, Ibrahim?'",
    "21:63": "He said, 'No, this one, the biggest of them, did it. Ask them if they are able to speak!'",
    "21:64": "They consulted among themselves and said, 'It is you yourselves who are wrongdoers.'",
    "21:65": "But then they relapsed back into their kufr: 'You know full well these idols cannot talk.'",
    "21:66": "He said, 'Do you then worship, instead of Allah, what cannot help or harm you in any way?",
    "21:67": "Shame on you and what you worship besides Allah! Will you not use your intellect?'",
    "21:68": "They said, 'Burn him and support your gods if you are resolved to do something.'",
    "21:69": "We said, 'Fire, be coolness and peace for Ibrahim!'",
    "21:70": "They desired to trap him but We made them the losers.",
    "21:71": "We delivered both him and Lut to the land which We had blessed for all beings.",
    "21:72": "And in addition to that We gave him Ishaq and Ya'qub and made both of them salihun.",
    "21:73": "We made them leaders, guiding by Our command, and revealed to them how to do good actions and establish salat and pay zakat, and they worshipped Us.",
    "21:74": "We gave right judgement and knowledge to Lut and rescued him from the city which committed disgusting acts. They were evil people who were deviators.",
    "21:75": "We admitted him into Our mercy. He was one of the righteoys.",
    "21:76": "And Nuh, when he called out before and We responded to him and rescued him and his family from the terrible plight.",
    "21:77": "We helped him against the people who rejected Our Signs. They were an evil people and We drowned them, every one.",
    "21:78": "And Dawud and Sulayman when they gave judgement about the field, when the people's sheep strayed into it at night. We were Witness to their judgement.",
    "21:79": "We gave Sulayman understanding of it. We gave each of them judgement and knowledge. We subjected the mountains to Dawud, glorifying, and the birds as well. This is something We are well able to do.",
    "21:80": "We taught him the art of making garments for you to protect you against each others' violence, But do you show any thanks?",
    "21:81": "And to Sulayman We gave the fiercely blowing wind, speeding at his command towards the land which We had blessed. And We had full knowledge of everything.",
    "21:82": "And some of the shaytans dived for him and did other things apart from that. And We were watching over them.",
    "21:83": "And Ayyub when he called out to his Lord, 'Great harm has afflicted me and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful,'",
    "21:84": "We responded to him and removed from him the harm which was afflicting him and restored his family to him, and the same again with them, as a mercy direct from Us and a Reminder to all worshippers.",
    "21:85": "And Ismail and Idris and Dhu'l-Kifl - each one was among the steadfast.",
    "21:86": "We admitted them into Our mercy. They were among the righteous.",
    "21:87": "And Dhu'n-Nun when he left in anger and thought We would not punish him. He called out in the pitch darkness: 'There is no god but You! Glory be to You! Truly I have been one of the wrongdoers.'",
    "21:88": "We responded to him and rescued him from his grief. That is how We rescue the muminun.",
    "21:89": "And Zakariyya when he called out to his Lord, 'My Lord, do not leave me on my own, though You are the Best of Inheritors.'",
    "21:90": "We responded to him and gave him Yahya, restoring for him his wife's fertility. They outdid one another in good actions, calling out to Us in yearning and in awe, and humbling themselves to Us.",
    "21:91": "And she who protected her private parts. We breathed into her some of Our Ruh and made her and her son a Sign for all the worlds.",
    "21:92": "This nation of yours is one nation and I am your Lord, so worship Me.",
    "21:93": "But they disagreed and split into different sects. Each one will return to Us.",
    "21:94": "As for anyone who does right actions and is a mumin, his striving certainly does not go unthanked. We are writing it down on his behalf.",
    "21:95": "There is a ban on any city We have destroyed; they will not return.",
    "21:96": "When Yajuj and Majuj are let loose and rush down from every slope,",
    "21:97": "and the True Promise is very close, the eyes of those who were kafir will be transfixed: 'Alas for us! We were unmindful of this! No, rather we were definitely wrongdoers.'",
    "21:98": "You and what you worship besides Allah are fuel for Hell. You will go down into it.",
    "21:99": "If those had really been gods, they would not have gone down into it. Each one will be in it timelessly, for ever.",
    "21:100": "There will be sighing for them in it and they will not be able to hear.",
    "21:101": "Those for whom the Best from Us was pre-ordained, will be far away from it.",
    "21:102": "They will not hear the slightest hint of it and they will remain there timelessly, for ever, among everything their selves desire.",
    "21:103": "The greatest terror will not upset them and the angels will welcome them: 'This is your Day, the one that you were promised.'",
    "21:104": "That Day We will fold up heaven like folding up the pages of a book. As We originated the first creation so We will regenerate it. It is a promise binding on Us. That is what We will do.",
    "21:105": "We wrote down in the Zabur, after the Reminder came: 'It is My slaves who are salihun who will inherit the righteous.'",
    "21:106": "Certainly there is a transmission in this for people who worship.",
    "21:107": "We have only sent you as a mercy to all the worlds.",
    "21:108": "Say: 'It is revealed to me that your god is One God. So are you Muslims?'",
    "21:109": "If they turn their backs, then say: 'I have informed all of you equally and I do not know if what you have been promised is near or far.",
    "21:110": "He knows what is said openly and He knows what you hide.",
    "21:111": "For all I know it might be a trial for you and you will have enjoyment for a time.'",
    "21:112": "Say: 'Lord, judge with truth! Our Lord is the All-Merciful, the One whose help is sought in the face of what you describe.'",
    "22:1": "Mankind, have taqwa of your Lord! The quaking of the Hour is a terrible thing.",
    "22:2": "On the day they see it, every nursing woman will be oblivious of the baby at her breast, and every pregnant woman will abort the contents of her womb, and you will think people drunk when they are not drunk; it is just that the punishment of Allah is so severe.",
    "22:3": "Among people there is one who argues about Allah without knowledge, and follows every rebellious shaytan.",
    "22:4": "It is written of him that if anyone takes him as a friend, he will mislead him and guide him to the punishment of the Searing Blaze.",
    "22:5": "Mankind! if you are in any doubt about the Rising, know that We created you from dust then from a drop of sperm then from a clot of blood then from a lump of flesh, formed yet unformed, so We may make things clear to you. We make whatever We want stay in the womb until a specified time and then We bring you out as children so that you can reach your full maturity. Some of you die and some of you revert to the lowest form of life so that, after having knowledge, they then know nothing at all. And you see the earth dead and barren; then when We send down water onto it it quivers and swells and sprouts with luxuriant plants of every kind.",
    "22:6": "That is because Allah is the Real and gives life to the dead and has power over all things",
    "22:7": "and the Hour is coming without any doubt and Allah will raise up all those in the graves.",
    "22:8": "Among people there is one who argues about Allah without knowledge or guidance or any light-giving Book,",
    "22:9": "turning away arrogantly, to misguide people from the Way of Allah. He will be disgraced in this world and on the Day of Rising We will make him taste the punishment of the Burning:",
    "22:10": "That is for what you did before. Allah does not wrong His slaves.'",
    "22:11": "Among the people there is one who worships Allah right on the edge. If good befalls him, he is content with it, but if a trial befalls him, he reverts to his former ways, losing both this world and the Next World. That is indeed sheer loss.",
    "22:12": "Instead of Allah, he calls on something which cannot harm him or help him. That is extreme misguidance.",
    "22:13": "He calls on what is far more likely to harm than help. What an evil protector! What an evil associate!",
    "22:14": "Allah will admit those who have iman and do right actions into Gardens with rivers flowing under them. Allah does whatever He wishes.",
    "22:15": "Anyone who thinks that Allah will not help him in this world and the Next World should stretch a rope up to the ceiling and then hang himself. Let him see whether his stratagem gets rid of what enrages him!",
    "22:16": "In this way We have sent it down as Clear Signs. Allah guides anyone He wills.",
    "22:17": "As for those who have iman and those who are Jews and the Sabaeans and the Christians, Magians and idolaters, Allah will distinguish between them on the Day of Rising. Allah is witness of all things.",
    "22:18": "Do you not see that everyone in the heavens and everyone on the earth prostrates to Allah, and the sun and moon and stars and the mountains, trees and beasts and many of mankind? But many of them inevitably",
    "22:19": "Here are two rival groups who disputed concerning their Lord. Those who are kafir will have garments of fire cut out for them, and boiling water poured over their heads,",
    "22:20": "which will melt the contents of their bellies as well as their skin,",
    "22:21": "and they will be beaten with cudgels made of iron.",
    "22:22": "Every time they want to come out of it. because of their suffering, they will be driven back into it: 'Taste the punishment of the Burning!'",
    "22:23": "But Allah will admit those who have iman and do right actions into Gardens with rivers flowing under them where they will be adorned with gold bracelets and pearls, and where their clothing will be of silk.",
    "22:24": "They have been guided to speak good words and guided to the praiseworthy path.",
    "22:25": "Those who are kafir and bar access to the Way of Allah and to the Masjid al-Haram which We have appointed for all mankind - equally for those who live near it and those who come from far away - those who desire to profane it with wrongdoing, We will let them taste a painful punishment.",
    "22:26": "And We located the position of the House for Ibrahim: 'Do not associate anything with Me and purify My House for those who circle it, and those who stand and bow and prostrate.",
    "22:27": "Announce the Hajj to mankind. They will come to you on foot and on every sort of lean animal, coming by every distant road",
    "22:28": "so that they can be present at what will profit them and invoke Allah's name on specific days over livestock He has provided for them. Eat of them and feed those who are poor and in need.",
    "22:29": "Then they should end their state of self-neglect and fufil their vows and circle the Ancient House.'",
    "22:30": "That is it. If someone honours Allah's sacred things, that is better for him in his Lord's sight. All livestock are permitted to you except what has already been recited to you. Have done with the defilement of idols and have done with telling lies.",
    "22:31": "Be people of pure natural belief in Allah, not associating anything else with Him. As for anyone who associates others with Allah, it is as though he had fallen from the sky and the birds had seized him and carried him away or the wind had dropped him in a distant place.",
    "22:32": "That is it. As for those who honour Allah's sacred rites, that comes from the taqwa in their hearts.",
    "22:33": "You can make use of the sacrificial animals until a specified time, and then their place of sacrifice is by the Ancient House.",
    "22:34": "We have appointed a rite of sacrifice for every nation so that they may invoke Allah's name over the livestock He has given them. Your God is One God so submit to Him. Give good news to the humble-hearted,",
    "22:35": "whose hearts quake at the mention of Allah, and who are steadfast in the face of all that happens to them, those who establish salat and give of what We have provided for them.",
    "22:36": "We have appointed the sacrificial animals for you as one of the sacred rites of Allah. There is good in them for you, so invoke Allah's name over them, as they stand in rows. And then when they collapse on their sides, eat of them and feed both those who ask and those who are too shy to ask. In this way We have subjected them to you so that hopefully you will be thankful.",
    "22:37": "Their flesh and blood does not reach Allah but your taqwa does reach Him. In this way He has subjected them to you so that you might proclaim Allah's greatness for the way that He has guided you. Give good news to the good-doers.",
    "22:38": "Allah will defend those who have iman. Allah does not love any thankless traitor.",
    "22:39": "Permission to fight is given to those who are fought against because they have been wronged - truly Allah has the power to come to their support -",
    "22:40": "those who were expelled from their homes without any right, merely for saying, 'Our Lord is Allah' (if Allah had not driven some people back by means of others, monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques, where Allah's name is mentioned much, would have been pulled down and destroyed. Allah will certainly help those who help Him - Allah is All-Strong, Almighty),",
    "22:41": "those who, if We establish them firmly on the earth, will establish salat and pay zakat, and command what is right and forbid what is wrong. The end result of all affairs is with Allah.",
    "22:42": "If they deny you, the people of Nuh before them denied him and those of 'Ad and of Thamud",
    "22:43": "and the people of Ibrahim and the people of Lut",
    "22:44": "and the companions of Madyan; and Musa was denied as well. I allowed time to the kafirun but then I seized them. How terrible was My denial!",
    "22:45": "How many wrongdoing cities We destroyed, and now all their roofs and walls are fallen in; how many abandoned wells and stuccoed palaces!",
    "22:46": "Have they not travelled about the earth and do they not have hearts to understand with or ears to hear with? It is not their eyes which are blind but the hearts in their breasts which are blind.",
    "22:47": "They ask you to hasten the punishment. Allah will not break His promise. A day with your Lord is equivalent to a thousand years in the way you count.",

    "28:40": "So We seized him and his troops and flung them into the sea. See the final fate of the wrongdoers!",

    "28:42": "We pursued them with a curse in this world and on the Day of Rising they will be hideous and spurned.",
    "28:43": "We gave Musa the Book after destroying the earlier nations, to awaken people's hearts and as a guidance and a mercy so that hopefully they would pay heed.",
    "28:44": "You were not on the western side when We gave Musa the command. You were not a witness.",

    "28:48": "But when the truth did come to them from Us they said, 'Why has he not been given the same as Musa was given?' But did they not previously reject what Musa was given? They say, 'Two magicians who back each other up.' And they say, 'We reject both of them.'",
    "28:49": "Say: 'Bring a Book, then, from Allah which guides better than both of them and follow it if you are telling the truth.'",
    "28:50": "If they do not respond to you then know that they are merely following their whims and desires. And who could be further astray than someone who follows his whims and desires without any guidance from Allah? Allah does not guide the people of the wrongdoers.",
    "28:51": "We have conveyed the Word to them so that hopefully they will pay heed.",
    "28:52": "Those We gave the Book before this have iman in it.",

    "28:57": "They say, 'If we follow the guidance with you, we shall be forcibly uprooted from our land.' Have We not established a safe haven for them to which produce of every kind is brought, provision direct from Us? But",
    "28:58": "How many cities We have destroyed which lived in insolent ingratitude! There are their houses, never again inhabited after them, except a little. It was We who were their Heir.",
    "28:59": "Your Lord would never destroy any cities without first sending to the chief of them a Messenger to recite Our Signs to them. We would never destroy any cities unless their inhabitants were wrongdoers.",
    "28:60": "Anything you have been given is only the enjoyment of the life of this world and its finery. What is with Allah is better and longer lasting. So will you not use your intellect?",

    "28:66": "That Day the facts will be unclear to them and they will not be able to question one another.",
    "28:67": "But as for those who make tawba and believe and act rightly, they will hopefully be successful.",

    "28:73": "But part of His mercy is that He has made both night and day for you so that you can have your rest and seek His bounty, and so that hopefully you will be thankful.",
    "28:74": "On the Day when He summons them He will say, 'Where are they, those you claimed to be My associates?'",
    "28:75": "We will drag out a witness from each nation and will say, 'Produce your evidence!' They will know then that the truth is with Allah and that what they invented has forsaken them.",
    "28:76": "Qarun was one of the people of Musa but he lorded it over them. We gave him treasures, the keys alone to which were a heavy weight for a party of strong men. When his people said to him, 'Do not gloat. Allah does not love people who gloat.",

    "28:78": "he said, 'I have only been given it because of knowledge I have.' Did he not know that before him Allah had destroyed generations with far greater strength than his and far more possessions? The evildoers will not be questioned about their sins.",
    "28:79": "He went out among his people in his finery. Those who desired the life of this world said, 'Oh! If only we had the same as Qarun has been given! What immense good fortune he possesses.'",
    "28:80": "But those who had been given knowledge said, 'Woe to you! Allah's reward is better for those who have iman and act rightly. But only the steadfast will obtain it.'",
    "28:81": "We caused the earth to swallow up both him and his house. There was no group to come to his aid, besides Allah, and he was not someone who is helped.",
    "28:82": "Those who had longed to take his place the day before woke up saying, 'Allah expands the provision of any of His slaves He wills or restricts it. If Allah had not shown great kindness to us, we would have been swallowed up as well. Ah! Truly the kafirun are not successful.'",
    "28:83": "That abode of the Next World- We grant it to those who do not seek to exalt themselves in the earth or to cause corruption in it. The successful outcome is for those who have taqwa.",
    "28:84": "Anyone who does a good action will get something better. As for anyone who does a bad action, those who have done bad actions will only be repaid for what they did.",
    "28:85": "He who has imposed the Qur'an upon you will most certainly bring you back home again. Say: 'My Lord knows best who has brought true guidance and who is plainly misguided.'",

    "29:24": "The only answer of his people was to say: 'Kill him or burn him!' But Allah rescued him from the fire. There are certainly Signs in that for people who are muminun.",
    "29:25": "He said, 'You have adopted idols apart from Allah as tokens of mutual affection in this world. But then on the Day of Rising you will reject one another and curse one another. The Fire will be your shelter. You will have no helpers.'",
    "29:26": "And Lut had iman in him. He said, 'I am leaving this place to follow the pleasure of my Lord. He is the Almighty, the All Wise.'",
    "29:27": "We gave him Ishaq and Ya'qub and placed Prophethood and the Book among his progeny. We gave him his reward in this world and in the Next World he will be among the righteous.",

    "29:37": "But they denied him so the earthquake seized them and morning found them lying flattened in their homes.",
    "29:38": "And 'Ad and Thamud - it must be clear to you from their dwelling places! Shaytan made their actions seem good to them and so debarred them from the Way, even though they were intelligent people.",

    "29:40": "We seized each one of them for their wrong actions. Against some We sent a sudden squall of stones; some of them were seized by the Great Blast; some We caused the earth to swallow up; and some We drowned. Allah did not wrong them; rather they wronged themselves.",
    "29:41": "The metaphor of those who take protectors besides Allah is that of a spider which builds itself a house; but no house is flimsier than a spider's house, if they only knew.",

    "34:32": "Those deemed great will say to those deemed weak, 'Did we debar you from the guidance when it came to you? No, it is you who were evildoers.'",
    "34:33": "Those deemed weak will say to those deemed great, 'No, it was your scheming night and day when you commanded us to reject Allah and assign equals to Him.' But they will show their remorse when they see the punishment. We will put iron collars round the necks of those who are kafir. Will they be repaid for anything but what they did?",
    "34:34": "We never sent a warner into any city without the affluent people in it saying, 'We reject what you have been sent with.'",
    "34:35": "They also said, 'We have more wealth and children. We are not going to be punished.'",
    "34:36": "Say: 'My Lord expands the provision of anyone He wills or restricts it. But the majority of mankind do not know it.'",
    "34:37": "It is not your wealth or your children that will bring you near to Us - only in the case of people who have iman and act rightly; such people will have a double recompense for what they did. They will be safe from all harm in the High Halls of Paradise.",
    "34:38": "But people who strive against Our Signs, trying to nullify them, such people will be summoned to the punishment.",
    "34:39": "Say: 'My Lord expands the provision of any of His slaves He wills or restricts it. But anything you expend will be replaced by Him. He is the Best of Providers.'",
    "34:40": "On the Day We gather them all together and then say to the angels, 'Was it you whom these people were worshipping?'",
    "34:41": "they will say, 'Glory be to You! You are our Protector, not them. No, they were worshipping the jinn. They",
    "34:42": "'Today you possess no power to help or harm one another.' And We will say to those who did wrong, 'Taste the punishment of the Fire which you denied.'",
    "34:43": "When Our Clear Signs are recited to them, they say, 'This is nothing but a man who wants to debar you from what your fathers used to worship.' They say, 'This is nothing but an invented lie.' Those who are kafir say to the truth when it comes to them, 'This is nothing but downright magic'",
    "34:44": "We have not given them any books which they are studying nor did We send, before you, any warner to them.",
    "34:45": "Those before them also denied the truth but these people do not have even a tenth of what We gave to them. They denied My Messengers. And how complete was My denial!",
    "34:46": "Say: 'I exhort you to do one thing alone: to stand before Allah in pairs and on your own and then reflect. Your companion is not possessed. He is only a warner come to you ahead of a terrible punishment.'",
    "34:47": "Say: 'I have not asked you for any wage - it is all for you. My wage is the responsibility of Allah alone. He is witness of everything.'",
    "34:48": "Say: 'My Lord hurls forth the Truth - the Knower of all unseen things.'",
    "34:49": "Say: 'The Truth has come. Falsehood cannot originate or regenerate.'",
    "34:50": "Say: 'If I am misguided, it is only to my detriment. But if I am guided, it is by what my Lord reveals to me. He is All-Hearing, Close-at-hand.'",
    "34:51": "If you could only see when they are terrified, and there is no way out, and they are seized from a nearby place.",
    "34:52": "They will say, 'We have iman in it,' but how can they reach out for it from a distant place -",
    "34:53": "when beforehand they had rejected it, shooting forth about the Unseen from a distant place?",
    "34:54": "A barrier will be set up between them and the thing that they desire, just as was done with their kind before. They too were in a state of crippling doubt.",
    "35:1": "Praise be to Allah, the Bringer into Being of the heavens and earth, He who made the angels messengers, with wings - two, three or four. He adds to creation in any way He wills. Allah has power over all things.",
    "35:2": "Any mercy Allah opens up to people, no one can withhold, and any He withholds, no one can afterwards release. He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.",
    "35:3": "Mankind! remember Allah's blessing to you. Is there any creator other than Allah providing for you from heaven and earth? There is no god but Him. So how have you been perverted?",
    "35:4": "If they deny you, Messengers before you were also denied. All matters return to Allah.",
    "35:5": "Mankind! Allah's promise is true. Do not let the life of the dunya delude you and do not let the Deluder delude you about Allah.",
    "35:6": "Shaytan is your enemy so treat him as an enemy. He summons his party so they will be among the people of the Searing Blaze.",
    "35:7": "Those who are kafir will suffer a harsh punishment. But those who have iman and do right actions will receive forgiveness and an immense reward.",
    "35:8": "And what of him the evil of whose actions appears fine to him so that he sees them as good? Allah them. Allah knows what they do.",
    "35:9": "It is Allah who sends the winds which raise the clouds which We then drive to a dead land and by them bring the earth to life after it was dead. That is how the Resurrection will be.",
    "35:10": "If anyone wants power, all power belongs to Allah. All good words rise to Him and virtuous deeds elevate them. But people who plot evil deeds will suffer a harsh punishment. The plotting of such people is profitless.",
    "35:11": "Allah created you from dust and then from a drop of sperm and then made you into pairs. No female becomes pregnant or gives birth except with His knowledge. And no living thing lives long or has its life cut short without that being in a Book. That is easy for Allah.",
    "35:12": "The two seas are not the same: the one is sweet, refreshing, delicious to drink, the other salty, bitter to the taste. Yet from both of them you eat fresh flesh and extract ornaments for yourselves to wear; and you see ships on them, cleaving through the waves so that you can seek His bounty and so that hopefully you will be thankful.",
    "35:13": "He makes night merge into day and day merge into night, and He has made the sun and moon subservient, each one running until a specified time. That is Allah, your Lord. The Kingdom is His. Those you call on besides Him have no power over even the smallest speck.",
    "35:14": "If you call on them they will not hear your call, and were they to hear, they would not respond to you. On the Day of Rising they will reject your making associates of them. No one can inform you like One who is All- aware.",
    "35:15": "Mankind! you are the poor in need of Allah whereas Allah is the Rich Beyond Need, the Praiseworthy.",
    "35:16": "If He wills He can dispense with you and bring about a new creation.",
    "35:17": "That is not difficult for Allah.",
    "35:18": "No burden-bearer can bear another's burden. If someone weighed down calls for help to bear his load, none of it will be borne for him, even by his next of kin. You can only warn those who fear their Lord in the Unseen and establish salat. Whoever is purified, is purified for himself alone. Allah is your final destination.",
    "35:19": "The blind and seeing are not the same",
    "35:20": "nor are darkness and light",
    "35:21": "nor are cool shade and fierce heat.",
    "35:22": "The living and dead are not the same. Allah makes anyone He wills hear but you cannot make those in the grave hear.",
    "35:23": "You are only a warner.",
    "35:24": "We have sent you with the truth bringing good news and giving warning. There is no community to which a warner has not come.",
    "35:25": "If they deny you, those before them also denied the truth. Their Messengers came to them with Clear Signs, and psalms and the Illuminating Book.",
    "35:26": "Then I seized hold of those who were kafir and how absolute was My rejection!",
    "35:27": "Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the sky and by it We bring forth fruits of varying colours? And in the mountains there are streaks of white and red, of varying shades, and rocks of deep jet black.",
    "35:28": "And mankind and beasts and livestock are likewise of varying colours. Only those of His slaves with knowledge have fear of Allah. Allah is Almighty, Ever-Forgiving.",
    "35:29": "Those who recite the Book of Allah and establish salat and give of what We have provided for them, secretly and openly, hope for a transaction which will not prove profitless:",
    "35:30": "that He will pay them their wages in full and give them more from His unbounded favour. He is Ever- Forgiving, Ever-Thankful.",
    "35:31": "What We have revealed to you of the Book is the truth, confirming what came before it. Allah is aware of and sees His slaves.",
    "35:32": "Then We made Our chosen slaves inherit the Book. But some of them wrong themselves; some are ambivalent; and some outdo each other in good by Allah's permission. That is the great favour.",
    "35:33": "They will enter Gardens of Eden where they will be adorned with gold bracelets and pearls, and where their clothing will be of silk.",
    "35:34": "They will say, 'Praise be to Allah who has removed all sadness from us. Truly our Lord is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Thankful:",
    "35:35": "He who has lodged us, out of His favour, in the Abode of Permanence where no weariness or fatigue affects us.'",
    "35:36": "Whereas for those who are kafir there will be the Fire of Hell. They will not be killed off so that they die and its punishment will not be lightened for them. That is how We repay every thankless man.",
    "35:37": "They will shout out in it, 'Our Lord! take us out! We will act rightly, differently from the way we used to act!' Did We not let you live long enough for anyone who was going to pay heed to pay heed? And did not the warner come to you? Taste it then! There is no helper for the wrongdoers.",
    "35:38": "Allah knows the Unseen of the heavens and earth. Allah knows what the heart contains.",
    "35:39": "It is He who made you khalifs on the earth. So whoever is kafir, his kufr is against himself. In Allah's sight, the kufr of the kafirun only increases their loathsomeness; the kufr of the kafirun only increases their loss.",
    "35:40": "Say: 'Have you thought about your partner gods, those you call upon besides Allah? Show me what they have created of the earth; or do they have a partnership in the heavens?' Have We given them a Book whose Clear Signs they follow? No indeed! The wrongdoers promise each other nothing but delusion.",
    "35:41": "Allah keeps a firm hold on the heavens and earth, preventing them from vanishing away. And if they vanished no one could then keep hold of them. Certainly He is Most Forbearing, Ever-Forgiving.",
    "35:42": "They swore by Allah with their most earnest oaths that if a warner came to them they would be better guided than any other community. But then when a warner did come to them, it only increased their aversion,",
    "35:43": "shown by their arrogance in the land and evil plotting. But evil plotting envelops only those who do it. Do they expect anything but the pattern of previous peoples? You will not find any changing in the pattern of Allah. You will not find any alteration in the pattern of Allah.",
    "35:44": "Have they not travelled in the land and seen the final fate of those before them? They were far greater than them in strength. Allah cannot be withstood in any way, either in the heavens or on earth. He is All- Knowing, Ail-Powerful.",
    "35:45": "If Allah were to take mankind to task for what they have earned, He would not leave a single creature crawling on it, but He is deferring them until a specified time. Then, when their time comes, Allah sees His slaves!",
    "36:1": "Ya Sin.",
    "36:2": "By the Wise Qur'an.",
    "36:3": "Truly you are one of the Messengers",
    "36:4": "on a Straight Path.",
    "36:5": "The revelation of the Almighty, the Most Merciful",
    "36:6": "so that you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned and who are therefore unaware.",
    "36:7": "The Word has been justly carried out against most of them so they have no iman.",
    "36:8": "We have put iron collars round their necks reaching up to the chin, so that their heads are forced back.",
    "36:9": "We have placed a barrier in front of them and a barrier behind them, blindfolding them so that they cannot see.",
    "36:10": "It makes no difference to them whether you warn them or do not warn them: they will not have iman.",
    "36:11": "You can only warn those who act on the Reminder and fear the All-Merciful in the Unseen. Give them the good news of forgiveness and a generous reward.",
    "36:12": "We bring the dead to life and We record what they send ahead and what they leave behind. We have listed everything in a clear register.",
    "36:13": "Make an example for them of the inhabitants of the city when the Messengers came to it.",
    "36:14": "When We sent them two and they denied them both, so We reinforced them with a third. They said, 'Truly We have been sent to you as Messengers.'",
    "36:15": "They said, 'You are nothing but human beings like ourselves. The All-Merciful has not sent down anything. You are simply lying.'",
    "36:16": "They said, 'Our Lord knows we have been sent as Messengers to you.",
    "36:17": "We are only responsible for clear transmission.'",
    "36:18": "They said, 'We see an evil omen in you. If you do not stop we will stone you and you will suffer a painful punishment at our hands.'",
    "36:19": "They said, 'Your evil omen is in yourselves. Is it not just that you have been reminded? No, you are an unbridled people!'",
    "36:20": "A man came running from the far side of the city, saying, 'My people! follow the Messengers!",
    "36:21": "Follow those who do not ask you for any wage and who have received guidance.",
    "36:22": "Why indeed should I not worship Him Who brought me into being, Him to Whom you will be returned?",
    "36:23": "Am I to take as gods instead of Him those whose intercession, if the All-Merciful desires harm for me, will not help me at all and cannot save me?",
    "36:24": "In that case I would clearly be misguided.",
    "36:25": "I have iman in your Lord so listen to me!'",
    "36:26": "He was told, 'Enter the Garden!' He said, 'If my people only knew",
    "36:27": "how my Lord has forgiven me and placed me among the honoured ones!'",
    "36:28": "We did not send down to his people any host from heaven after him nor would We send one down.",
    "36:29": "It was but one Great Blast and they were extinct.",
    "36:30": "Alas for My slaves! No Messenger comes to them without their mocking him.",
    "36:31": "Do they not see how many generations before them We have destroyed and that they will not return to them?",
    "36:32": "Each and every one will be summoned to Our presence.",
    "36:33": "A Sign for them is the dead land which We bring to life and from which We bring forth grain of which they eat.",
    "36:34": "We place in it gardens of dates and grapes, and cause springs to gush out in it,",
    "36:35": "so they may eat its fruits - they did not do it themselves. So will they not be thankful?",
    "36:36": "Glory be to Him who created all the pairs: from what the earth produces and from themselves and from things unknown to them.",
    "36:37": "A Sign for them is the night: We peel the day away from it and there they are in darkness.",
    "36:38": "And the sun runs to its resting place. That is the decree of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.",
    "36:39": "And We have decreed set phases for the moon, until it ends up looking like an old palm spathe.",
    "36:40": "It is not for the sun to overtake the moon nor for the night to outstrip the day; each one is swimming in a sphere.",
    "36:41": "A Sign for them is that We carried their families in the laden ship.",
    "36:42": "And We have created for them the like of it in which they sail.",
    "36:43": "If We wished, We could drown them with no one to hear their cry, and then they would not be saved -",
    "36:44": "except as an act of mercy from Us, to give them enjoyment for a time.",
    "36:45": "They are told, 'Have taqwa of what is before you and behind you so that hopefully you will have mercy shown to you.'",
    "36:46": "Not one of your Lord's Signs comes to them without their turning away from it.",
    "36:47": "And when they are told, 'Spend from the provision Allah has given you,' those who are kafir say to those who have iman, 'Why should we feed someone whom, if He wished, Allah would feed Himself? You are clearly in error.'",
    "36:48": "And they say, 'When will this promise come about if you are telling the truth?'",
    "36:49": "What are they waiting for but one Great Blast to seize them while they are quibbling?",
    "36:50": "They will not be able to make a will or return to their families.",
    "36:51": "The Trumpet will be blown and at once they will be sliding from their graves towards their Lord.",
    "36:52": "They will say, 'Alas for us! Who has raised us from our resting-place? This is what the All-Merciful promised us. The Messengers were telling the truth.'",
    "36:53": "It will be but one Great Blast, and they will all be summoned to Our presence.",
    "36:54": "Today no self will be wronged in any way. You will only be repaid for what you did.",
    "36:55": "The Companions of the Garden are busy enjoying themselves today,",
    "36:56": "they and their wives reclining on couches in the shade.",

    "36:61": "but to worship Me? That is a straight path.",
    "36:62": "He has led huge numbers of you into error. Why did you not use your intellect?",

    "36:65": "Today We seal up their mouths and their hands speak to us, and their feet bear witness to what they have earned.",

    "36:67": "If We wished, We could transform them where they stand so they would neither be able to go out nor return.",
    "36:68": "When We grant long life to people, We return them to their primal state. So will you not use your intellect?",
    "36:69": "We did not teach him poetry nor would it be right for him. It is simply a reminder and a clear Qur'an",
    "36:70": "so that you may warn those who are truly alive and so that the Word may be carried out against the kafirun.",
    "36:71": "Have they not seen how We created for them, by Our own handiwork, livestock which are under their control?",
    "36:72": "We have made them tame for them and some they ride and some they eat.",
    "36:73": "And they have other uses for them, and milk to drink. So will they not be thankful?",
    "36:74": "They have taken gods besides Allah so that perhaps they may be helped.",
    "36:75": "They cannot help them even though they are an army mobilised in their support.",

    "38:62": "They will say, 'How is it that we do not see some men whom we used to count among the worst of people?",
    "38:63": "Did we turn them into figures of fun? Did our eyes disdain to look at them?'",
    "38:64": "All this is certainly true - the bickering of the people of the Fire.",

    "38:76": "He said, 'I am better than him. You created me from fire but You created him from clay.'",
    "38:77": "He said, 'Get out! you are accursed!",
    "38:78": "My curse is upon you until the Day of Reckoning.'",
    "38:79": "He said, 'My Lord, grant me a reprieve until the Day they are raised again.'",
    "38:80": "He said, 'You are among the reprieved",
    "38:81": "until the Day whose time is known.'",
    "38:82": "He said, 'By Your might, I will mislead all of them",
    "38:83": "except for Your chosen slaves among them.'",
    "38:84": "He said, 'By the truth - and I speak the truth -",

    "39:3": "Indeed is the sincere deen not Allah's alone? If people take protectors besides Him - 'We only worship them so that they may bring us nearer to Allah' - Allah will judge between them regarding the things about which they differed. Allah does not guide anyone who is an ungrateful liar.",
    "39:4": "If Allah had desired to have a son He would have chosen whatever He wished from what He has created. Glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the All-Conquering.",
    "39:5": "He created the heavens and the earth with truth. He wraps the night around the day and wraps the day around the night, and has made the sun and moon subservient, each one running for a specified term. Is He not indeed the Almighty, the Endlessly Forgiving?",
    "39:6": "He created you from a single self, then produced its mate from it, and sent down livestock to you - eight kinds in pairs. He creates you stage by stage in your mothers' wombs in a threefold darkness. That is Allah, your Lord. Sovereignty is His. There is no god but Him. So what has made you deviate?",
    "39:7": "If you are ungrateful, Allah is rich beyond need of any of you and He is not pleased with ingratitude in His slaves. But if you are grateful, He is pleased with you for that. No burden-bearer can bear another's burden. Then you will return to your Lord and He will inform you of what you did. He knows what the heart contains.",
    "39:8": "When harm touches man he calls upon his Lord, making tawba to Him. Then when He grants him a blessing from Him, he forgets what he was calling for before and ascribes rivals to Allah, so as to misguide others from His Way. Say: 'Enjoy your kufr for a little while. You are among the Companions of the Fire.'",
    "39:9": "What of him who spends the night hours in prayer, prostrating and standing up, mindful of the Next World, hoping for the mercy of his Lord? Say: 'Are they the same - those who know and those who do not know?' It is only people of intelligence who pay heed.",
    "39:10": "Say: 'Slaves of Mine who have iman! have taqwa of your Lord. For those who do good in this world there is good and Allah's earth is spacious. The steadfast will be paid their wages in full without any reckoning.'",

    "39:14": "Say: 'It is Allah I worship, making my deen sincerely His,",
    "39:15": "so worship anything you will apart from Him!' Say: 'The real losers are those who lose themselves and their families on the Day of Rising.' Is not that clear loss?",
    "39:16": "They will have awnings of Fire above them and awnings below them. By that Allah strikes fear into His slaves: 'So have taqwa, My slaves, of Me!'",
    "39:17": "Those who shun the worship of false gods and turn towards Allah will have good news. So give good news to My slaves.",
    "39:18": "Those who listen well to what is said and follow the best of it, they are the ones whom Allah has guided, they are the people of intelligence.",
    "39:19": "But as for those against whom the decree of Punishment is justly carried out, can you rescue those who are in the Fire?",
    "39:20": "But those who have taqwa of their Lord will have high-ceilinged Halls, and more such Halls built one above the other, and rivers flowing under them. That is Allah's promise. Allah does not break His promise.",
    "39:21": "Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the sky and threads it through the earth to emerge as springs and then by it brings forth crops of varying colours, which then wither and you see them turning yellow and then He makes them into broken stubble? There is a reminder in that for people of intelligence.",
    "39:22": "Is he whose breast is opened to Islam, and who is therefore illuminated by his Lord . . . ? Woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of Allah! Such people are clearly misguided.",
    "39:23": "Allah has sent down the Supreme Discourse, a Book consistent in its frequent repetitions. The skins of those who fear their Lord tremble at it and then their skins and hearts yield softly to the remembrance of Allah. That is Allah's guidance by which He guides whoever He wills. And no one can guide those whom Allah",
    "39:24": "Is someone who tries to shield himself with his face from the worst of the torment on the Day of Rising . . . ? The wrongdoers will be told, Taste what you have earned.'",
    "39:25": "Those before them also denied the truth and the punishment came upon them from where they did not expect.",
    "39:26": "So Allah made them taste disgrace in the life of this world and the punishment of the Next World is far worse if they only knew.",
    "39:27": "We have given all kinds of examples to people in this Qur'an, so that hopefully they will pay heed -",
    "39:28": "an Arabic Qur'an with no distortion in it, so that hopefully they will have taqwa.",
    "39:29": "Allah has made a metaphor for them of a man owned by several partners in dispute with one another and another man wholly owned by a single man. Are they the same? Praise be to Allah! The fact is that most of them do not know.",
    "39:30": "You will die and they too will die.",
    "39:31": "Then on the Day of Rising you will argue in the presence of your Lord.",
    "39:32": "Who could do greater wrong than those who lie about Allah and deny the truth when it comes to them? Do the kuffar not have a dwelling place in Hell?",
    "39:33": "He who brings the truth and those who confirm it - those are the people who have taqwa.",
    "39:34": "They will have anything they wish for with their Lord. That is the recompense of the good-doers.",
    "39:35": "So that Allah may erase from them the worst of what they did and pay them their wages for the best of what they did.",
    "39:36": "Is Allah not enough for His slave? Yet they try to scare you with others apart from Him. If Allah misguides someone, he has no guide",
    "39:37": "and if Allah guides someone, he cannot be misguided. Is Allah not Almighty, Exactor of Revenge?",
    "39:38": "If you ask them, 'Who created the heavens and the earth?' they will say, 'Allah.' Say: 'So what do you think? If Allah desires harm for me, can those you call upon besides Allah remove His harm? Or if He desires trust in Him.'",
    "39:39": "Say: 'My people, do as you think best; that is what I am doing. You will soon know",
    "39:40": "who will receive a punishment which disgraces him and will unleash against himself an everlasting punishment.'",
    "39:41": "We have sent down to you the Book for mankind with truth. So whoever is guided is guided to his own good and whoever is misguided, it is to his detriment. You are not set over them as a guardian.",
    "39:42": "Allah takes back people's souls when their death arrives and those who have not yet died, while they are asleep. He keeps hold of those whose death has been decreed and sends the others back for a specified term. There are certainly Signs in that for people who reflect.",
    "39:43": "Or have they adopted intercessors besides Allah? Say: 'Even though they do not control a thing and have no awareness?'",
    "39:44": "Say: 'Intercession is entirely Allah's affair. The kingdom of the heavens and earth is His. Then you will be returned to Him.'",
    "39:45": "When Allah is mentioned on His own, the hearts of those who do not believe in the akhira shrink back shuddering, but when others apart from Him are mentioned, they jump for joy.",
    "39:46": "Say: 'O Allah. Originator of the heavens and the earth. Knower of the Unseen and the Visible. You will judge between Your slaves regarding what they differed about.'",
    "39:47": "If those who did wrong owned everything on earth, and the same again with it, they would offer it as a ransom to save themselves from the evil of the punishment on the Day of Rising. What confronts them from Allah will be something they did not reckon with.",
    "39:48": "What confronts them will be the evil actions which they earned and what they used to mock at will engulf them.",
    "39:49": "When harm touches man he calls on Us. Then when We grant him a blessing from Us he says, 'I have only been given this because of my knowledge.' In fact it is a trial but most of them do not know it.",
    "39:50": "Those who came before them also said that, but what they earned did not avail them.",
    "39:51": "The evil deeds they earned caught up with them. And the evil deeds which the wrongdoers among these people earn will also catch up with them and they can do nothing to prevent it.",
    "39:52": "Do they not know that Allah expands the provision of anyone He wills and restricts it? There are certainly Signs in that for people who have iman.",

They will say, 'Indeed they did, but the decree of punishment is justly carried out against the kafirun.'",

    "40:37": "access to the heavens, so that I can look on Musa's God. Truly I think he is a liar.' That is how Pharaoh's evil actions were made attractive to him and he debarred others from the Path. Pharaoh's scheming led to nothing but ruin.",

    "40:49": "Those in the Fire will say to the custodians of Hell, 'Call on your Lord to make the punishment less for us for just one day.'",
    "40:50": "They will ask, 'Did your Messengers not bring you the Clear Signs?' They will answer, 'Yes.' They will say, 'Then you call!' But the calling of the kafirun only goes astray.",

    "40:68": "It is He who gives life and causes to die. When He decides on something, He just says to it, 'Be!' and it is.",
    "40:69": "Do you not see those who argue about Allah's Signs? How have they been turned around?",
    "40:70": "Those who deny the Book and that with which We sent Our Messengers will certainly come to know",

    "40:84": "When they saw Our violent force, they said, 'We have iman in Allah alone and reject what we associated with Him.'",
    "40:85": "But when they saw Our violent force their iman was of no use to them. That is the pattern Allah has always followed with His slaves. Then and there the kafirun were lost.",

    "42:23": "That is the good news which Allah gives to His slaves who have iman and do right actions. Say: 'I do not ask you for any wage for this - except for you to love your near of kin. If anyone does a good action, We will increase the good of it for him. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Thankful.'",
    "42:24": "Or do they ask, 'Has he invented a lie about Allah?' If Allah willed, He could seal up your heart. By His Words Allah wipes out the false and confirms the truth. He knows what the heart contains.",

    "42:26": "He responds to those who have iman and do right actions and gives them increase from His favour. But the kafirun will have a harsh punishment.",
    "42:27": "Were Allah to expand the provision of His slaves, they would act as tyrants on the earth. But He sends down whatever He wills in a measured way. He is aware of and He sees His slaves.",

    "42:32": "Among His Signs are the tall ships sailing like mountains through the sea.",
    "42:33": "If He wills He makes the wind stop blowing and then they lie motionless on its back. There are certainly Signs in that for everyone who is steadfast and thankful.",

    "42:39": "those who, when they are wronged, defend themselves.",
    "42:40": "The repayment of a bad action is one equivalent to it. But if someone pardons and puts things right, his reward is with Allah. Certainly He does not love wrongdoers.",
    "42:41": "But if people do defend themselves when they are wronged, nothing can be held against them for doing that.",
    "42:42": "There are only grounds against those who wrong people and act as tyrants in the earth without any right to do so. Such people will have a painful punishment.",
    "42:43": "But if someone is steadfast and forgives, that is the most resolute course to follow.",
    "42:44": "Whoever Allah misguides has no one to protect them after that. You will see the wrongdoers saying, when they see the punishment, 'Is there no way back?'",
    "42:45": "You will see them as they are exposed to it, abject in their abasement, glancing around them furtively. Those who have iman will say, 'Truly the losers are those who lose themselves and their families on the Day of Rising.' The wrongdoers are in an everlasting punishment.",
    "42:46": "They have no one to protect or help them apart from Allah. There is no way out for anyone Allah",

    "42:52": "Accordingly We have revealed to you a Ruh by Our command. You had no idea of what the Book was, nor faith. Nonetheless We have made it a Light by which We guide those of Our slaves We will. Truly you are guiding to a Straight Path:",
    "42:53": "the Path of Allah to Whom everything in the heavens and everything on the earth belongs. Indeed all",

    "43:6": "How many Prophets We sent to the previous peoples!",
    "43:7": "But no Prophet came to them without their mocking him;",

    "43:22": "No, in fact they say, 'We found our fathers following a religion and we are simply guided in their footsteps.'",

    "46:4": "Say: 'Have you thought about those you call upon apart from Allah? Show me what they have created on the earth. Or do they have a partnership in the heavens? Produce a Book for me before this one or a shred of knowledge if you are telling the truth.'",
    "46:5": "Who could be further astray than those who call on other things besides Allah, which will not respond to them until the Day of Rising and which are unaware of their prayers?",
    "46:6": "When mankind is gathered together, they will be their enemies and will reject their worship.",
    "46:7": "When Our Clear Signs are recited to them, those who reject say to the truth when it comes to them, 'This is downright magic'",
    "46:8": "Or do they say, 'He has invented it'? Say: 'If I have invented it, then you possess no power to help me against Allah in any way. He knows best what you hold forth about. He is witness enough between me and you. He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.'",
    "46:9": "Say: 'I am nothing new among the Messengers. I have no idea what will be done with me or you. I only follow what has been revealed to me. I am only a clear warner.'",
    "46:10": "Say: 'What do you think? If it is from Allah and you reject it, when a witness from the tribe of Israel testifies to its similarity and has iman while you are arrogant . . . ! Allah certainly does not guide wrongdoing people.'",
    "46:11": "Those who are kafir say of those who have iman, 'If there was any good in it, they would not have beaten us to it.' And since they have not been guided by it, they are bound to say, 'This is an antiquated falsehood.'",
    "46:12": "But before it there was the Book of Musa as a model and a mercy. And this is a corroborating Book in the Arabic tongue so that you may warn those who do wrong, and as good news for the good-doers.",
    "46:13": "Those who say, 'Our Lord is Allah,' and then go straight will feel no fear and will know no sorrow.",
    "46:14": "Such people are the Companions of the Garden, remaining in it timelessly, for ever, as repayment for what they did.",
    "46:15": "We have instructed man to be good to his parents. His mother bore him with difficulty and with difficulty gave birth to him; and his bearing and weaning take thirty months. Then when he achieves his full strength and reaches forty, he says, 'My Lord, keep me thankful for the blessing You bestowed on me and on my parents, and keep me acting rightly, pleasing You. And make my descendants righteous. I have made tawba to You and I am truly one of the Muslims.'",
    "46:16": "Those are people whose best deeds will be accepted and whose wrong deeds will be overlooked. They are among the Companions of the Garden, in fulfilment of the true promise made to them.",
    "46:17": "But what of him who says to his parents, 'Fie on you! Do you promise me that I will be resurrected when generations before me have passed away?' They both call on Allah for help: 'Woe to you! Have iman! Allah's promise is true.' But he says, 'This is nothing but the myths of previous peoples.'",
    "46:18": "Those are people of whom the statement about the nations, both of jinn and men, who passed away before them, has also proved true; truly they were the lost.",
    "46:19": "Everyone will be ranked according to what they did. We will pay them in full for their actions and they will not be wronged.",
    "46:20": "On the Day when those who were kafir are exposed to the Fire: 'You dissipated the good things you had in your worldly life and enjoyed yourself in it. So today you are being repaid with the punishment of humiliation for being arrogant in the earth without any right and for being deviators.'",
    "46:21": "Remember the brother of 'Ad when he warned his people by the sand-dunes - and warners passed away before and after him - 'Worship no one but Allah. I fear for you the punishment of a terrible Day.'",
    "46:22": "They said, 'Have you come to us to divert us from our gods? Bring us what you have promised us if you are telling the truth.'",
    "46:23": "He said, 'All knowledge is with Allah. I only transmit to you what I have been sent with. But I see that you are a people who are ignorant.'",
    "46:24": "When they saw it as a storm cloud advancing on their valleys they said, 'This is a storm cloud which will give us rain.' No, rather it is what you desired to hasten - a wind containing painful punishment,",
    "46:25": "destroying everything at its Lord's command! When morning came you could see nothing but their dwellings. That is how We repay the people of the evildoers.",
    "46:26": "We established them far more firmly than We have established you and gave them hearing, sight and hearts. But their hearing, sight and hearts were of no use to them at all when they renounced Allah's Signs and what they mocked at engulfed them.",
    "46:27": "We destroyed the cities round about you and have variegated the Signs so that hopefully they will turn back.",
    "46:28": "Why have those they took as gods besides Allah, to bring them near to Him, not come to their aid? No, in fact they have forsaken them! That was a fiction, something they invented.",
    "46:29": "And We diverted a group of jinn towards you to listen to the Qur'an. When they were in earshot of it they said, 'Be quiet and listen.' When it was over they went back to their people, warning them.",
    "46:30": "They said, 'Our people, we have heard a Book which was sent down after Musa, confirming what came before it, guiding to the truth and to a straight path.",
    "46:31": "Our people, respond to Allah's caller and believe in Him. He will forgive you some of your wrong actions and save you from a painful punishment.",
    "46:32": "Those who do not respond to Allah's caller cannot thwart Allah on earth and have no protectors apart from Him. Such people are clearly misguided.'",
    "46:33": "Do they not see that Allah - He who created the heavens and the earth and was not wearied by creating them - has the power to bring the dead to life? Yes indeed! He has power over all things.",
    "46:34": "On the Day when those who were kafir are exposed to the Fire, they will be asked, 'Is this not the truth?' They will say, 'Yes, by our Lord.' He will say, 'Then taste the punishment for having been kafir.'",
    "46:35": "So be steadfast as the Messengers with firm resolve were also steadfast. And do not seek to hasten it for them. On the Day they see what they were promised, it will be as if they had only tarried for just one hour of a single day. It has been transmitted! Will any be destroyed except for deviant people?",
    "47:1": "As for those who are kafir and bar others from the Way of Allah, Allah will make their actions go astray.",
    "47:2": "But as for those who have iman and do right actions and have iman in what has been sent down to condition.",
    "47:3": "That is because those who are kafir follow falsehood whereas those who have iman follow the truth from their Lord. In that way Allah makes comparisons for mankind.",
    "47:4": "Therefore when you meet those who are kafir strike their necks. Then when you have decimated them, tie their bonds tightly and set them free or ransom them, until the war is finally over. That is how it is to be. If Allah willed, He could avenge Himself on them. But it is so that He can test some of you by means of others. As for those who fight in the Way of Allah, He will not let their actions go astray.",
    "47:5": "He will guide them and better their condition",
    "47:6": "and He will admit them into the Garden which He has made known to them.",
    "47:7": "You who have iman! if you help Allah, He will help you and make your feet firm.",
    "47:8": "But those who are kafir will have utter ruin and He will make their actions go astray.",
    "47:9": "That is because they hate what Allah has sent down, so He has made their actions come to nothing.",
    "47:10": "Have they not travelled about the earth and seen the final fate of those before them? Allah destroyed them utterly. And those who are kafir will suffer the same fate.",
    "47:11": "That is because Allah is the Protector of those who have iman and because those who are kafir have no protector.",
    "47:12": "Allah will admit those who have iman to Gardens with rivers flowing under them. Those who are kafir have their enjoyment, eating as cattle eat, but the Fire will be their final residence.",
    "47:13": "How many cities We have destroyed, greater in strength than your city which has driven you out, and there was no one to help them.",
    "47:14": "Is someone on a clear path from his Lord like those whose bad actions have been made to seem good to them and who follow their own desires?",
    "47:15": "An image of the Garden which is promised to those who have taqwa: in it there are rivers of water which will never spoil and rivers of milk whose taste will never change and rivers of wine, delightful to all who drink it, and rivers of honey of undiluted purity; in it they will have fruit of every kind and forgiveness from their Lord. Is that like those who will be in the Fire timelessly, for ever, with boiling water to drink which lacerates their bowels?",
    "47:16": "Among them are those who listen to you and then, when they leave your presence, say to those who have been given knowledge, 'What was that he just said?' They are those whose hearts Allah has sealed up and who follow their own desires.",
    "47:17": "He increases in guidance those who are already guided and gives them their taqwa.",
    "47:18": "What are they awaiting but for the Hour to come upon them suddenly? Its Signs have already come. What good will their Reminder be to them when it does arrive?",
    "47:19": "Know then that there is no god except Allah and ask forgiveness for your wrongdoing, and for the men and women who have iman. Allah knows both your activity and your repose.",
    "47:20": "Those who have iman say, 'If only a sura could be sent down.' But when a straightforward sura is sent down and fighting is mentioned in it, you see those with sickness in their hearts looking at you with the look of someone about to faint from fear of death. More fitting for them",
    "47:21": "would be obedience and honourable words. Once the matter is resolved upon, being true to Allah would be better for them.",
    "47:22": "Is it not likely that, if you did turn away, you would cause corruption in the earth and sever your ties of kinship?",
    "47:23": "Such are the people Allah has cursed, making them deaf and blinding their eyes.",
    "47:24": "Will they not then ponder the Qur'an or are there locks upon their hearts?",
    "47:25": "Those who have turned back in their tracks after the guidance became clear to them, it was Shaytan who talked them into it and filled them with false hopes.",
    "47:26": "That is because they said to those who hate what Allah has sent down, 'We will obey you in part of the affair.' But Allah knows their secrets.",
    "47:27": "How will it be when the angels take them in death, beating their faces and their backs?",
    "47:28": "That is because they followed what angers Allah and hated what is pleasing to Him. So He made their actions come to nothing.",
    "47:29": "Or did those with sickness in their hearts imagine that Allah would not expose their malevolence?",
    "47:30": "If We wished, We would show them to you and you would know them by their mark and know them by their ambivalent speech. Allah knows your actions.",
    "47:31": "We will test you until We know the true fighters among you and those who are steadfast and test what is reported of you.",
    "47:32": "Those who are kafir and obstruct the Way of Allah, and are entrenched in hostility towards the Messenger after the guidance has become clear to them, do not harm Allah in any way and He makes their actions come to nothing.",
    "47:33": "You who have iman! obey Allah and obey the Messenger. Do not make your actions of no worth.",
    "47:34": "Those who are kafir and obstruct the Way of Allah, and then die kafir, Allah will not forgive them.",
    "47:35": "Do not become faint-hearted and call for peace when you are uppermost and Allah is with you - He would never cheat you of your deeds.",
    "47:36": "The life of this world is merely a game and a diversion. If you have iman and taqwa, He will pay you your wages and not ask you for all your wealth.",
    "47:37": "If He did ask you for it and put you under pressure, you would be tight-fisted and it would bring out your",
    "47:38": "Here you are then: people who are called upon to spend in the Way of Allah and then some of you are tight-fisted! But whoever is tight-fisted is only tight-fisted to himself. Allah is Rich and you are poor. If you turn away, He will replace you with a people other than yourselves and they will not be like you.",
    "48:1": "Truly We have granted you a clear victory,",
    "48:2": "so that Allah may forgive you your earlier errors and any later ones and complete His blessing upon you, and guide you on a Straight Path.",
    "48:3": "and so that Allah may help you with a mighty help.",
    "48:4": "It is He who sent down serenity into the hearts of the muminun thereby increasing their iman with more iman - the legions of the heavens and the earth belong to Allah. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise -",

    "48:10": "Those who pledge you their allegiance pledge allegiance to Allah. Allah's hand is over their hands. He who breaks his pledge only breaks it against himself. But as for him who fulfils the contract he has made with Allah, We will pay him an immense reward.",
    "48:11": "Those Arabs who remained behind will say to you, 'Our wealth and families kept us occupied, so ask forgiveness for us.' They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: 'Who can control Allah for you in any way whether He wants harm for you or wants benefit for you?' Allah is aware of what you do.",
    "48:12": "No, you thought that the Messenger and the muminun were not going to return to their families, and that seemed pleasing to your hearts and you thought evil thoughts and you were a blighted people.",
    "48:13": "Whoever does not have iman in Allah and His Messenger - We have prepared a Blazing Fire for the kafirun.",
    "48:14": "The kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. He forgives those He wills and punishes those He wills. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "48:15": "When you go out to get the booty, those who remained behind will say, 'Allow us to follow you,' desiring to alter Allah's words. Say: 'You may not follow us. That is what Allah said before.' They will say, 'It is only because you envy us.' No indeed! How little they have understood!",
    "48:16": "Say to the Arabs who remained behind: 'You will be called up against a people who possess great force whom you must fight unless they submit. If you obey, Allah will give you an excellent reward. But if you turn your backs as you did before, He will punish you with a painful punishment.'",
    "48:17": "There is no constraint on the blind, nor on the lame, nor on the sick. We will admit all who obey Allah and His Messenger into Gardens with rivers flowing under them. But We will punish with a painful punishment anyone who turns his back.",
    "48:18": "Allah was pleased with the muminun when they pledged allegiance to you under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts, and sent down serenity to them and has rewarded them with an imminent victory,",
    "48:19": "and with much booty which they will take. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.",
    "48:20": "Allah has promised you much booty which you will take, and has hastened this for you and held people's hands back from you, so that it might be a Sign to the muminun, and so that He might guide you to a straight path.",
    "48:21": "And other booty you do not yet have the power to take - Allah has already encompassed it. Allah has power over all things.",
    "48:22": "If those who are kafir should fight you, they would turn their backs and then find no one to protect or help them.",

    "48:24": "It is He who held their hands back from you, and your hands from them in the valley of Makka, after giving you the upper hand over them. Allah sees what you do.",
    "48:25": "They are those who were kafir and debarred you from the Masjid al-Haram and prevented the sacrifice from reaching its proper place, and had it not been for some men and women who are muminun, whom you did not know and might trample underfoot, and so unknowingly incur blame on their account - so that Allah distinguishable, We would have punished them with a painful punishment.",
    "48:26": "Those who are kafir filled their hearts with fanatical rage - the fanatical rage of the Time of Ignorance and Allah sent down serenity to His Messenger and to the muminun, and bound them to the expression of taqwa which they had most right to and were most entitled to. Allah has knowledge of all things.",
    "48:27": "Allah has confirmed His Messenger's vision with truth: 'You will enter the Masjid al-Haram in safety, Allah willing, shaving your heads and cutting your hair without any fear.' He knew what you did not know and ordained, in place of this, an imminent victory.",

    "48:29": "Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are fierce to the kafirun, merciful to one another. You see them bowing and prostrating, seeking Allah's good favour and His pleasure. Their mark is on their faces, the traces of prostration. That is their likeness in the Torah. And their likeness in the Injil is that of a seed which puts up a shoot and makes it strong so that it thickens and grows up straight upon its stalk, filling the sowers with delight - so that by them He may infuriate the kuffar. Allah has promised those of them who have iman and do right actions forgiveness and an immense reward.",

    "49:7": "Know that the Messenger of Allah is among you. If he were to obey you in many things, you would suffer for it. However, Allah has given you love of iman and made it pleasing to your hearts, and has made kufr, deviance and disobedience hateful to you. People such as these are rightly guided.",

    "49:9": "If two parties of the muminun fight, make peace between them. But if one of them attacks the other unjustly, fight the attackers until they revert to Allah's command. If they revert, make peace between them with justice, and be even-handed. Allah loves those who are even-handed.",
    "49:10": "The muminun are brothers, so make peace between your brothers and have taqwa of Allah so that hopefully you will gain mercy.",
    "49:11": "You who have iman! people should not ridicule others who may be better than themselves; nor should any women ridicule other women who may be better than themselves. And do not find fault with one another or insult each other with derogatory nicknames. How evil it is to have a name for evil conduct after coming to iman! Those people who do not turn from it are wrongdoers.",
    "49:12": "You who have iman! avoid most suspicion. Indeed some suspicion is a crime. And do not spy and do not backbite one another. Would any of you like to eat his brother's dead flesh? No, you would hate it. And have taqwa of Allah. Allah is Ever-Returning, Most Merciful.",

Three men cannot confer together secretly without Him being the fourth of them, or five without Him being the sixth of them, or fewer than that or more without Him being with them wherever they are. Then He will inform them on the Day of Rising of what they did. Allah has knowledge of all things.",

Hell will be enough for them! They will roast in it. What an evil destination!",
    "58:9": "You who have iman! when you confer together secretly, do not do so in wrongdoing and enmity and disobedience to the Messenger; rather confer together in goodness and taqwa of Allah. Have taqwa of Allah - Him to Whom you will be gathered.",
    "58:10": "Conferring in secret is from Shaytan, to cause grief to those who have iman; but it cannot harm them at all, unless by Allah's permission. So let the muminun put their trust in Allah.",

    "58:13": "Are you afraid to give gifts of sadaqa before your private consultation? If you do not and Allah turns to you, at least establish salat and pay zakat, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah is aware of what you do.",
    "58:14": "Do you not see those who have turned to people with whom Allah is angry? They belong neither to you nor to them. And they swear to falsehood and do so knowingly.",
    "58:15": "Allah has prepared a terrible punishment for them. How evil is what they have been doing!",
    "58:16": "They made their oaths into a cloak and barred the Way of Allah, so they will have a humiliating punishment.",
    "58:17": "Neither their wealth nor their children will help them at all against Allah. Such people are the Companions of the Fire, remaining in it timelessly, for ever.",

Allah has inscribed iman upon such people's hearts and will reinforce them with a Ruh from Him and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever.

Then Allah came upon them from where they least expected it and cast terror into their hearts. Their houses were pulled down by their own hands and by the hands of the muminun. People of insight, take note!",
    "59:3": "If Allah had not prescribed banishment for them, He would have punished them in the dunya. But in the akhira they will have the punishment of the Fire.",

    "59:9": "Those who were already settled in the abode, and in iman, before they came, love those who have made hijra to them and do not find in their hearts any need for what they have been given and prefer them to themselves even if they themselves are needy.

And if you are fought against we will help you'? Allah bears witness that they are truly liars.",
    "59:12": "If they are driven out they will not leave with them. If they are fought against they will not help them. And if they did help them they would turn their backs, and then they would not be helped.",
    "59:13": "You are a greater cause of terror in their breasts than Allah! That is because they are people who do not understand.",
    "59:14": "They will not fight against you all together as a group except in fortified towns or behind high walls. Their hostility towards each other is intense. They are full of bravado in each other's company. You consider them united but their hearts are scattered wide. That is because they are people who do not use their intellect.",
    "59:15": "They are the same as those a short time before them who tasted the evil consequences of what they did. They will have a painful punishment.",
    "59:16": "They are like Shaytan when he says to a human being, 'Be kafir,' and then when he becomes kafir, says, 'I wash my hands of you. Truly I fear Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.'",
    "59:17": "The final fate of both of them is that they will be timelessly, for ever in the Fire. That is the repayment of the wrongdoers.",

If you go out to do jihad in My Way and seeking My pleasure, keeping secret the love you have for them, I know best what you conceal and what you make known. Any of you who do that have strayed from the right way.",

Between us and you there will be enmity and hatred for ever unless and until you have iman in Allah alone.' Except for Ibrahim's words to his father: 'I will ask forgiveness for you but I have no power to help you in any way against Allah.' 'Our Lord, we have put our trust in You. and have made tawba to You. You are our final destination.",

    "60:10": "You who have iman! when women who have iman come to you as muhajirun, submit them to a test. Allah has best knowledge of their iman. If you know they are muminun. do not return them to the kuffar. They are not halal for the kuffar nor are the kuffar halal for them. Give the kuffar whatever dowry they paid. And there is nothing wrong in your marrying them provided you pay them their due. Do not hold to any marriage ties with women who are kafir. Ask for what you paid and let them ask for what they paid. That is Allah's judgement. Allah will judge between them. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "60:11": "If any of your wives rejoin the kuffar, you should have compensation. So repay to those whose wives have gone the dowry they paid out. Have taqwa of Allah - Him in Whom you have iman.",
    "60:12": "O Prophet! When women who have iman come to you pledging allegiance to you on the grounds that they will not associate anything with Allah or steal or fornicate or kill their children or give a false ascription of paternity - making up lies about their bodies - or disobey you in respect of anything right, then accept their pledge and ask forgiveness for them. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",

    "61:5": "Remember when Musa said to his people, 'My people, why do you mistreat me when you know that I am the Messenger of Allah to you?' So when they deviated, Allah made their hearts deviate. Allah does not guide people who are deviators.",
    "61:6": "And when 'Isa son of Maryam said, 'Tribe of Israel, I am the Messenger of Allah to you, confirming the Torah which came before me and giving you the good news of a Messenger after me whose name is Ahmad.' When he brought them the Clear Signs, they said, 'This is downright magic'",

    "63:2": "They have made their oaths into a cloak and barred the Way of Allah. What they have done is truly evil.",
    "63:3": "That is because they have had iman and then returned to kufr. So their hearts have been sealed up and they cannot understand.",
    "63:4": "When you see them, their outward form appeals to you, and if they speak you listen to what they say. But they are like propped-up planks of wood. They imagine every cry to be against them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. Allah fight them! How they are perverted!",

    "64:6": "That is because their Messengers brought them the Clear Signs but they said, 'Are human beings going to guide us?' So they were kafir and turned away. But Allah is completely independent of them. Allah is Rich Beyond Need, Praiseworthy.",
    "64:7": "Those who are kafir claim that they will never be raised again. Say: 'Oh yes, by my Lord, you certainly will be raised again! And then you will be informed about what you did. That is easy for Allah.'",

As for those who have iman in Allah and act rightly, We will erase their bad actions from them and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever and ever. That is the Great Victory!",
    "64:10": "But as for those who are kafir and deny Our Signs they are the Companions of the Fire, remaining in it timelessly, for ever. What an evil destination!",
    "64:11": "No misfortune occurs except by Allah's permission. Whoever has iman in Allah - He will guide his heart. Allah has knowledge of all things.",

Do not evict them from their homes, nor should they leave, unless they commit an outright indecency. Those are Allah's limits, and anyone who oversteps Allah's limits has wronged himself. You never know, it may well be that after that Allah will cause a new situation to develop.",
    "65:2": "Then when they have reached the end of their 'idda either retain them with correctness and courtesy or part from them with correctness and courtesy. Call two upright men from among yourselves as witnesses and they should carry out the witnessing for Allah. This is admonishment for all who have iman in Allah and the Last Day. Whoever has taqwa of Allah - He will give him a way out",
    "65:3": "and provide for him from where he does not expect. Whoever puts his trust in Allah - He will be enough for him. Allah always achieves His aim. Allah has appointed a measure for all things.",
    "65:4": "In the case of those of your wives who are past the age of menstruation, if you have any doubt, their 'idda should be three months, and that also applies to those who have not yet menstruated. The time for women who are pregnant is when they give birth. Whoever has taqwa of Allah - He will make matters easy for him.",
    "65:5": "That is Allah's command which He has sent down to you. Whoever has taqwa of Allah - He will erase his bad actions from him and greatly increase his reward.",

If they are suckling for you, give them their wages and consult together with correctness and courtesy. But if you make things difficult for one another, another woman should do the suckling for you.",

Whoever has iman in Allah and acts rightly, We will admit him into Gardens with rivers flowing under them remaining in them timelessly, for ever and ever. Allah has provided for him excellently!",
    "65:12": "It is Allah who created the seven heavens and of the earth the same number, the Command descending down through all of them, so that you might know that Allah has power over all things and that Allah encompasses all things in His knowledge.",
    "66:1": "O Prophet! Why do you make haram what Allah has made halal for you, seeking to please your wives? Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",

It may be that your Lord will erase your bad actions from you and admit you into Gardens with rivers flowing under them on the Day when Allah will not disgrace the ProDhet and those who had iman alona with him. Their liaht will stream out ahead of them and on their riaht. They will say, 'Our Lord, perfect our light for us and forgive us! You have power over all things.'",
    "66:9": "O Prophet! do jihad against the kafirun and hypocrites and be harsh with them. Their refuge is Hell. What an evil destination!",
    "66:10": "Allah has made an example for those who are kafir: the wife of Nuh and the wife of Lut. They were Allah. They were told, 'Enter the Fire along with all who enter it.'",
    "66:11": "Allah has made an example for those who have iman: the wife of Pharaoh when she said, 'My Lord, build a house in the Garden for me in Your presence and rescue me from Pharaoh and his deeds and rescue me from this wrongdoing people.'",

    "67:17": "Or do you feel secure against Him Who is in heaven releasing against you a sudden squall of stones, so that you will know how true My warning was?",
    "67:18": "Those before them also denied but then how great was My denial!",
    "67:19": "Have they not looked at the birds above them, with wings outspread and folded back? Nothing holds them up but the All-Merciful. He sees all things.",

Sulayman did not become kafir, but the shaytans did, teaching people sorcery and what had been sent down to Harut and Marut, the two angels in Babylon, who taught no one without first saying to him, 'We are merely a trial and temptation, so do not become kafir.' People learned from them how to separate a man and his wife but they cannot harm anyone by it, except with Allah's permission. They have learned what will harm them and will not benefit them. They know that any who deal in it will have no share in Next World. What an evil thing they have sold themselves for if they only knew!",

Allah is not unaware of what they do.",

If you followed their whims and desires, after the knowledge that has come to you, you would then be one of the wrongdoers.",
    "2:187": "On the night of the fast it is lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives. They are clothing for you and you for them. Allah knows that you have been betraying yourselves and He has turned towards you and excused you. Now you may have sexual intercourse with them and seek what Allah has written for you. Eat and drink until you can clearly discern the white thread from the black thread of the dawn, then fulfil the fast until the night appears. But do not have sexual intercourse with them while you are in retreat in the people so that hopefully they will have taqwa.",

    "2:189": "They will ask you about the crescent moons. Say, 'They are set times for mankind and for the hajj.' It is not devoutness for you to enter houses by the back.

    "2:257": "Allah is the Protector of those who have iman. He brings them out of the darkness into the light. But those who are kafir have false gods as protectors. They take them from the light into the darkness. Those are the Companions of the Fire remaining in it timelessly, for ever.",
    "2:258": "What about the one who argued with Ibrahim about his Lord, on the basis that Allah had given him sovereignty? Ibrahim said, 'My Lord is He who gives life and causes to die.' He said, 'I too give life and cause to die.' Ibrahim said, 'Allah makes the sun come from the East. Make it come from the West.' And the one who was a kafir was dumbfounded. Allah does not guide wrongdoing people.",
    "2:259": "Or the one who passed by a town which had fallen into ruin? He asked, 'How can Allah restore this to life when it has died?' Allah caused him to die a hundred years then brought him back to life. Then He asked, 'How long have you been here?' He replied, 'I have been here a day or part of a day.' He said, 'Not so! You have been here a hundred years. Look at your food and drink - it has not gone bad - and look at your donkey so We can make you a Sign for all mankind. Look at the bones - how We raise them up and clothe them in flesh.' When it had become clear to him, he said, 'Now I know that Allah has power over all things.'",
    "2:282": "You who have iman! when you take on a debt for a specified period, write it down. A writer should write it down between you justly. No writer should refuse to write; as Allah has taught him, so he should write. The one incurring the debt should dictate and should have taqwa of Allah his Lord and not reduce it in any way. If the person incurring the debt is incompetent or weak or unable to dictate, then his guardian should dictate for him justly. Two men among you should act as witnesses. But if there are not two men, then a man and two women with whom you are satisfied as witnesses; then if one of them forgets, the other can remind her. Witnesses should not refuse when they are called upon. Do not think it too trivial to write down, whether small or large, with the date that it falls due. Doing that is more just in Allah's sight and more helpful when bearing witness and more likely to eliminate any doubt - unless it is an immediate transaction hand to hand, taken and given without delay. There is nothing wrong in your not writing that down. Call witnesses when you trade. Neither writer nor witness should be put under pressure. If you do that, it is deviancy on your part. Have taqwa of Allah and Allah will give you knowledge. Allah has knowledge of all things.",
    "4:12": "You receive half of what your wives leave if they are childless. If they have children you receive a quarter of what they leave after any bequest they make or any debts. They receive a quarter of what you leave if you are childless. If you have children they receive an eighth of what you leave after any bequest you make or any debts. If a man or woman has no direct heirs, but has a brother or sister, each of them receives a sixth. If there are more than that they share in a third after any bequest you make or any debts, making sure that no one's rights are prejudiced. This is an instruction from Allah. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Forbearing.",
    "4:13": "These are Allah's limits. As for those who obey Allah and His Messenger, We will admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, for ever. That is the Great Victory.",
    "4:14": "As for him who disobeys Allah and His Messenger and oversteps His limits, We will admit him into a Fire, to remain in it timelessly, for ever. He will have a humiliating punishment.",
    "4:92": "A mumin should never kill another mumin unless it is by mistake. Anyone who kills a mumin by mistake should free a mumin slave and pay blood-money to his family unless they forgo it as a sadaqa. If he is from a people who are your enemies and is a mumin, you should free a mumin slave. If he is from a people you have a treaty with, blood money should be paid to his family and you should free a mumin slave. Anyone who cannot find the means should fast two consecutive months. This is a concession from Allah. Allah is All- Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "4:93": "As for anyone who kills a mumin deliberately, his repayment is Hell, remaining in it for ever. Allah is angry with him and has cursed him, and has prepared for him a terrible punishment.",
    "4:94": "You who have iman! when you go out to fight in the Way of Allah verify things carefully. Do not say, 'You are not a mumin', to someone who greets you as a Muslim, simply out of desire for the goods of this world. With Allah there is booty in abundance. That is the way you were before but Allah has been kind to you. So verify things carefully. Allah is aware of what you do.",
    "4:102": "When you are with them and leading them in salat, a group of them should stand with you, keeping hold of their weapons. When they prostrate, the others should guard your backs. Then the other group who have not yet prayed should come and pray with you. They too should be careful and keep hold of their weapons. Those who are kafir would like you to be negligent of your arms and equipment so that they can swoop down on you once and for all. There is nothing wrong, if you are bothered by rain or you are ill, in laying your weapons down; but take every precaution. Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for the kafirun.",
    "4:103": "When you have finished salat remember Allah standing, sitting and lying on your sides. When you are safe again do salat in the normal way. The salat is prescribed for the muminun at specific times.",
    "4:104": "Do not relax in pursuit of the enemy. If you feel pain, they too are feeling it just as you are, but you hope for something from Allah which they cannot hope for. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "4:105": "We have sent down the Book to you with the truth so that you can judge between people according to what Allah has shown to you. But do not be an advocate for the treacherous.",
    "5:3": "Haram for you are carrion, blood and pork, and what has been consecrated to other than Allah, and animals which have been strangled, and animals which have been killed by a blow, and animals which have fallen to their death, and animals which have been gored, and animals which wild beasts have eaten - except those you are able to slaughter properly - and animals which have been sacrificed on altars, and deciding things by means of divining arrows - that is deviance. Today the kuffar have despaired of overcoming your deen. So do not be afraid of them but be afraid of Me. Today I have perfected your deen for you and completed My blessing upon you and I am pleased with Islam as a deen for you. But if anyone is forced by hunger, not intending any wrongdoing, Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "5:4": "They will ask you what is halal for them. Say: 'All good things are halal for you, and also what is caught for you by hunting animals which you have trained as Allah has taught you. Eat what they catch for you,",
    "5:5": "Today all good things have been made halal for you. And the food of those given the Book is also halal for you and your food is halal for them. So are free women from among the muminun and free women of those given the Book before you, once you have given them their dowries in marriage, not in fornication or taking them as lovers. But as for anyone who rejects iman, his actions will come to nothing and in the Next World he will be among the losers.",
    "5:42": "They are people who listen to lies and consume ill-gotten gains. If they come to you, you can either judge between them or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they cannot harm you in any way. But if you do judge, judge between them justly. Allah loves the just.",
    "5:43": "How can they make you their judge when they have the Torah with them which contains the judgement of Allah? Then even after that they turn their backs! Such people are certainly not muminun.",
    "5:44": "We sent down the Torah containing guidance and light, and the Prophets who had submitted themselves gave judgement by it for the Jews - as did their scholars and their rabbis - by what they had been allowed to preserve of Allah's Book to which they were witnesses. Do not be afraid of people, be afraid of Me. And do not sell My Signs for a paltry price. Those who do not judge by what Allah has sent down, such people are kafirun.",
    "5:45": "We prescribed for them in it: a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and retaliation for wounds. But if anyone forgoes that as a sadaqa, it will act as expiation for him. Those who do not judge by what Allah has sent down, such people are wrongdoers.",
    "9:37": "Deferring a sacred month is an increase in kufr by which the kuffar lead many people astray. One year they make it profane and another sacred to tally with the number Allah has made sacred. In that way they profane what Allah has made sacred. Their bad actions are made to seem good to them. Allah does not guide kafir people.",
    "9:38": "You who have iman! what is the matter with you that when you are told, 'Go out and fight in the way of Allah,' you sink down heavily to the earth? Are you happier with this world than the Next World? Yet the enjoyment of this world is very small compared to that of the Next World.",
    "9:39": "If you do not go out to fight, He will punish you with a painful punishment and substitute another people in your place. You will not harm Him in any way. Allah has power over all things.",
    "9:40": "If you do not help him, Allah did help him when the kuffar drove him out and there were two of them in the Cave.* He said to his companion, 'Do not be despondent, Allah is with us.' Then Allah sent down His serenity upon him and reinforced him with troops you could not see. He made the word of the kuffar undermost. It is the word of Allah which is uppermost. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise."
