                "Rabbi Hizkiyah opened, “It is written, as a rose among thorns.” That a rose is the Assembly of Israel. Because there is a rose and there is a rose, just as a rose among thorns is tinged with red and white, the Assembly of Israel consists of judgment and mercy. Just as a rose has thirteen petals, the Assembly of Israel is surrounded on all sides by the thirteen attributes of mercy. However, Elohim, that is here, thought to bring out the thirteen words that surround the Assembly of Israel and guard it.",
                "After this, in order to bring out the five rigid leaves that surround the rose, it is mentioned another time in the passage. These five mean salvation. These are 5 gates. And this secret is written about, “I will raise the cup of salvation.” This is the ‘cup of benediction.’ The cup of benediction must rest on five fingers, and no more, just as the rose rests on five rigid leaves that represent the five fingers. This rose is the cup of benediction. From the second to the third mention of the name Elohim, there are five words. From this point the Light was created and concealed and enclosed within that covenant that entered the rose and fructified it. This is referred to as a tree bearing fruit whose seed is within it and this seed really exists in the letter of the covenant. And just as the covenant is sown by forty-two conceptions from that same seed, so is the holy name of the creation sown.",
                "In the beginning, Rabbi Shimon opened, the flower buds appeared on the earth. “The flower buds” refer to the act of creation. They appeared on the earth when, on the third day, as it is said, “And the earth shall pullulate.” That was when they appeared on the earth. The time of singing has come, and this is the fourth day, when there was a reduction from the Light of Hassadim. The voice of the turtle dove refers to the fifth day, where it is written, “Let the waters swarm,” so as to produce offspring. “It is heard” refers to the sixth day, where it is written, “Let us stand and create man,” and there it is said, “We will do and we will hear.”  "

            [
                "“In our land” refers to the day of Shabbat, which represents the Land of Life.",
                "Another meaning is that these flower buds are the Patriarchs who entered the thoughts of the future world, and there they are concealed. They emerged from there in concealment, and concealed themselves in the true prophets. Yosef was born and they concealed themselves in him. When Yosef entered the Holy Land and founded them there, they appeared in the land and were revealed there. When are they seen? When a rainbow is seen in the world. It is when the rainbow is seen that they are revealed. As the time of pruning has come. The time has come to eradicate the wicked from the world. Why were the wicked saved? Because the flower buds can be seen in the earth. And if they could not be seen, they would not have remained in the world, and the world would not be able to exist.",
                "Who animates the world and causes the Fathers to appear? It is the voice of the children, who study the Torah, meaning that these children of the world save the world. In deference to them, “We will make you pendants of gold.” Those are the children, children of the world, as is it said, “You shall make two Cherubs of gold.”",
                "In the beginning, Rabbi Elazar opened, “Raise your eyes above and see who has created this.” Raise your eyes. To what place? To the place where all eyes depend on Him. And who is He? He is one who opens eyes. And you will know this. It is the concealed Atik, wherein lies the question, who has created this. And who is He? M\"I = who. He is called from the edge of Divine Heaven, where everything belongs to Him. As there is a question, He is along a concealed path, and does not reveal Himself. He is called M\"I, as there is no question. Above, this edge of Heaven is called M\"I.",
                "And there is another below, called M\"A. What is between this and that? The first one, called M\"I, is concealed. There is a question in him, because man asks, searches and looks, and beholds from degree to degree until the end of all the degrees. And after he arrives there, he is asked: M\"A?. What have you learned? What have you seen? What have you investigated, since everything is still concealed, just as it was before.",
                " It is written of this secret, “Who can I point out to you? Who can I compare you to?” After all, the Temple was destroyed, and a voice came forth and said, “What can I point out to you, and what can I compare you to?” The word MA = what, testimony, each day and the day of testimony to you from the days of past, as it is written: “I call to witness Heaven and earth,” which is like unto you. According to the same type, “I adorned you with holy ornaments,” made you ruler over the world, as it is written: “Is this the city that was called the quintessence of beauty?” and so forth. I have called you, “Jerusalem, a city built by me.”",
                "What (M”A) can I match with you? Just as you sit, so too does He (as it were) sit above. Just as now the sanctified people cannot enter into you in their sanctified service, so too I promise you that I will not enter above until your legions enter you below. And this is your comfort. For in this way, I am matched with you in all. And now that you are here, “your ruin is vast as the sea.” And if you say that there is no existence or remedy for you. “Who (M”I) can heal you?” Without a doubt, that mysterious supernal degree in which everything exists will heal you and stand you up.",
                "M\"I is the upper edge of Heaven, M\"A is the lower edge of Heaven. This was inherited by Yaakov, that he shines from edge to edge, from the first edge, which is M\"I, until the last edge, which is M\"A, for he stands in the middle. Therefore, who has created this?",
                "Rabbi Shimon said, “Elazar, my son, stop talking and reveal to us the supernal secret, which the people of the world know nothing of.” Rabbi Elazar was silent. Rabbi Shimon wept and said, “One minute.” Rabbi Shimon said, “Elazar, what is ELEH (these)? If you say the stars and the signs of the zodiac, have they not always been seen? However, MA (what) were created, as it is said, by the word of the Creator were the Heavens made. If it is about concealed things, then it is not written ELEH, because they are revealed....",
                "But this secret was never revealed, until one day when I was at the seashore, Eliyahu came and told me: “Rabbi, do you know what this is, WHO HAS CREATED THIS?” I told him: “These are the Heavens and their hosts, the works of the Creator, that man can look at them and bless them, as is written, ‘When I behold Your Heavens, the work of Your "

                "hands, our Master (Adonai), how glorious Your name is throughout all the earth’!\"",
                "He told me: “Rabbi, there was one thing concealed before the Creator, which He revealed to the Supernal Assembly, and it is this. When the concealed of all the concealed desired to reveal Himself, He first made one single point, and this point ascended and became a Thought. With it, He drew all the forms and with it engraved all the images.",
                "He engraved inside a concealed, sacred candle an image of a concealed image of the holy of holies. A profound structure emerged from the depth of that thought, and it is called M\"I – who, which is the inception of the structure both standing and not standing, which is hidden deep inside the name. It is not called, but only M\"I – who. He desired to reveal Himself and to be called this name, so He clothed Himself in a precious, radiant garment and created ELEH, and ELEH ascended in name. These letters combined with these, and the name Elohim was completed. And until He created ELEH – this, Elohim did not ascend to form the name Elohim. And these sinned in worshipping the golden calf. Of this secret it is said, ELEH is your Lord, Israel.",
                "Just as the letters MI joined the letters ELEH, so does this name remain forever united, and on this secret stands the world. Eliyahu then flew away, and I could not see him. It is from him that I knew this, which stands on the secret, and its explanation. Rabbi Elazar has come, and all the disciples, too, and they bowed down before him, wept and said, if we had (not) come into this world but only to hear this secret, it would have been enough.",
                "Rabbi Shimon said: “Onto these Heavens and their hosts were created in M\"A, as it is said, ‘When I behold the Heavens, the works of Your hands,’ and it is said, ‘ M\"A, how glorious Your name is throughout all the earth, which You set Above the Heavens, it ascends in name.’ That is why it created Light for Light, clothed this into this, and elevated in the Supernal Name, this the Creator created in the beginning. This is the Supernal Creator, for M\"A is not such and was not created.",
                "But as the letters ELEH descend from Above, from Bina down to Malchut, for the mother temporarily lends her clothes to her daughter and adorns her with her own adornments, the name Elohim descends from Bina to Malchut. When does she adorn her with her own adornments? When she sees the male essence before her. It is then written of her, “Three times in the year shall all your males appear before the Lord Creator”. For Malchut is then called by the male name “Master.” As it is written: “Behold the Ark of the Union, the Master of all the earth”. The Torah is the Union and the Ark is Malchut, called by the male name “Master.” For she received the Kelim called “clothes,” and the Light called “adornments” from her mother, Bina. The letter Hey then leaves M\"A and the letter Yod enters in its stead, and just like Bina, Malchut assumes the name MI. And then she adorns herself with male clothes, with the clothes of Bina, to accept all the husbands of Israel.",
                "Israel receives the last letters from Above, from Bina down to that place, i.e., to Malchut, who is now called MI, just like the name Bina. I pronounce the letters ELEH and my whole soul weeps so as to receive these letters ELEH from Bina into the house of Elohim, which is Malchut. So that Malchut would be called Elohim, just as Bina is called Elohim. How can I receive them? “With joyous songs of praise sung in the voice of the Torah, and festive throngs”",
                "Rabbi Elazar said, “My silence has erected the Temple Above, which is Bina, and the Temple below, which is Malchut. Of course, as people say, ‘A word is worth a gold coin’, but silence is worth two.” So the words “a word is worth a gold coin” mean that I spoke and came to regret it. Silence, my silence, is worth twice as much, for the two worlds, Bina and Malchut, were created by this silence. For had I not kept silent, I would not have attained the unity of both worlds.”",
                "Rabbi Shimon said, “From here on the perfection of the written is said to bring forth their host by number.” For these are two degrees, and each must be recorded, that is, noted: one is called MA and the other MI. MI is the Upper One, and MA is the lower one. The Upper Degree registers, speaks, and brings forth their hosts by number, where the letter Hey alludes to the one that is known and unequaled, namely M\"I. This is similar to the phrase, “HaMotzi Lechem” – He who brings forth bread from the earth, where the letter Hey refers to the knowledge of the known, lower degree, namely M\"A. And together they are one degree, Malchut. However, the Upper One is M\"I de Malchut and the lower one is M\"A de Malchut, the one that brings forth their host by number, for the number 600,000 refers to the number of stars that stand together, and they bring forth innumerable hosts.",
                "All of these 600,000 and all their innumerable hosts, He calls the names. What does this mean: “calls the names?” If you say that He calls them by their names, it is not so, for then it would have said, “calls by name.” However, when this degree does not ascend in the name Elohim, but is called M\"I, it does not beget and does not reveal those that are concealed within it. And although they were all concealed within it, meaning that even though the letters ELEH have already ascended, the “precious garment” of Ohr Hassadim is still concealed. And while it is concealed, it is not called by the name Elohim. For He created the letters ELEH and they ascended in His name – clothed themselves in “precious garments” of Ohr Hassadim, as a result of which ELEH combine with M\"I, and are called Elo-im. Then, by the power of this name, He brought them forth in perfection, defined as “CALLS THEIR NAMES,” which means that He called by name and brought forth every type and species to exist in perfection. Hence, it is said: “HE BROUGHT FORTH THEIR HOST BY NUMBER – called them all by name, that is, by the name Elohim.",
                "He asks: “What is the meaning of “by the greatness of His might and wealth?” This is the"

                "head of the degree, where all desires ascend and remain concealed. The strong one that ascended in the name Elokim, as it is said: “This is the secret of the Upper World, called MI.” No man is missing of the 600,000 that He created by the power of this name. And because no one is missing from these 600,000, it follows that wherever the sons of Israel perished and were punished for their transgressions, we subsequently find that not one from the 600,000 had disappeared, so that everything would remain the same Above and below. And just as no one had disappeared from the 600,000 Above, no one has disappeared from this number below.",
                "Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba said: “In the first four words of the Torah, IN THE BEGINNING THE CREATOR CREATED Et – Beresheet Barah Elohim Et, the first two words begin with the letter Bet, and the following two begin with Aleph\". It is said that, “When the Creator thought to create the world, all of the letters were still concealed, and even 2,000 years before the creation of the world, the Creator gazed into the letters and played with them.",
                "When the Creator thought to create the world, all the letters of the alphabet came to Him in reverse order from last to first. The letter Tav entered first and said, “Master of the world! It is good, and also seemly of You, to create the world with me, with my properties. For I am the seal on Your ring, called EmeT, that ends with the letter Tav. And that is why You are called truth, and why it would befit the King to begin the universe with the letter Tav, and to create the world by her, by her properties. The Creator answered: “You are beautiful and sincere, but do not merit the world that I conceived to be created by your properties, since you are destined to be marked on the foreheads of the truly faithful who fulfill all of Torah from Aleph to Tav, and perished because of you”",
                "24. The letter Shin appeared before the Creator and said: “Maker of the world, it befits the world to be created with me, for Your own name Shaddai begins with me.” The Creator replied: “You are fine, handsome, and truthful, but since the letters of the word Sheker took you to be with them, I cannot create the world with your properties, for SheKeR exists only because the letters Kuf and Reish took you.” From the aforesaid, it follows that whoever wishes to tell a lie will succeed if he first tells the truth as a base on which the lie will then grow and start to act. And this is because the letter Shin is a letter of truth, in which the Patriarchs had been united, for the three lines in the writing of the letter Shin signify the three Patriarchs, who designate the Sefirot-properties Hesed- Gevura- Tifferet.",
                "Subsequently, the letter Tzadik appeared before the Creator and said: “Master of the world, You should create the world with me, for Tzadikim are marked by me. You, who is called a Tzadik, are also recorded within me, for You are righteous and You love righteousness. Therefore, my properties are suitable to create the world by.” The Creator answered: “Tzadik, you are truly righteous, but you must remain concealed and not be revealed to the extent required were the world to be created by you, so as to not give the world an excuse.” The concealment of the letter Tzadik is necessary, for first came the letter Nun, which was then joined by the letter Yod from the Creator’s Holy Name HaVaYaH who stood above it as a mark of the bond between the Creator and His creations, mounted the letter Nun and joined it on its right hand side, thereby creating the letter Tzadik.",
                "The letter Peh entered and said: “Master of the world, it would be good to create the world with me, for the future liberation of the world is inscribed in me, as the word Pedut begins with me. That is, liberation is deliverance from all suffering. And it is therefore fitting to create the world with me. The Creator answered her: “Though you are fine, the word begins with you and is secretly denoted by you, like a serpent that strikes and hides its head in its body. So a sinner bows his head, hiding from others’ eyes, but stretches out his hands to sin. So is the shape of the letter Peh, whose head is hidden inside it.” And the Creator also said to the letter Ayin that it would be unfitting to create the world with its properties, for within it is the property of Avon. And though Ayin tried to object, saying that its properties are contained in the word Anavah, the Creator refused it nonetheless.",

If you move from your place, contained in the word Somech, those who fall will lose your support, for they rely on you.” Having heard this, the letter Samech departed.",
                "The letter Nun entered and said to the Creator: “It would be good for You to create the world with me, for Norah Tehilot is written with me, as well as ‘Praising of the righteous.’” The Creator replied: “Return to your place, for you are the reason that the letter Samech returned to its place. And rely on it for support. For the letter Nun exists in the word Nefilah, which must be corrected by the letter Samech. This is the reason why it needed to return to its place – so as to strengthen the lower ones.” The letter Nun left Him at once....",
                "The letter Mem entered and said: “Master of the world, it would be good for You to create the world by me, for Melech is called by me.” The Creator replied: “That is so, but I shall not create the world by you, for the world needs a King. Return to your place. Also, I shall not create the world with the letters Lamed and Chaf that form the word MeLeCH, as the world cannot exist without a King.”",
                "At this time the letter Chaf descended from the Kisseh – the Creator’s throne, and stood before the Creator. It trembled and said to Him: “Creator of the world, with my properties I merit to become the basis of the world, for I am Kavod – Your Glory.” When the letter Chaf descended from the Creator’s throne, all the worlds trembled, and the throne itself, verging on collapse. The Creator then answered: “Chaf, what are you doing here? I will not create the world by you. Return to your place, for you exist in the word Kelayah and in the word Kalah.”",

Therefore, it cannot take any part in the world that I wish to create, and will only be revealed in the world to come. And since your goodness is concealed within you, the gates of the palace will sink into the ground, for the letter Chet is opposite from you, and when you join together, the word CHeT will be formed.

And, indeed, the King of the universe cannot take back his gift and give it to another!” The Creator replied: “Although I will create the world by the letter Bet, it is you who will stand at the head of all the letters, and there shall be no unity in Me, but through you alone; all accounts and deeds of this world shall always begin with you, and all of unity shall be in you alone.”"

When it locks those gates, encloses them within itself, it is written IN THE BEGINNING: a revealed word, though it is usually concealed. BARAH is a concealed word everywhere, implying that the key unlocks it and locks it up.",

And the greatest of all, Rabbi Shimon, the Light of the entire world, of all the worlds, who illuminates and governs over the descending Light, upon which our world exists, is also consumed by you, and yet you govern the world?” But then he collected himself at once and said: “Do not be proud, dust, for the pillars of the world will not be betrayed to you, and Rabbi Shimon will not be consumed by you!”",

Meanwhile, he saw many great celestial wings. Rabbi Shimon and his son Rabbi Elazar mounted on them and were borne aloft to the heavenly Yeshivah. And all those wings were waiting for them.

Wake them!...",

Who among you hopes and waits each day for the Light that shines when the Lord distances, when His greatness grows and He is called the King of all kings of the world?

Some were ascending while others were descending. And high above them all, he saw the owner of the wings, (the angel Metatron), approach. He (Metatron) swears that he heard from behind the curtain how the King attends the Gazelle every day and remembers how She lies in the dust.

By the power of these tears, the governor who rules the sea, (called Rahav), is sustained and stays alive. And he sanctifies the name of the Holy King by taking it upon himself to swallow all the waters of the days of Creation.

The Mashiach, the King-Redeemer is coming to the assembly of Rabbi Shimon,” for all the righteous gathered there are the heads of groups and assemblies, whereas all of the assembly members ascend from this assembly to the Assembly of Heaven. And the Mashiach visits all these assemblies and seals the Torah that stems from the mouths of the righteous.

At that moment, he saw Rabbi Chiya in Rabbi Shimon’s adornments. He asked, “Who gave man in this world the adornments, garment of the other world?”. Rabbi Shimon answered, “This is Rabbi Chiya, the shining light of the Torah!” He said to him, “Gather him and his sons, (meaning, they will pass away) and they shall join your Assembly.” Rabbi Shimon said, “Let him be given time\" and he was granted time. He (the Messiah) left there trembling all over, his eyes brimming with tears. Rabbi Chiya was deeply shaken and wept. Then he said, how happy are the righteous with their portion in the World to Come, and how happy is the son of Yochai, who has this distinction. He is described by the verse, \"I may cause those who love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures\" (Proverbs 8:21).",

How important it is for a person to study laboriously the Torah day and night. Very important, because the Holy One, blessed be He, listens attentively to the voices of those who occupy themselves with the study of the Torah. And every word that receives a new interpretation by a person who delves into the study of the Torah creates a new Firmament.",

And the Holy One, blessed be He, receives this matter and kisses it. He also adorns it with seventy graven and inscribed crowns. And this new word of wisdom that is revealed is then set upon the head of the Righteous who lives forever. Then it flies off and floats through 70,000 worlds until it reaches Atik Yomin, (the Sefirah of Keter). And all the words of Atik Yomin are words of wisdom comprising sublime and hidden mysteries.",
                "And when this hidden wisdom, which is renewed here in this world, ascends, she joins Atik, ascends and descends, enters 18 worlds, where no eye has seen the Creator besides you. They emerge from there and appear before Atik, complete and perfect. Meanwhile, Atik tests her and finds her most desirable above all else. He then takes her and adorns her with 370,000 adornments. And she, the renewed Torah, ascends and descends, and is transformed into a firmament.",

And all the other parts of the Torah that are not renewed by means of Supernal wisdom appear before the Creator, ascend and become “the lands of life”. They then descend and adorn one land.

So now, when the new explanation on the Torah is uttered, the saying rises up, is crowned, and then stands before the Holy One, blessed be He. And He guards that saying and shelters the person who said it so that it may be known only to Him and to stop the angels from envying him until a new heaven and earth are made from that saying. So it says, \"I have covered you in the shadow of My hand, that I may plant heavens, and lay the foundations of earth.\" And from this we learn that everything which is hidden from the eye has a supernal advantage, as expressed in \"I have covered you in the shadow of My hand.\" But why should it be covered and hidden out of sight? So that it may receive the supernal advantage. As it says, \"that I may plant heavens and lay the foundations of earth,\" as we have learned. ",

Do not pronounce it עַמִּי אָתָּה but rather imi Ata (Eng. 'you are with Me') (meaning), 'be My partner.' Just as I have made the heavens and the earth with My words, as is written, \"By the word of Hashem the heavens were made\" (Psalms 33:6), so shall you (make new heavens and earth.

He emerges from the cavern of the great abyss, makes a leap of 500 parasangs to receive that word, then grabs it, returns with it to his female partner, and makes a false heaven out of it, which is called Tohu (Chaos). The perverse one then flies in that false heaven, traversing 6,000 parasangs in one bound. And as soon as this false heaven is formed, a wife of harlotry emerges, seizes onto this false heaven, and joins it. From there, she leaves to slay by the thousands and tens of thousands.

What is sin? This is the female, namely the wife of harlotry. The gender is implied in the phrase, \"and sin as it were with a cart rope.\" He draws iniquity with these cords of vanity. And afterwards: \"draws sin as it were with a cart rope.\" So he draws upon himself that female, who is called \"sin,\" as she grows strong and flies off to slay human beings. Therefore, \"she has cast down many deadly wounded\" (Proverbs 7:26). Who \"has cast down?\" That sin that slays human beings. And who caused all this?

Here the secret of the verse is revealed to let us know that every time Yisrael sinned, he went away and prevented them from receiving all the blessings and all the lights that shone upon them. \"He slew the Egyptian.\" This is the light, the same Light that shone upon Yisrael. And who is he? Moses. As he is described in the verse, \"And they said an Egyptian man delivered us\" (Ex. 2:19). Because he was born and grew up (in Egypt) until he rose to reach the Supernal Light.",

This is the husband of that \"appearance,\" the glory of Hashem (i.e. Malchut). Because he earned the right to lead this grade over the land, as he wished, a feat that no other man had achieved.",

As it is written, \"With the rod of Hashem in my hand\" (Ex. 17:9). And this is the same rod that was created at the twilight of Shabbat eve and was engraved with the Holy Name by a holy shaping. And with this rod Moses committed the sin of smiting the rock, as is written, \"And he smote the rock with his rod twice\" (Num. 20:11). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: \"Moses, I have not given you My rod for this purpose; by your life, from henceforward, it will not be in your hands any more.\"",

Even though he did not join them and was not included in the count, \"David set him over his guard\" (Ibid.) because he was never separated from the tablet of his heart, because they are inseparable. David gave his heart to him, but he did not (do the same) to David. Because by the hymns and praises together with the kindness that the moon shows for the sun, she draws him (the sun) to reside with her.

So they sat down, began to weep, and could not speak to each other. After a while, Rabbi Abba said, This must be related to what we have learned. When righteous people go on a journey and occupy themselves in the study of the Torah, they are visited by righteous souls from that other world. So this surely must (be why) Rav Hamnuna Saba came to us from that world - to reveal these teachings to us. And before we were able to recognize who he was, he went off and disappeared.They stood up and tried to lead their donkeys on, but the donkeys did not move. They tried to lead them on, but still they did not move. Fear struck them both, and they left the donkeys in their place. And even now, that site is called the \"place of the donkeys.\"",

How great is the heavenly abundance that the Holy One, blessed be He, shall bestow on human beings; to those sin-fearing, divine, and righteous men who learn the Torah as they arrive at the World to Come. It is not only written, \"Your goodness,\" but also \"how great is Your goodness.\" And who is He?  \"The memory of Your goodness\" (Ps. 145:7), which is the pleasure of life that is drawn from the World to Come down to the life of the Worlds. This is\"the memory of your goodness,\" which is certainly \"the great goodness toward the house of Yisrael\" (Isaiah 63:7).",

It is the place where all the secrets are included, the word how (מָה) (means) according to what we have learned. \"Great\" refers to a great and strong tree (Zeir Anpin). Because there is another tree, which is smaller than this one (Malchut), this one is referred to as great and rises up to the highest of the heavens. \"Your Goodness\" is the light that was created on the first day; \"which You have laid up for those who fear You.\" He hid it for the righteous in the World to Come.",

This is what the words \"which You have performed for those who trust in You\" signify. \"In the sight of the sons of men\" (Ps. 31:20). This is the lower Garden of Eden, where all the righteous stand in the spirit, which is clothed in a precious garment, in the same way and form that they appeared in this world. Thus, the phrase \"in the sight of the sons of men\" means in the same form as human beings that live in this world. And they stand there and then rise up in the air, ascending to the celestial Academy in the upper Garden of Eden. They float around and bathe in the dew of the rivers of pure balsam. Then they come down and dwell below. And sometimes (these righteous souls) appear \"in the sight of the sons of man\" to perform miracles for them, just as the angels of above do. And this is exactly like the Light of the supernal shining light that we have just seen. But we did not have the merit of seeing deeper into the secrets of Wisdom and attaining greater knowledge.",

Even though Manoach was not aware of his actions, he still said, it is written, \"For man shall not see Me and live\" (Ex. 33:20). We have certainly seen Him, and therefore we shall certainly die. Yet, we who have seen and have had the privilege of seeing that light that accompanied us shall stay alive, because the Holy One, blessed be He, sent him to us, to teach us the secrets of the Wisdom that he chose to reveal .

They were frightened and (stayed) standing in their places. Then they sat down.

So certainly, the Holy One, blessed be He, was on this path. Furthermore, I see that your faces have changed. Rabbi Yosi said, You have said well, that a sage is preferable to a prophet.",

Then he said, \"Hashem, I have heard a report of You, and I am afraid\" (Habakuk 3:2). Habakuk had said this phrase when he saw his death and his resurrection by Elisha approaching. Why was he called Habakuk? Because, as it is written, \"About this time in the coming year you shall embrace (Heb. חוֹבֶקֶת) a son\" (II Kings 4:16). So Habakkuk was the son of the Shunammite. And there were two embraces: one from his mother and one from Elisha, as it is written, \"and he put his mouth upon his mouth\" (Ibid. 34).",

I have found in the book of King Solomon that the engraved Name that consists of 72 names was engraved on (Habakuk by Elisha; each word had three letters).Because the letters of the alphabet that his father engraved on him from the beginning flew away as he died. And now, when Elisha embraced him, he engraved on him all these letters of the 72 names. Therefore the engraved letters of the 72 names, comprise a total of 216 letters. (72 x 3). And all of these letters that form the 72 names were engraved by Elisha in the spirit of Habakuk to bring him back to life. And he called him Habakkuk, a name that completes all the sides, because it completes two embraces, as mentioned previously. It also completes the secret of the 216 letters of the Holy Name. (Habakuk = 216 in Gematria) By 72 names he revived him and brought his spirit back. And by 216 letters, he revived his body and bodily functions. This is why he is called Habakkuk.",

And he said, \"Hashem, I have heard a report of You, and I am afraid.\" I have heard a report of what I went through and have therefore had a taste of what that the other world is like, and \"I am afraid.\" (This refers to the time between his death and resurrection by Elisha). He started to ask for mercy on his soul by saying, \"Hashem, revive Your work\" in making me; \"in the midst of the years\" (Habakuk 3:2), let his life be  \"revive\" his life. And whoever is connected to those primordial years has life connected to him. The phrase, \"in the midst of the years make known,\" means to bestow life upon that grade that has no life at all of its own, (Malchut of Malchut).",
                "5. Rabbi Shimon wept as he said: Even I have feared the Holy One, blessed be He, from what I have heard. He raised his hands to his head and said, You had the privilege of seeing Rav Hamnuna Saba, the shining light of the Torah, face to face, while I have not. He then fell face downward and saw him uprooting mountains and lighting candles in the temple of King Messiah. He said to him, Rabbi in that world you shall both be neighbors of the heads of the Yeshivot (Academies), before the Holy One, blessed be He. From that day, he called Rabbi Elazar his son, and Rabbi Abba פְּנִי''אֵל. As it is written: \"For I have seen Elohim face to face (Heb. פָּנִים)\" (Gen. 32:31).",

Rabbi Chiya opened the discussion with the verse, \"The fear of Hashem is the beginning of wisdom; good understanding have all they who do His commandments; His praise endures forever\" (Ps. 111:10). Of the phrase, \"the beginning of wisdom,\" this verse have read 'the fear of Hashem is the end of wisdom,' because the fear of Hashem (is the secret of Malchut), which is at the end of Chochmah!  She (Malchut) is the beginning or the first stage that opens the entrance to the level of the supernal Chochmah (Wisdom). So it is written, \"Open to me the gates of righteousness\" (Ibid. 118:19), \"this is the gate to Hashem\" (Ibid. 20). Assuredly, if he does not enter this gate, he shall never reach the Supernal King, because He is exalted, hidden, and concealed, and has made gates for Himself, one behind the other. At the end of all those gates, He set up a gate with many locks, many openings, and many chambers one on top of the other. He said, \"Whoever wants to reach Me must first pass through this gate. Whoever enters this gate, may enter!\" The same applies here, as the first gate to Supernal Wisdom is the \"Fear of Hashem,\" (Malchut). This is why it is called 'The beginning'.",

And of these two Points, one is concealed and treasured, while the other is revealed and out in the open. But because they are not separated, they are called 'The Beginning (Heb. רִאשִׁית)', one and not two. Whoever takes one, takes the other as well, and all is one; because \"He and His Name are One,\" as it is written, \"that men may know that You alone, whose name is Hashem\" (Ps. 83:19). Why is (Malchut) called \"the fear of Hashem?\" Because it is the Tree of Good and Evil, If a person is deserving, then it is good; but if he is not deserving, then it is bad. "

                "Why is Malchut called “fear of the Creator?” It is because Malchut is the Tree of Good and Evil: If man merits, it is good, but if he does not, it is evil. This is why fear dwells in that place. And this gate leads to all the goodness that exists in the world. ALL THE GOODNESS signifies two gates, two points that are as one.",
                "Rabbi Yosi said that ALL THE GOODNESS refers to the Tree of Life, for it is entirely good and completely without evil. And because it is without evil, it is entirely good, without evil. To all those who act, it is the faithful mercy of David that upholds the Torah. Those who keep the Torah seemingly create it themselves. All those who study the Torah – there is no action in them as they study, but those who keep the Torah – in them there is action. And the world exists by this force, eternal are the wisdom and the Torah, and the throne stands just as it should stand.",
                "Rabbi Shimon was sitting and studying the Torah on the night when the Bride, Malchut, unites with her husband, Zeir Anpin. And all the friends present in the bridal chamber on that night, the eve of the holiday of Shavuot, must stand together with the bridegroom under the Huppah, and be with him this whole night, and rejoice with him in the corrections of the Bride, i.e., study the Torah, then Prophets, then Holy Scriptures, and finally the wisdom, for these corrections are the Bride’s adornments. And the Bride receives corrections, adorns herself with them, and rejoices with them all of that night. And on the next day, on the holiday of Shavuot, she only comes to the Huppah together with them. And her friends, who studied the Torah all night long, are called the sons of the Huppah. And as she approaches the Huppah, the Creator asks about them, blesses and adorns them with the Bride’s adornments. Happy are those who merit this!",
                "This is why Rabbi Shimon and all of his friends stayed up that night, and each of them renewed the Torah again and again. Rabbi Shimon was joyous, and so were his friends. Rabbi Shimon said to them: “My sons, how blessed is your lot, for it is you who shall accompany the Bride tomorrow to the Huppah, for all those who correct Her and rejoice in Her this night shall have their names recorded in the Book of Remembrance. And the Creator shall bless them with seventy blessings and adornments of crowns of the Upper World.”",

I have already explained this, but when the bride awakens to enter the Huppah on the following day, with all the friends who rejoiced with her through that night, she rejoices with them, corrects herself and shines with her adornments.” And on the following day, a multitude of masses, hosts, and legions join her. And she, together with all these masses, hosts and legions, awaits all those who corrected her by studying the Torah on that night. This is so because Zeir Anpin unites with Malchut, and she sees her husband, and it is said: “The Heavens declare the Creator’s greatness.” “The Heavens” alludes to the Bridegroom (ZA), who enters the Huppah. “The Heavens declare,” i.e., shine, like the luminescence of a sapphire, upon the entire Malchut, from end to end.",

And now, on the holiday of Shavuot, when she already entered the Huppah, she is called GREATNESS and she is called EL, greatest of the great, luminescent out of the luminescent, dominion over dominions. The hour when the Heaven (ZA) enters the Huppah and shines upon Malchut, all of her friends, who corrected her by studying the Torah, are known by their names, as it is said: “The Heavens declare the work of His hands.” “The work of His hands” refers to the members of this covenant, called “the work of His hands.” As you say: “Confirm for us the work of our hands,” which is the mark of the covenant, imprinted on man’s body.",

If he does so, he shall be dragged to hell. And the ruler of hell, called Domeh, stands at the gates of hell with hundreds of thousands of angels, but he is forbidden to approach those who have kept the holy covenant in this world.",

                "'Master of the universe, in the Torah it says of \"the man that commits adultery with another man's wife...the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death\"' (Lev. 20:10). Furthermore, it is written, \"Moreover, you shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife, to defile yourself with her\" (Lev. 18:20). (So what is to become of) David, who has profaned his organ (of the holy covenant by committing a sexually immoral act)? The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, \"David is righteous! And the holy covenant remains intact, because it is known to Me that Bathsheba was assigned to him since the day the world was created.",
                "2. (Domeh) then said: If this is known to you, it is not known to him. He (Hashem) said to him, 'Not only that, but all that happened was permitted and done lawfully. Because every man that went to war did not leave before he had given a bill of divorce to his wife!' He (Domeh) said to Him, If this is so, he should then have waited for three months, which he did not! Hashem replied: When is this applied? Only in cases where we suspect that she might be pregnant! And it is known to Me for certain that Uriah never touched her. Because My name is sealed in him as a witness. For it is written 'Uriah,' אוּרִיָּה. And it can also be written Uriahu (אוּרִיָּהוּ), 'to show that he is sealed by My Name  that he never had intercourse with her.' Dumah said to Him, Master of the universe, this is exactly what I have said! If it is known to You that Uriah never slept with her, it is not known to him. Therefore, he should have waited for three months. And furthermore, if he knew that he had never slept with her, then why did he send Uriah home and command him to have intercourse with his wife? Since it is written: \"Go down to your house and wash your feet\" (II Samuel 11:8).",
                "3. He said to Dumah, 'He certainly did not know. So he waited more than three months, as four months had passed.' Because we have learned that on the twenty-fifth day of Nissan, David sent an announcement (to go to war). And they were with Yoav on the seventh day of Sivan, as they went and destroyed the land of the children of Amon. There they remained during the months of Sivan, Tammuz, Av, and Elul. And on the twenty-fourth day of Elul the event with Batsheva occurred. Then on Yom Kipur (the Day of Atonement) the Holy One, blessed be He, forgave him for that sin. And there are those who claim that on the seventh day of Adar the announcement was sent, and all arms were gathered on the fifteenth day of Iyar. So what happened with Batsheva occurred on the fifteenth day of Elul. While on Yom Kipur, he received the message \"Hashem also has put away your sin; you shall not die\" (II Samuel 12:13). What is the meaning of \"you shall not die?\" It means that he shall not die at the hand of Dumah.",
                "4. Dumah said, Master of the universe, I have one thing against him! He opened his mouth and said, \"as Hashem lives, the man that has done this deserves to die\" (Ibid. 5). So he has condemned himself to death, and therefore I have the power over him. He said to Dumah, You have no permission, because he has already confessed in front of Me saying, 'I have sinned against Hashem' even though he did not sin. Although his sin against Uriah was (by killing him), I have written his punishment and he has accepted it! Immediately Dumah returned to his place, disappointed. Concerning this David said, \"Unless Hashem had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence (Heb. דּוּמָה)\" (Ps. 94:17). \"Unless Hashem had been my help\" that had He not become David's keeper and guarded him David's \"soul had almost dwelt with Dumah.\" Why does he say \"had almost?\" Because only the smallest distance, as narrow as a thin thread separated him from the Other Side. So \"almost dwelt with Dumah.\" Was just the distance of a thin thread away. ",
                "5. Therefore, every person should be careful not to say what King David said, because he will not be able to say to Dumah, \"it was an error\" (Eccl. 5:5), as it was with David. Because in David's case, the Holy One, blessed be He, defeated (Dumah) in the case. \"Wherefore should Elohim be angry at your voice\" (Ibid.) refers to the voice that said, \"and destroy the work of your hands\" (Ibid.). This is the sacred flesh, the holy covenant that he damaged, and because of which he is to be dragged down to Gehenom by the angel Dumah. And because of this, \"the firmament proclaims His handiwork\" (Ps. 19:2). These are the friends who have joined the Bride, (i.e. Malchut, by studying on Erev Shavuot), together with those who are the custodians of the sign of Her covenant. The firmament shows and registers each and every one of them. What is the firmament? It is where the sun, moon, stars and constellations are located, and it is  the Book of Remembrance. It announces, registers, and inscribes them, so that they can be the residents of its own palace, and it can always fulfill their desires. \"Day to day utters speech\" (Ibid. 3) is an allusion to the sacred day that belongs to those supernal days of the King, that praise the friends. And they say to each other the same words that are written, \"Day to day utters\" that same \"speech,\" thereby praising Him. The words \"and night to night\" refer to the levels that govern the night. They praise one another with the knowledge that each (receives) from its friends. And by this state of harmony and perfection, they become their friends and beloved ones.",
                "6. \"There is no speech nor language\" (Ibid. 4). (This is) the speech and language that belong to worldly matters that are not heard before the Holy King, and that he is not interested in hearing them. But the words, \"Their line is gone out through all the earth\" (Ibid. 5),"

He is happy and runs along these Firmaments. Then, he leaves them and enters into another tower at a different place; this tower comes \"from the end of the heaven\" (Ibid. 7). It certainly comes from the supernal world, which is the upper \"end of the heaven\", \"and his circuit:\"what is his circuit? It is the \"lower end of the heaven\" (i.e. Malchut). This is the circuit of the year that revolves around all the \"ends.\" It is attached to the heavens and extends from there to this firmament. \"And there is nothing hid from His heat\" (Ibid.) means there is nothing hid from His heat, from that circuit, or from the circuit of the sun that revolves in all directions.",
                "3. \"And there is nothing hidden from His heat (or anger)\" means that there is no one from all the supernal levels who can hide from Him; everything revolves and comes to Him - each and everything. Nothing can be hidden from Him. \"From His heat\", He heats up and returns  the instant they have reached full repentance. All this praise and all this glorification is the result of their study of the Torah, as it is written, \"The Torah of Hashem is perfect\" (Ibid. 8). Hashem is mentioned here six times; there are also six verses from \"The heavens declare\" until \"The Torah of Hashem is perfect\" (Ps. 19: 2-8). And based on the same secret it is written, \"In the beginning (Heb. בְּרֵאשִׁית)\" (Gen 1:1). The Hebrew word has six letters; and the phrase \"Elohim created the heaven and the earth  contains six words. The other verses (Ps. 19:8-11) are notable only for the six times that Hashem appears in them. However, the six verses (Ps. 19:2-8) are equated with the six letters (in בְּרֵאשִׁית), while the six Names are equated with the six words (the next six words in the verse).",

He said to them, Certainly the face of the Shechinah has come, and this is why I have called you Peniel (פְּנִי''אֵל). You have seen the face of the Shechinah face to face. Now, because you received the knowledge that was revealed to you by the scripture about Benayahu the son of Jehoida, it is certainly a matter that belongs to Atika Kadisha and  the following verse (I Chron 11:23). And the most concealed spoke it.",

This Egyptian is that one who is known, \"very great in the land of Egypt in the eyes of the servants\" (Ex. 11:3), as he is great and honored. This is how the old man described him.",

All is one, as \"a man of good appearance (II Sam. 23:21)\" and \"a man of good stature\" are both the same, because they represent the Shabbat and the limits. As it is written, \"And you shall measure from outside the city\" (Num. 35:5), and, \"You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard (Heb. מִּדָּה)\" (Lev. 19:35). Therefore, this is a man of great stature (Heb. מִּדָּה) who stretches out from one end of the world to the other. And so was Adam. And if you say, But it is written, \"five cubits?\" (I Chron. 11:23), remember that these five cubits extended from one end of the world to the other! \"And in the Egyptian's hand was a spear, like a weaver's beam\" (Ibid.). It is, as the Scriptures say, \"a weaver's beam,\" referring to the rod of Elohim, which was in his hand and upon which the Name pronounced in full was engraved by Betzalel and his Academy by the radiance of the letter combinations. And this is called \"weaving,\" as is written, \"Them has He filled with wisdom of heart...of the craftsman and of the embroiderer...and of the weaver\" (Ex. 35:35). And the engraved Name shone from within this rod in all directions by the illumination of the wise men that engraved the ineffable Name pronounced in full in forty-two ways. The rest of the passage from here onward is similar to what he has already explained. Happy is his lot! Be seated, my dear ones. Be seated and let us renew the preparations of the Bride for this night. Because whoever joins Her, on this night, shall be guarded above and below for all of the coming year and will complete his year in peace. This is described in the verse, \"The angel of Hashem encamps round about them that fear Him, and He delivers them. O taste and see that Hashem is good\" (Ps. 34:8-9).",
                "7. Rabbi Shimon opened the discussion by saying, \"In the beginning Elohim created\" (Gen. 1:1). This verse has to be examined carefully, because whoever claims that there is another El shall be wiped from the world. As it is already written, \"Thus shall you say to them: The Elohim who have not made the heavens and the earth, they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens\" (Jer. 10:11), because there is no other Creator besides the Holy One, blessed be He, alone!"

                "1. This verse is written in Aramaic, with the exception of the word \"these,\" which appears at the end of the verse. If you suggest that it is because the holy angels do not listen to the translated form and are not familiar with it, this verse should have been said in the holy language so that the holy angels would hear (in order) that they approve of it. This is certainly the reason why it is written in the translated form (Aramaic), as the holy angels do not listen to it. Thus they do not envy man nor do him evil. Because in this verse even the holy angels are included, as they are called Elohim as well, and are included in the term Elohim, yet they have not created the heavens and earth! \"The earth (Aramic אַרְקָא),\" when it should have used the word 'ar'a (Eng. 'land'). Because אַרְקָא is one of the seven lands down below. And in that place, the descendants of Cain live. After he had been banished from the face of the earth, he went down there and begot children. And there he became confused and lost all knowledge. And it is a double land that consists doubly of darkness and light.",
                "2. And there are two ruling commissioners there, one that governs over the darkness and one over the light. And they are hostile to each another. When Cain went down there, they joined one another and made peace. And all realized that they were the descendants of Cain. Therefore, they have two heads, just like two snakes, except when the one who rules over the light overcomes his, namely the light, and overcomes the other, namely the commissioner of the darkness. Accordingly, those that belong to the darkness became included within the light; thus, they became as one. These two commissioners are Afrira and Kastimon, עַפְרִירָא וְקַסְטִימוֹן, and their images are like the images of the holy angels with six wings. One has the image of an ox, and the other the image of an eagle. And only when they become united do they assume the image of man.",
                "3. When they are enveloped with darkness, they change their forms into that of snake with two heads and move like a snake. They fly around in the abyss and bathe in the Great Sea. And when they reach the chains of עַזָּ''א וַעֲזָאֵ''ל, they irritate and arouse them. Then they leap into the mountains of darkness, thinking that the Holy One, blessed be He, wishes to call upon them for judgment. And these two commissioners swim in the Great Sea and fly off from there. They then go at night to נַעֲמָה, the mother of the demons, by whom the first sons of Elohim were misled (Gen. 6:2). Although they wish to go near her, she leaps away 6,000 parasangs. Then she turns, changing into many different shapes in the eyes of human beings, so that they may be led astray after her.",
                "4. And these two commissioners fly off and wander around the entire world. Then they return to their places. And they arouse the descendants of Cain, with a spirit of evil inclinations, to beget children. The heavens that govern there are not like ours, and the land bears neither seed nor fruit by their labor. And the seeds will not grow again until many years and seasons have passed. And these are called, \"The Elohim who have not made the heavens and the earth, they shall perish from the earth\" referring to the upper earth, which is תֵבֵל (Eng. 'world'), so that they may not rule over it and not wander about in it, nor cause human beings to be defiled by nocturnal emission. Therefore, \"they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens\" that were created by the name \"these,\", אֵלֶּה, as we have already learned. Thus, this verse is written in the translated (Aramaic) form in order not to let the supernal angels think that it is said about them - so that they will not be hostile to us. Therefore, the secret of the word \"these (Heb. אֵלֶּה) is as we have already stated. It is a holy word that is not to be translated into Aramaic.",
                "5. Rabbi Elazar said to him, There is a verse that reads, \"Who would not fear You, O King of the nations? For to You it is fitting\" (Jer. 10:7). What sort of praise is this? He (Rashb\"i) answered him: Elazar my son, this verse has been said in many places. And certainly it is not so; because it is written, \"For among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You\" (Ibid.). And this is written as an excuse for the sinners, who think that the Holy One, blessed be He, is not aware of their plans and their thoughts. And because of this, their folly should be announced in the open. Because once a philosopher of the nation approached me, and said, You claim that your Elohim governs the entire heights of the heavens, and all the heavenly hosts and legions are not able to approach Him, nor do they know His place. But here, this verse does not add a lot to His honor. As it is written, \"as among all the wise men of the nations...there is none like You.\" What kind of a comparison is this, to be compared with human beings"

And furthermore, since you commented \"And there arose not a prophet since in Yisrael like Moses\" (Deut. 34:10), that only in Yisrael has there not arisen, but among the other nations of the world, one like him has indeed risen. So I claim the same, that among all the wise men of the nations...there is none like to Him! But among the wise men of Yisrael there is! And therefore, Elohim who has an equal among the wise men of Yisrael is not an all-powerful Elohim. Look closely into the verse, and you shall see that I am precisely correct! I said to him, what you have said is definitely correct,",
                "3. because who raises the dead and brings them back to life? It is the Holy One, blessed be He, alone! Yet Elijah and Elisha came and raised the dead back to life. Who causes rain to fall? It is the Holy One, blessed be He, alone! Yet Elijah came and prevented rain, then caused it to fall through his prayer. Who made the heavens and the earth? It was the Holy One, blessed be He, alone! Yet Abraham came and the heavens and the earth were properly established because of him. Who governs the sun? It is the Holy One, blessed be He, alone! Yet Joshua came and silenced it, commanding it to stand still in its place - and it stood still in silence. As it is written, \"And the sun stood still and the moon stayed\" (Joshua 10:13). The Holy One, blessed be He, issues decrees, yet Moses as well issued a decree, and it was fulfilled. Furthermore, the Holy One, blessed be He, issues decrees, while the righteous of Yisrael cancel them. As it is written: \"just, ruling (in) the fear of Elohim\" (II Sam. 23:3). Even more so, He has commanded them to walk along (literally) 'in His steps' and to be like Him in every way! The philosopher then went to Kfar Shachalayim and became a proselyte. And they called him Yosi the young. He studied much and joined the wise and pious men of that place.",
                "4. We should have a closer look at this verse, now. It is written: \"All the nations are as nothing before Him\" (Isaiah 40:17). What is so special about this? He answers Rather, \"Who would not fear You, O King of the nations?\" (Jer. 10:7) is He the King of the other nations, and not the King of Yisrael?! The Holy One, blessed be He, wishes to be glorified by Yisrael. Therefore, He is always called in relation to the name of Yisrael, as is written, \"Elohim of Yisrael,\" \"Elohim of the Hebrews\" (Ex. 5:3). Also it is written: \"Thus says Hashem, the King of Yisrael\" (Isaiah 44:6) - the King of Yisrael explicitly! The other nations of the world said, We have a different Guardian up in the heavens, because your King governs over you alone, and not over us.",
                "5. Thus, this verse that reads: \"Who would not fear You, O King of the nations,\" which means that He is a Supernal King, has dominion over them, punishes them and controls them, as He wishes to \"...for to You it is fitting\" to be feared above and below\" \"For among all the wise men of the nations\" refers to the governors and rulers who govern them. \"And in all their kingdoms\" (Jer. 10:7) refers to the kingdom above. There are four ruling kingdoms above, and they govern all the other nations according to the desire of Hashem. And even with all this, they are not able to accomplish even the tiniest deed without Him commanding them. As it is written, \"and He does according to His will in the host of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth\" (Daniel 4:32). The \"wise men of the nations\" are the governors and rulers of above, from whom the Wisdom of other nations is derived. \"And in all their kingdoms\" refers to the aforementioned kingdom that rules, which is the literal meaning of the verse.",
                "6. But: \"for among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms.\" These words I found in the books of the ancients, that even though they, the hosts and legions, were put in charge of worldly affairs and He ordered each one to fulfill his mission, who can do it like You?! Because You are marked by excellence and by Your deeds. And this is the meaning of \"There is none like You\" (Ibid.), Hashem. Who is the holy and concealed, above and below, who can do what You do, or be like You, in all the doings of the Holy King up in the heavens, or down on earth?! So they \"are all of them vain, and the things they delight in do not help\" (Isaiah 44:9). While of the Holy One, blessed be He, it is written, \"In the beginning Elohim created,\" (Gen. 1:1) and about their kingdom, it is written, \"and the earth was without form and void\" (Ibid).",
                "7. Rabbi Shimon addressed the friends, saying, 'Members of this wedding, let each of you adorn the Bride with a certain decoration of his'. He said to Rabbi Elazar his son: 'Elazar, present the Bride with a gift! So that on the following day, when He, (i.e. Zeir Anpin) enters under the bridal canopy followed by the songs and praises that the members of the bridal canopy offered her, you may stand before Him.",
                "8. Rabbi Elazar opened the discussion by quoting, \"Who is this coming up out of the wilderness?\" (Song of Songs 3:6). \"Who is this\" is the joining of two kinds of holiness, of two worlds (Binah and Malchut), into one firm bond. \"Coming up (Heb. עוֹלָה),\" means that it actually comes up to become the Holy of Holies. Because \"Who,\" מִ''י, (corresponding to Binah), is the Holy of Holies and has joined \"this,\" זֹא''ת (corresponding to Malchut), so that she (Malchut) will be a burnt offering (Heb. עוֹלָה) which is the highest class of sacrifices (lit. \"Holy of Holies'). \"Out of the wilderness,\" means that this inherits it from the wilderness in order to become a bride and enter the bridal canopy. Furthermore she came out of the wilderness (Heb. מִּדְבָּר) as it is written, \"And your speech (Heb. מִדְבָּרֵךְ) is comely\" (Song of Songs 4:3)"

But is it possible that all the Holy One, blessed be He, brought about occurred only in the wilderness? Was it not in the place of habitation? But the phrase \"in the wilderness\" (Heb. בַּמִּדְבָּר) (refers to) by speech (Heb. בְּדִבּוּרָא). As it is written, \"and your speech is comely,\" and, \"from the desert (Heb. בַּמִּדְבָּר) peaks\" (Ps. 75:7). Similarly \"coming up out of the wilderness\" (Song of Songs 3:6) means by the word that is uttered by the mouth, she (Malchut) is \"coming up\" and enters between the wings of the Mother, she (Binah). Afterwards, through speech, she (Malchut) descends and rests upon the leaders of the holy nation.",
                "3. How does she, Malchut, rise up through speech? Because when a person awakens in the morning - at the time that he opens his eyes - he should at first bless his Master. How is he to make the blessing? This is what the pious ones did: They prepared beside for themselves a vessel of water, and when they awoke at night, they washed their hands, rose up, and studied the Torah. And they blessed on their Torah recitation as well! When the cock crows and it is exactly midnight, then the Holy One, blessed be He, joins the Righteous in the Garden of Eden. It is forbidden to utter any blessing in the morning with unclean hands, as it is at any time of the day.",
                "4. Because when a person falls asleep, his spirit departs from him. And when the spirit departs from him, the spirit of impurity comes forth, settles on his hands, and defiles them. So it is forbidden to utter any blessing without first washing. And if you might say, If it is so, then on a day when a person does not go to sleep and his spirit does not depart from him, the spirit of impurity does not defile his hands; nevertheless, when he enters the lavatory, he should not utter any blessing nor read the Torah - not even one word - until he washes his hands. And although you might say that it is because they are sullied, this is not so! Because how did they become soiled? Woe to those people who are not aware and do not pay heed to their Master's glory, and do not know what the world is based on. Because there is a certain spirit that dwells in every privy in the world, a spirit that enjoys dirt and excrement, and immediately settles on the fingers of the hands of that man.",
                "5. Rabbi Shimon opened the discussion by saying that he who rejoices on festivals, but does not give his portion to the Holy One, blessed be He, then that Evil Eye Satan, רַע עַיִן שָׂטָן - shall hate and persecute him, and shall take him out of this world. And he will bring many miseries upon miseries. The portion of the Holy One, blessed be He, is to make the poor happy, according to his ability. Because on these days, (festivals) the Holy One, blessed be He, comes to see all His broken vessels. He comes to see them, but then realizes that they have nothing to be happy about And He weeps over them, before ascending back above, to destroy the world.",

He said to them: 'Have I not created the world based upon love?' As it is written, \"For I have said, the world is built by love\" (Ps. 89:3). So the whole universe is established upon it. The heavenly angels then say to Him, Master of the universe, there is a certain person who has eaten and drunk to his fill and could have been kind to the poor, but did not share with them anything!

Of the day that he prepared a feast, what is written? \"And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Issac was weaned\" (Gen. 21:8). So Abraham prepared a feast and invited all the leaders and important people of that generation to that feast. And we have learned that at every banquet, the 'Accuser' wanders about, observing if each person first dispenses charity to the poor. If there are any poor people in his house, then he (the \"Accuser\") leaves that house and does not enter. But if not, the Accuser enters that house. If he sees the merrymaking without the poor and without having first dispensed charity to the poor, he ascends above and brings accusations against him.",

Abraham was attending the kings and the noble men. Sarah suckled all their children because they did not believe that she had born a child, but rather claimed that he was a foundling whom they picked up from the marketplace. This is why they brought their children with them, so that Sarah could take them and nurse them in front of their parents. As it is written: "

                "2. So immediately the 'Accuser' went up and stood before the Holy One, blessed be He, and said to Him, \"O Master of the universe, You have said, 'Abraham is the one who loves Me,' and here he prepared a feast but did not give anything to You or to the poor. He did not sacrifice even one pigeon before. And furthermore, Sarah claims that You have mocked her!\" The Holy One, blessed be He, replies: 'Who in the world can be compared to Abraham?' But he did not leave the place until he had spoiled the entire feast. So the Holy One, blessed be He, decreed that Issac should be given as an offering, and Sarah was destined to die from anguish because of her son. All of this distress was caused because he did not offer anything to the poor!",
                "3. Rabbi Shimon opened the discussion by speaking about the verse: \"Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Hashem\" (Isaiah 38:2). Come and see how powerful is the might of the Torah, and how high it rises above all! Because whoever conducts his life according to the Torah has no fear of those above or below, and mishaps or illnesses of this world do not concern him. Through the Torah, he is attached to the Tree of Life and learns from it every day.",
                "4. The Torah teaches every person how to walk a straight path. It gives advice how to repent and return to one's Master to cancel the decree against him. Because even though a decree has been given not to cancel the decree against him, it shall nevertheless be canceled and not be applied to him anymore in this world. So for this purpose, man should occupy himself in the study of the Torah day and night, not deviate from it. As it is written, \"you shall meditate therein day and night\" (Joshua 1:8). So if he deviates from the Torah - or he abandons it - it is as though he abandons the Tree of Life.",

When a person lies on his bed at night and goes to sleep, he should wholeheartedly accept upon himself the heavenly Kingdom, and he should quickly prepare to return his entrusted soul to Him. Then he shall be immediately spared from all bad diseases and evil spirits, and they shall have no power over him. And in the morning, as he rises from his bed, he should then praise his Master, enter into His house, and bow in front of His sanctuary in great awe. And afterward, he should recite his prayers. For he should take advice from the holy patriarchs, as it is written, \"But as for me, I will come into Your house in the multitude of Your love; and in the fear of You, I will bow down toward Your holy temple\" (Ps. 5:8).",
                "6. This verse has been explained as follows. A person should not enter the synagogue unless he first consulted Abraham, Issac and Jacob. Because they have prepared and instituted the prayer to the Holy One, blessed be He. As it is written, \"I will come into Your house in the multitude of Your love\" refers to Abraham, (Chesed); \"I will bow down towards Your holy temple\" refers to Issac; \"in the fear of You\" refers to Jacob (Tiferet). Therefore, he should include himself with them and then enter the synagogue and recite his prayers.

There is a person who fears and respects the Holy One, blessed be He, so that his children will live and not die, or because he is afraid to be punished through his body or his wealth. This person, therefore, is always afraid of Him. But we can see that the fear he has of the Holy One, blessed be He, has no actual source (is not really genuine). And there is a person who fears the Holy One, blessed be He, because he is afraid of the punishment that awaits him in the other world, and the tortures of Gehenom.

And if I do not say, the friends shall lose this matter.

This is a lash used for the whipping of the wicked. So, he who fears because of the punishment of being whipped and prosecuted, as is already stated, does not have that fear of Hashem that is called \"the fear of Hashem tends to life\" (Prov. 19:23). Then what fear is such a person endowed with? It is evil fear. And so he is ruled by that whipping lash, the evil fear, and not the fear of Hashem.",

He who does not observe the precept of fear does not observe any of the precepts of the Torah. Because this (fear) is the gateway to everything! Because of this, it is written, \"In the Beginning,\" which is \"fear\", \"Elohim created the heaven and the earth.\" Because, whoever transgresses this, transgresses all of the precepts of the Torah. And the punishment for he who transgresses is this cruel and evil lash, which shall whip him. Therefore \"and the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and a wind from Elohim\" (Gen. 1:2) are the four punishments for the wicked.",
                "42. \"Without form\" means strangulation, as it is written, \"a line of confusion\" (Isaiah 34:11) that is \"a measuring line\" (Zech. 2:5). \"Void\" means stoning and refers to the stones that are sunk in the great deep for the purpose of punishing the wicked. And \"darkness\" means burning. As it is written, \"And it came to pass, when you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain did burn with fire\" (Deut. 5:20). And this fierce fire \"shall fall upon the head of the wicked\" (Jer. 23:19) to burn them. And \"a wind\" means slaughtering by the sword. Because the tempest storm is a flaming, sharp sword that burns within it. As it is written, \"and the bright blade of a revolving sword\" (Gen. 3:24). And it is also called a wind. So this is the punishment for whoever transgresses the precepts of the Torah. Because it appears after fear that is called Beginning and includes everything. From here onward, come the rest of the precepts of the Torah.",
                "43. The second precept is that the precept of fear is strongly attached to and never disconnected from the precept of love. A person should love his Master wholly. And what is perfect love? It is great love, as it is written, \"walk before Me and be perfect\" (Gen. 17:1). Meaning, to be whole with love. Thus it is written, \"And Elohim said, Let there be light\" (Gen. 1:3). This perfect love is called great love. And here it appears as a precept, that a person should love his Master properly.",
                "44. Rabbi Elazar said: My father, I have heard that meaning of perfect love. He said to him: Say it, my son, in front of Rabbi Pinchas, as he is truly on that level. Rabbi Elazar said: Great love means perfect love,  perfected from both sides. And if it does not include both, then "
            ],
            [
                "1. ...include both, then it is not a proper perfect love!",
                "2. This is why we have learned that the love of the Holy One, blessed be He, is explained in two ways. There is he who loves Him because he is rich, has length of life, his children are around him, he rules his enemies, and he succeeds in his ventures. Because of all these, he loves Him. But if it were the opposite, if the Holy One, blessed be He, were to turn the wheel of fortune against him and replace this with harsh judgment, he would then hate Him and not love Him at all. Therefore, this love is not a love that has a base. ",
                "3. The love that is called whole is that love that is included from both sides, from both Judgment, Chesed and success. He should love the Holy One, blessed be He, as we have learned; even if He was to take away your soul. This is the perfect love that includes both aspects. And because of this, the light of the acts of Creation was revealed and then hidden. When it was hidden, harsh judgment came forth and both aspects became united and reached perfection. This is proper love. ",
                "4. Rabbi Shimon hugged and kissed him. Then Rabbi Pinchas came and kissed and blessed him. He then said: Certainly, the Holy One, blessed be He, has sent me here. This is that tiny ray of light that I was told shines in my house, and later on shall lighten up the entire world.\" Rabbi Elazar said: Certainly, fear should not be omitted from the precepts, especially from this one (love). So fear should be attached to it. How is it attached? Love brings good from one side. As it is explained: when the Holy One, blessed be He, gives a person riches and all goodness, length of life, children, and sustenance, then that person should arouse in himself fear. And he should be afraid of what the sin might bring upon him. Of this it is written, \"Happy is the man that fears always\" (Proverbs 28:14), because fear is now included with love. ",
                "5. This is how fear should be aroused - from the other aspect of harsh Judgment. Because once a person realizes that harsh Judgment prevails upon him, he shall arouse fear in himself and be afraid of his Master. Thus, he will not harden his heart. This is what is meant by the verse, \"he that hardens his heart shall fall into evil\" (Proverbs 28:14), which refers to the Other Side that is called 'evil'. Thus, fear is attached to and includes them both. ",
                "6. The third precept is to know that there is a great Elohim who governs the world; and to proclaim His unity properly every day, using the supernal six extremities  (Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod and Yesod of Zeir Anpin); to unify them into one whole by the six words of Sh'ma Yisrael; and to concentrate them above. Therefore, we should prolong the pronunciation of the word Echad to the time to pronounce the six words. This is the reason why it is written, \"Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together to one place\" (Genesis 1:9). Let all the grades that are below the heaven be gathered into one place, so the six extremities will be in a state of perfection as they should. Nevertheless, even with the proclamation of His unity fear should be attached to it. So one should prolong the pronunciation of the letter Dalet in the word Echad. This is why the letter Dalet is large. Thus it is written, \"and let the dry land appear\" (Ibid.), which means let the letter Dalet, which is dry land, be seen and attached to that unification. ",
                "7. And after (Malchut) is attached above, she should then be attached down below to her multitudes, to the other six directions which are down below. 'Blessed be the name of the glory of His Kingdom for ever and ever', (Heb. בָּרוּךְ שֵׁם כְּבוֹד מַלְכוּתוֹ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד) which in Hebrew contains six additional words expressive of this unity. And then what was dry land becomes fertile soil that can produce fruits and flowers, and in which trees can be planted. This is implied in the verse, \"And Elohim called the dry land earth\" (Ibid. 10). This was accomplished by the unity below, a properly complete desire. And this is why the expression \"that it was good\" appears twice; once for the upper and once for the lower unity. So (Malchut) has been united with both aspects. Hence, it is written, \"Let the earth bring forth grass\" (Ibid. 11), because by now she has been prepared to produce fruit and flowers properly!",
                "8. The fourth precept: to know that Hashem is the Elohim. As it is written, \"Know this day, and consider it in your heart, that Hashem He is the Elohim\"(Deuteronomy 4:39). Meaning, that the name Elohim is included in the name of Hashem, and acknowledged as one and inseparable. And this is the secret of the verse, \"Let there be luminaries (Heb. מְאֹרֹת) in the firmament of heaven...to give light upon the earth\" (Genesis 1:14-15), that both names should be as one without any separation. Thus, מְאֹרֹת, spelled without a Vav, should be included within the term heaven, because they are as one and inseparable. Black light (Malchut) within white light (Zeir Anpin). Both are as one without separation."
            ],
            [
                "1. And this is the white cloud by day and the cloud of fire by night, the attribute of day, and the attribute of night, as they should be established by each other into one whole, to illuminate. As it is written, \"to give light upon the earth.\"",
                "2. This is the sin of the primeval serpent, who unites down below but separates above. Because of this, he caused what he caused to the world. Because what is below should be separated, and what is above should be united. So the black light should be united above into one unified whole. And then she should become united together with her own legions and be separated from the evil side. Nevertheless, it is necessary to know that Elohim and Yud Hei Vav Hei are one without separation. Yud Hei Vav Hei He is Elohim. So when a person acknowledges that both are one and does not cause any separation between them, even the 'Other Side' will disappear from the world and not be drawn downward.",
                "3. This is the secret behind the words, \"And let them be for luminaries (Heb. מְאֹרֹת)\" (Genesis 1:14), which is formed from the two words אוֹר (Eng. 'Light') and מָוֶת (Eng. 'death') because the Kelipah follows the Brain and the Brain is the light; the Other Side is death. The letters forming the word אוֹר are kept together, while the letters forming the word מָוֶת are separated from one another. The light is gone from there, the separated letters of death join one another.  Eve meddled with these letters and brought evil to the world. As it is written, \"And when the woman saw that...was good\" (Heb. וַתֵּרֶא) (Genesis 3:6), she turned the letters of Me'orot backwards, that is she removed the letters of וַתֵּרֶא from there, leaving only the letters Mem and Vav. And they went along and took the letter Tav with them, (death). This is how she brought death upon the world, as the scriptures inform us. \"וַתֵּרֶא...\" (Genesis 3:6). Rabbi Elazar said: Father, I have learned that after Eve had removed the letters of וַתֵּרֶא from the word Me'orot, not the letters Mem and Vav remained, but only Mem remained above, Vav, which is always life, turned into Mavet. When it left and took the letter Tav, as it is written, \"she took (Heb. וַתִּקַּח)...and gave (Heb.  וַתִּתֵּן)\" (Ibid.), so the word Mavet was completed, as its letters joined one another. He said to him: Blessed are you my son, as we have now clarified this subject. ",
                "4. The fifth precept is found in the verse, \"Let the waters swarm abundantly with moving creatures that have life\" (Genesis 1:20). This verse contains three precepts. The first is to study the Torah; the second is to beget children: and the third is to circumcise a male child on the eighth day of life and remove the foreskin. It is necessary to study the Torah with great effort at all times, in order to better one's spirit and soul.",
                "5. As a person labors in the study of the Torah, he is endowed with an additional holy soul, as it is written, \"moving creatures (lit. 'soul') that have life.\" This refers to the holy living creature (Malchut). If a person does not delve in the study of the Torah, he does not receive this holy soul, and the holiness of above does not rest upon him. However, when he does study the Torah, he merits that living soul by his mouthing the words of the Torah. Thus he becomes like the angels of above. As it is written, \"Bless Hashem, you angels of His\" (Psalms 103:20). This refers to those who study the Torah and are called \"His angels\" on earth. ",
                "6. And it is also written, \"And let birds fly above the earth\" (Genesis 1:20). This refers to this world, but as far as the other world is concerned, we have learned that the Holy One, blessed be He, will provide them with wings like those of the eagles to allow them to meander around in all the worlds. As is written, \"But they that wait upon Hashem shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles\" (Isaiah 40:31). Thus it is written, \"and let birds fly above the earth,\" because the Torah that is called \"the waters\" (Genesis 1:20) abounds, bringing forth expressions of the living soul, that is aroused from its place of living creature, to be drawn down below, as we have learned. And this is what King David referred to, when he said, \"Create in me a clean heart, O Elohim\" (to study and learn the Torah), and then \"renew a steadfast spirit within me\" (Psalms 51:12). ",
                "7. The sixth precept is to procreate. Because he who procreates and begets children causes that river to flow continuously. Its waters shall never fail and the sea shall be filled from all directions. New souls are renewed and shall come forth from that tree, and many hosts of heaven will multiply together with those souls. This is why it is written, \"Let the waters swarm abundantly with moving creatures that have life.\"This refers to the sign of the holy covenant, the river that flows and comes forth, as its waters swell and move with swarms and innumerable souls for that living creature! ",
                "8. Together with those souls that enter the living creature, many birds come forth. They fly around and roam the entire world, so that when a soul comes forth and is on its way down to this world, the bird that flew off and left with that soul from the same tree accompanies it! How many leave together with each soul? Two! One on the right and one on the left. If he is worthy, they guard him. As it is written, \"For He will give His angels charge over you\" (Psalms 91:11). But if he is not worthy, then they prosecute him. ",
                "9. Rabbi Pinchas said: "
            ],
            [
                "1. There are three angels that are guardians over a person, if he is worthy. As it is written, \"If there be an angel over him, a defender, one among a thousand to declare to man what is right\" (Job 33:23); \"if there be an angel,\" this is one; \"a defender,\" this is two; \"one among a thousand,\" this is three! Rabbi Shimon said: There are five. Because the verse continues, \"Then he is gracious to him and says...\" (Ibid. 24). \"He is gracious,\" this is one angel, and \"and says,\" this is a second, so there are five. Rabbi Pinchas said: This is not so! \"He is gracious to him,\" refers to the Holy One, blessed be He, by Himself. Because nobody else is permitted to be gracious to Him Himself.",
                "2. Rabbi Shimon replied: You have said well! And he who abstains from procreating belittles, so to speak, the form that includes all forms. And he blocks the flow of the waters of that river as he renders defective the sign of the holy covenant from all sides. Of such a person, it is written, \"And they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have rebelled against Me\" (Isaiah 66:24). \"Against Me\" for sure! And this is said about the body, as the soul shall never enter beyond the curtain, and it shall be banished from that world.",
                "3. The seventh precept is to perform circumcision on the eighth day of life and remove the defilement of the foreskin. Because that living creature is the eighth grade, compared to the other grades. And that soul that flies away and emerges from it must appear before it on the eighth day, as it in itself is the eighth grade. And then it is made clear that it is a living soul. A soul that belongs to that holy living creature and not to the Other Side. And this is alluded to by the words, \"Let the waters swarm abundantly\" (Genesis 1:20). This has been explained in the book of Enoch as, \"Let the waters of the holy seed be stamped by the impression of the living soul.\" And this alludes to the impression that the letter Yud marked upon the holy flesh, more than any other mark that exists in the world.",
                "4. \"And let birds fly above the earth\" (Ibid.). This refers to Elijah, who flies over the entire world in four flights to be present at every place where the sacred circumcision is performed. So a chair should be prepared for him, and it should be said out loud, This is the chair of Elijah. If this is not done, he will not appear! \"And Elohim created great crocodiles\"(Ibid. 21). Two, and these two include the removal of the foreskin and the uncovering of the corona. And these two are male and female. \"and every living creature that moves\" (Ibid). This refers to the mark of the sign of the holy covenant, which is the holy living creature, as we have previously stated. \"...which the waters brought forth abundantly,\" these are the supernal waters that are drawn down into the sign of this mark.",
                "5. This is the reason why Yisrael down below are marked by the holy and pure impression, similar to the holy impressions. This distinguishes the holy side from the Other Side. Thus are they marked, to distinguish the holiness of Israel from the impure idol worshiping nations that originate from the Other Side, as we have learned. Just as He marked Israel, so did He mark their cattle and their fowl to distinguish them from the cattle and fowl of the idol worshiping nations. Happy is the portion of Yisrael!",
                "6. The eighth precept is to love the convert who comes to be circumcised and desires to enter under the wings of the Shechinah. And She (Malchut) takes under Her wings those who separate themselves from the defiled Other Side, and approach Her. As it is written: \"Let the earth bring forth the living creatures after their kind\" (Genesis 1:24). And in case you might say that this living soul, which includes Yisrael, is assigned to everyone, He repeats, \"after their kind\". O how many corridors and chambers, one inside the other, does the earth which is living have under its wings!",
                "7. The right wing has two chambers, and from this wing, two nations come forth. They are close with regard to Unity to Yisrael and enter into these chambers. And under the left wing there are two additional chambers that are divided between two other nations, which are Ammon and Moab. And they are all called living soul. And how many other closed chambers are there in each and every wing. From these chambers souls go forth and are divided among those proselytes who are converted, and these are called living soul, but \"after their kind.\" They all enter under the wings of the Shechinah, but do not go beyond. But the soul of Yisrael comes from the body of that tree. And from there, the souls fly off down into this earth, down deep inside its bowels! And the secret behind this is as written: \"For you shall be a land of delight\" (Malachi 3:12). Therefore, Yisrael is the darling son for whom She yearns from the bottom of Her heart. And Yisrael are called \"who are borne by Me from birth (lit. 'belly')\"(Isaiah 46:3) and not from the wings that are on the outside. And furthermore, "
            ],
            [
                "1. the proselytes have no part in the upper tree, especially not in its body (trunk). So their place is in the wings and not beyond. Therefore, the convert's place is under the wings of the Shechinah, and not higher. And the true proselytes are those who reside there - and not inside. This is why it is said: \"Let the earth bring forth the living creatures after their kind.\" And to whom? \"Cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after their kind\" (Genesis 1:24). All draw their spirit from within that living creature, but each one according to its kind, as is appropriate to it!",
                "2. The ninth precept is to show mercy to the needy and supply them with food. As it is written: \"Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness\" (Genesis 1:26). \"Let Us make man\" is used in the compound sense, indicating that it includes Male and Female. \"In Our image\",  the rich; \"after Our likeness\", the poor. Because from the aspect of the Male, they are rich; from the aspect of the Female, they are poor. But as they are united as one, show compassion to each other, share with each other, and are benefactors to each other, so should man below behave. The rich and the poor should be united together as one, and should share with each other and be benefactors to each other.",
                "3. \"And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea\" (Ibid.). We have seen this secret in the Book of King Solomon, where it says that if a person has pity on the poor from all his heart, his image shall not be changed and shall remain forever as that of the first man. As a result of having the mark of the image of Adam, he therefore shall rule over all creatures on earth by that image. As it is written, \"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast\" (Genesis 9:2). All have fear of that image and dread the image marked on him, because this is the most praised precept. It is above all the others, because by this precept, the Son of Man is able to elevate himself by the image of Adam.",
                "4. How do we know this? From Nebuchadnezzar! Because even though he dreamt that dream, as long as he had mercy upon the poor, the dream did not come true. But because he cast the evil eye on the poor not to be gracious to them, what does the verse say? It reads, \"While the word was in the king's mouth\" (Daniel 4:28), his image immediately changed and he was rejected from people. This is why, \"Let Us make man\" (Genesis 1:26). Here the term \"to make\" is used. So in the verse it is written, \"The man's name where I worked (lit. 'made') today is Boaz\" (Ruth 2:19). ",
                "5. The tenth precept is to put on Tefilin, and to complete himself with the supernal image. As it is written, \"And Elohim created man in His own image\" (Genesis 1:27). He opened the discussion by saying: \"Your head upon you is like the Carmel\" (Song of Songs 7:6). This verse has already been explained. Nevertheless, \"Your head upon you is like the Carmel\" applies to the supernal head - the Tefilin worn on the head of the holy Supernal King Yud Hei Vav Hei that appears in the written letters: Each letter is equivalent to one paragraph. The Holy Name is engraved according to the proper order of the letters. And we have learned that the verse \"that you are called by the name of Hashem, and they shall be afraid of you\" (Deuteronomy 28:10) refers to the Tefilin of the head, which represent the Holy Name, according to the order of the letters.",
                "6. The first words that appear in the Tefilin read, \"Sanctify to Me all the firstborn (Heb. קַדֶּשׁ לִי...)\" (Exodus 13:2). This corresponds to Yud, which is holiness - which is the firstborn of all the supernal sanctities. These are \"whatever opens the womb\" (Exodus 13:12) by that narrow line that descends from the Yud, which opens the womb to bring forth proper fruit and seeds. This is the supernal holiness.",
                "7. The second paragraph reads, \"And it shall be when Hashem shall bring you (Heb.  וְהָיָה כִי יְבִיאֲךָ)\" (Exodus 13:5). This is Hei. This is the temple whose womb is opened by the letter Yud through fifty openings, corridors and rooms that are concealed within it. The letter Yud made an opening in that temple so that the sound of the Shofar can be heard through it. Because the Shofar is blocked on all sides, Yud came and opened it so that the sound could be heard. When it opened it, the Shofar was blown and sound was emitted. The emission of this sound was to free the slaves. So by blowing of the Shofar, Yisrael were delivered from Egypt. And so another time in the future, at the End of Days. Every deliverance originates from this Shofar. And this is why the exodus from Egypt is written in this paragraph. Because it is a result of this Shofar - by the force of the letter Yud - that the womb was opened, enabling it to bring forth its sound to redeem the slaves. This is Hei, the second letter of the Holy Name.",
                "8. The third paragraph is the secret of the unification in \"Hear O Yisrael (Heb. שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל)\" (Deuteronomy 6:4). This corresponds to the letter Vav and combines all within; itself - the unity of all, as all are united in it. And it gathers all, as well! The fourth paragraph reads, \"And it shall come to pass, if you shall hearken (Heb. וְהָיָה אִם שָׁמוֹעַ)\" (Deuteronomy 11:13). This includes two aspects (Chesed and Gevurah)"
            ],
            [
                "1. combined together because the Congregation of Yisrael, which is the lower Gevurah, is united with them. And this is the last Hei, which gathers all the others together and includes them all. The Tefilin are actually the letters of the Holy Name. Therefore, \"Your head upon you is like the Carmel\" - the Tefilin of the head. \"And the hair (Heb. dalat) from dalah (poor) of your head\" (Song of Songs 7:6) refers to the Tefilin of the hand, as she is poor, in comparison to above. Thus, she achieves perfection as above! \"a king is caught in its tresses\" (Ibid. 6), that he is tied down and tightly held in those compartments for the purpose of being properly united with that Holy Name. Therefore, whoever puts them on receives the image of Elohim. Because just as Elohim is united with the Holy Name, so does the person who puts them on become united with the Holy Name accordingly. \"Male and female He created them\" (Genesis 1:27) - the Tefilin of the head and the Tefilin of the hand - and all is one (the same)!",
                "2. The eleventh precept is to give a tithe of the land's product. Here we have two precepts. One is to give a tithe of the land's product, and the other is {to bring} the first fruits of the trees. As it is written, \"Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth\" (Genesis 1:29). Here it is written, \"I have given you;\" elsewhere it is written, \"And to the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Yisrael\" (Numbers 18:21). In a third place, it is further written, \"And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is to Hashem\" (Leviticus 27:30).",
                "3. The twelfth precept - to bring the first fruits of the trees as an offering. As it is written, \"and every tree, on which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed\" (Genesis 1:29). Whatever I deserve is forbidden to you to eat. He permitted them (to eat) and gave them all His tithe and first fruits of the trees. \"I have given to you\" - \"to you,\" and not to the generations after you. ",
                "4. The thirteenth precept - to perform the redemption ritual for his firstborn son and connect him to life. There are two appointees in charge - one over life and one over death - and they both stand beside man. Thus, when a person redeems his son, he redeems him from that one over death and takes him out of his control. This is the secret of the words, \"And Elohim saw everything that He had made\" (Genesis 1:31). In general. \"And, behold it was...good\" (Ibid.) alludes to the Angel of Life, while the word \"very (Heb. מְאֹד)\" alludes to the Angel of Death. Therefore, by this act of redemption, the Angel of Life is strengthened and the one of Death is weakened. By this redemption, he acquires life for himself, as has been mentioned, so that the evil side leaves him alone and does not cling to him any more.",
                "5. The fourteenth precept - to observe the Shabbat, which is a day of rest from all the acts of Creation. There are two precepts included here. One is to observe the day of the Shabbat, and one is to attach this day to its holiness. So \"to observe the day of the Shabbat\" is, as I have mentioned and explained, that it is a day of rest to all the worlds. And all actions are within that day and were already performed even before that day was sanctified. When that day was sanctified, the creation of the bodies for certain spirits was not completed. Was not the Holy One, blessed be He, aware of that, so that He could delay the sanctification of that day until the bodies for those spirits were created? The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil - aroused the evil Other Side, who wanted to rule over the world. So a lot of spirits were dispersed with much weaponry to achieve strength with the bodies of this world.",
                "6. As the Holy One, blessed be He, saw this, He aroused a tempest from within the Tree of Life, and struck upon the other Tree, causing the arousal of the other Good Side. Consequently, the day was sanctified. Because the creation of the bodies and the arousal of the spirits, on that night  comes from the Good Side and not from the Other Side. Had the Other Side come during that night before the Good Side, then the world would not have been able to exist for even one moment. So the Holy One, blessed be He, provided the remedy in advance. The sanctification of the day jumped up and stood before Him. Thus, the Good Side appeared before the Other Side appeared, and the world was established. So instead of the Other Side becoming strong and establishing itself in the world, as it planned, the Good Side was established and grew strong on that night by the construction of holy bodies and the forming of holy spirits from that Side. Therefore, the sages who know this perform their conjugal rights weekly, on Shabbat eve."
            ],
            [
                "",
                "2. Because when the Other Side saw this - that just as he planned on doing, the Side of Holiness preceded it, then the Other Side went along to wander about, together with all its hosts and legions to watch over those who perform their conjugal rights naked and by the light of the candle. Because of this, all their children born from that intercourse are born epileptic, because they are possessed by spirits that come from the Other Side. And these are the naked spirits of the wicked that are called demons. These are pursued and killed by Lilit.",
                "3. So, because the day was sanctified, and holiness ruled over the world, the Other Side makes itself small and hides during every Shabbat Eve and during every Shabbat Day. Only Asimon and his group do not hide, but go around floating above the candlelight secretly in order to observe the indecent intercourse. And after that they go and hide inside the cave of the great abyss. As soon as Shabbat is over, many hosts and legions roam about in the world. This is why the hymn against calamities, (Psalms 91), was composed - to prevent them from ruling over the holy nation. Where do they roam to on that night? When they come out in haste and think that they are about to rule over the world and overcome the holy nation, they see them standing in prayer and reciting this hymn (Ps. 91), saying the Havdalah during the prayers and then performing the Havdalah with the cup. Then they fly from there and go roaming until they reach the desert. May the Merciful One save us from them and from the Evil Side.",

The first is he who curses himself; the second is he who throws away bread or bread crumbs as big as an olive; and the third is he who lights the candle when the Shabbat is over before Yisrael reached the recital of Sanctification, that is during Ve'Ata Kadosh. Because with that fire, he lights the flames of Gehenom before its time. There is a special place in Gehenom for those who profane the Shabbat. Those who are punished in Gehenom curse the person who lit the candle before its time, and they say to him, \"Behold; Hashem will thrust you about with a mighty throw, and He will seize you firmly. He will violently roll and toss you like a ball into a large country\" (Isaiah 22:17-18).",
                "5. It is not proper for him to light the candle, as Shabbat is not over before Yisrael recite the prayer of Havdalah and say the benediction over the cup (of wine). For until that time, it is still Shabbat, and the sanctity of the Shabbat still rests upon us. So after the benediction over the cup is performed, all those hosts and legions that govern the weekdays return to their positions, each one according to the appointed service for which he is responsible.",
                "6. Because as soon as the Shabbat begins and the day is sanctified, holiness is aroused and governs the world; worldliness is removed from its rule. Only when Shabbat is over do they regain their position again. But although Shabbat is over, they do not regain their positions until that moment when Yisrael say in the land of Yisrael, \"Blessed are You, Hashem, who separate the holy from the secular.\" Then the holiness is removed, and all the hosts that govern the weekdays are aroused and return to their positions, each one according to its post for which it is responsible. Nevertheless, they do not receive control until the flames of the candle are lit. All these flames are called the Lights of Fire because they all come from the secret behind the column of fire and the element of fire, and they take charge over the lower world. All this happens if a person lights the candle before Yisrael have finished the recital of the sanctification.",
                "7. And if he waits until they complete the sanctification, all those wicked people who are in Gehenom acknowledge the justice brought upon them by the Holy One, blessed be He. And they confirm the blessings that are recited by the congregation, and bring them upon him. \"Therefore Hashem gives you of the dew of heaven\" (Genesis 27:28), and \"Blessed shall you be in the field...\" (Deuteronomy 28:3). \"Blessed is he who considers the poor; Hashem will deliver him in the day of evil\" (Psalms 41:2). As it should have been written 'in the day of evil' [masc. adj.], so why does it say, \"in the day of evil [fem. adj.]?\" This refers to the day when that Evil [fem. adj.] is in power and wants to take his soul away from him. \"Blessed is he who considers the poor.\" The words, \"the poor\" allude to a very ill person; \"That considers\" alludes to how to cure him from his sins as he stands before the Holy One, blessed be He. Another meaning is that this is the day when Judgment prevails and is about to dominate the world, and he \"Considers\" to be saved from it. As it has been written: \"Hashem will deliver him in the day of evil -\" so too the day when Judgment is passed over to the Evil in order to control the world. (End):"

The place where at first there was only filth, has become now a nest of refuse that is described as without form. It went through four stages until it became Tohu: (1) light turned into water; (2) water turned into snow; (3) snow turned into refuse with the infliction of the fire; and (4) the refuse, over time, became sufficiently distinguishable to be called without form.

In other words, darkness does not mean only the absence of light that is, emptiness but rather the aspect that produces emptiness, like a strong fire that burns and consumes everything it touches and leaves emptiness in its place.

The expansion of this light that appears in the verse: \"Let there be light (Heb. אוֹר, Aleph-Vav -Resh)\" is a most hidden secret, because it was the expansion that split according to the secret of the concealment of the supernal and concealed air (Heb. אֲוִיר).

The light has gone; it has disappeared and is now hidden. And one point remains in Binah, where the light of Chochmah always reaches in a hidden manner.

                "24. \"And Elohim called...\", etc. (Genesis 1:5). He asks: What is the meaning of \"And Elohim called the light day\"? He replies, This means that he called and invited it to bring forth from within that perfect light that stands in the middle, referring to Tiferet, one light. And this light is the foundation of the world, upon which all worlds are erected and from where all the souls are born. From this perfected light emerges the central pillar, the foundation of the life of the worlds, this being the day from the right side. The words: \"And the darkness he called night\" mean that He called and invited it, bringing forth one female from within the left side, the secret of darkness. This female principle is the secret of the moon that governs at night. For this reason, it is called night. And this is the secret of the name \"Adonai\" and the name \"the Master of all the earth\" (Joshua 3:11). The right enters into that perfected pillar in the middle, where it is included with the secret of the left; namely, Chesed of Zeir Anpin, which also includes"

                "1. His Gvurah and enters His Central Column, which is Tiferet. Then Zeir Anpin rises up to the primal point, which is Arich Anpin, and takes and possesses there, in Arich Anpin, Mochin, which are a thing based on the secret of the three vowels Cholam, Shuruk and Chirik which are called holy seed. For no seed can be sown for the purpose of the Mochin except according to this secret. All, referring to the illumination of the three vowels, were united in the central pillar, which is Tiferet, and it emanated the foundation (Yesod) of the world. Because of this, Yesod is called all, because it holds on to all, namely the illumination of all three Columns by the light of passion. In other words, because of the desire of the Left for the light of the Right, Yesod reconciles the Left with the Right and unites them. And because the Central Column acquires them, that Column attains both of them and bestows them both on Yesod.",
                "2. The left is set ablaze by the force of might, and smells. It smelled throughout the grades, and from the glow of this fire it emanates the Female principle called moon. This blazing is considered to be darkness, because it extends from darkness. And these two sides, the right and the left, produce these two grades, one male and one female, because Yesod, which is male, emanated from the rule of the Right of Zeir Anpin. The Female principle emanates from the Left Column of Zeir Anpin. Yesod holds on to the central pillar and receives the additional light that was in it. This refers to the light of Chochmah, which is an additional light for Zeir Anpin. The central pillar, Zeir Anpin, is entirely complete by Chochmah and by Chassadim, because of the peace he brought to all sides. Thus, it has received additional light Mochin from above, namely from Arich Anpin which is Chochmah, and from all sides, namely from the right and left. From Its own Central Column, it has achieved Chassadim and Gvurot, and the joy of all the worlds is in It. This is the secret of the illumination of Chochmah that eliminates all the Klipot. And from this additional of gaiety, the foundation (Yesod) of the world issued and is called an addition. From here, Yesod, all the lower powers, spirits and holy souls of the righteous, come out according to the secret of the sacred names Yud Hei Vav Hei-Tzva'ot which means that He is a sign that appears in all his hosts. He is also called El the Elohim of the spirits, from whom all the spirits and souls of the righteous emanate.",
                "3. The night, Master of all Earth, is the Female principle. She emanates from the left side, from that darkness. Because the entire desire of that darkness was to be included within the Right Column and receive light, its power was weakened. When night began to expand from the left before its structure was completed, the darkness namely the Left Column entered and merged with the Right Column, and the Right held on to it. Night then was left lacking at its end, because its source, which is the Left Column, disappeared in the Right Column and did not help it reach completion. So now there are two things lacking in the Female principle: (1) the aspect of the night, meaning darkness instead of light, and (2) her structure was not completed by the left. Just as darkness, which is the left, desires to be included within the light of the Right Column, so the Female principle, which is night, desires to be included within day. Darkness, which is the Left Column, abated its light because it had not yet completed the structure of the Female principle. Because of this, it produced the grade of the female with an incomplete structure and without light, namely with the two aforementioned defects. Therefore, the Female principle required two reforms: (1) to bring her light and free her from her darkness and (2) to complete her structure. Darkness, the Left Column, cannot illuminate unless it merges with the light of the right. And the same applies to the night, which is constructed in the left and emerges from it. It does not show any light unless it merges with the day, Yesod. The defect of the structure of the night is not completed until the Musaf (additional prayer), which is the additional light that Yesod has received from the Central Column namely, the excessive illumination of Chochmah in Zeir Anpin. And this additional light completes the structure of the Female principle. So what was added to one place is diminished in another. This means that what was added to the Sefirah of Yesod of Zeir Anpin by the Central Column, the Left Column of Zeir Anpin, has caused a diminution and lack in the Female principle. But Yesod fills up this lack with its additional light.",
                "4. The Musaf, which is Yesod of Zeir Anpin, contains the secret of the supernal point, which is Arich Anpin, and the secret of the central pillar, which is Tiferet of Zeir Anpin that reconciles all sides. Because of this, two letters were added to Yesod, which are Vav and Yud, in the phrase: \"And Elohim called (Heb. vayikra) the light day\" (Genesis 1:5), in which the letter Vav alludes to the light of Chassadim that it received from the Central Column and the Yud to the light of Chochmah that it received from Arich Anpin. In the emanation on the Female principle, which is night, these two letters were missing. So of her it is written קָרָא, without the Vav and Yud. Of the Day, which is Yesod, it is written וַיִּקְרָא. He subtracted, in the Female principle, the letters Vav and Yud from vayikra, and so it is written of her only \"he called (kara) night.\" Here lies the secret of the name with the 72 letters that are inscribed in the supernal crown - referring to the secret of the letters Vav and Yud.",
                "5. \"And Elohim said, 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters'\" (Genesis 1:6). This phrase alludes to a detailed reform of the separation of the upper from the lower waters according to the secret of the left. Here, the dispute according to the secret of the left occurred. Until this point, referring to the first day, reference is made to the right. But on the second day, reference is to the secret of the governing of the left. Because of this, a great dispute broke out on the second day between the two sides. The left wanted to cancel the governing power of the right entirely, while the right wanted to cancel the governing power of the left entirely. The right, which is the secret of Chesed and the first day, is the perfection of all. Because of this, everything was written in the right on the first day. This means that all the seven days, which are the seven Sefirot, emerged in it and are hinted in it, because every perfection depends on the right side. When the rule of the left was aroused, its dispute with the right began and the fire of anger in that dispute became fierce. From this dispute, Gehenom was created. So Gehenom was awakened, and created by the left, and cleaved to it, which means that whoever wants to strengthen the left shall fall into Gehenom, which originates from it.",
                "6. In his wisdom, Moses looked into this and learned about the work of Creation. In the work of Creation, there was a dispute between the left and the right. And in that dispute, which the left provoked, Gehenom was created and Gehenom held on to the left. The central pillar, which is Tiferet, entered between them on the third day, ending the dispute and bringing the two sides to an agreement. So Gehenom removed itself from the left and descended below. The left joined the right, and there was peace everywhere.",
                "7. A similar dispute occurred between Korah and Aaron, the left against the right. Moses studied the Creation and said, 'I am one able to eliminate the dispute between right and left.' Moses tried his best to reconcile them, but the left did not want to be reconciled. So Korah become stronger and overcame Aaron. Moses said, assuredly, because of the power of the disagreement of the left, Gehenom should cling to it, just as it was in the works of Creation. Korah did not wish to be attached above, namely to the structure of holiness, and join the right, like the left on high. So assuredly, he shall descend below, down into Gehenom, because of the fierceness of his anger. As happened in the works of Creation, Gehenom came out and cleaved to the left. Moses knew that with the strength of Korah's anger, Korah would descend to Gehenom and be attached to it.",
                "8. Because of this, Korah did not want Moses to settle this dispute, since it was not for heaven's sake (with pure intentions). He had no respect for the celestial glory, which is the Shechinah, and refused to acknowledge the work of Creation. This means that he denied the settlement of the Central Column. in the work of Creation. He wanted only the left to govern. As soon as Moses realized that he was denying the work of Creation and being rejected out of holiness, \"Moses was much angered\" (Numbers 16:15).",
                "9. \"And Moses was much angered,\"because Korah and his company refused to acknowledge him and did not allow him to settle the dispute. It is written \"much,\" because they denied the acknowledgment of the work of Creation. So Korah denied "
            ],
            [
                "1. Korah denied everything above in Zeir Anpin and below in the souls, as it is written: \"When they strove against Hashem\" (Numbers 26:9) which is the secret of Zeir Anpin, for the damage that he did reached both above to Zeir Anpin and below to Moses. Therefore, Korah cleaved on to what he deserved; he reached Gehenom, as written, \"They went down alive into Sheol\" (Numbers 16:33). ",
                "2. Another dispute was settled like above. A dispute that rose and did not come down and was based on decency was that between Shammai and Hillel. Shammai was the aspect of the left on high, while Hillel was the aspect of the supernal right. And the Holy One, blessed be He, intervened between them and approved of them. This means that the differences and arguments between Shammai and Hillel reached them from the Central Column of above, which is the secret of the Holy One, blessed be He. This was a dispute for the sake (name) of heaven, and the heavens, Zeir Anpin, reconciled this dispute to establish both. Because of this, their illuminations continue to exist. This dispute is like the work of Creation. It is similar to what the Central Column achieved for the sake of establishing the work of Creation. But Korah denied the establishing of the work of Creation and the dispute was toward the heavens, namely Zeir Anpin, that is, the reconciling Column. And he wanted to deny the principles of the Torah, which is Zeir Anpin. Assuredly this dispute and denial was the result of the efforts of Gehenom, and its power of Judgment cleaved to Korah and he to it. Thus, he fell into Gehenom.",
                "3. This secret appears in the Book of Adam. When darkness was aroused to take control, it emerged in all its might and created Gehenom within it, and Gehenom cleaved to it in that dispute. As the anger and the might of the Gevurot were calmed down, the dispute was aroused in a different manner, as a dispute of love. There were two kinds of disputes: One at the beginning and one at the end. This is the path of the righteous, which is hard in the beginning, because it is full of suffering, but ends in peace. Korah, being the left, was the beginning of the dispute between the right and the left, which was full of anger and fierceness. Each wanted to diminish the illumination of its neighbor. From this, Gehenom emerged and Korah cleaved to Gehenom. Shammai was also the aspect of the left, but at the end of the dispute between the right and the left, when anger was forgotten and the dispute of love was set in motion so as to receive approval from the heavens, which is the Column that settles the dispute.",
                "4. This is the secret of the verse: \"Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide...\" (Genesis 1:6) This is the first dispute, aroused by anger and force, in which each wanted to overcome and annul its neighbor. The Holy One, blessed be He, wished to nullify the dispute and Gehenom was aroused until the anger and aggressiveness cooled down. Then it is written: \"And Elohim made the firmament and divided...\" (Ibid. 7). This division is the dispute, carried with love and friendship, which supports the world. According to this secret, (namely through the dispute of love) is carried the dispute between Shammai and Hillel namely the dividing of \"And Elohim made the firmament\" at the end of the dispute. On the other hand, the dispute of Korah was one of anger which is the dividing of \"Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters\" at the beginning of the dispute. So the dispute of Shammai and Hillel was for the sake of heaven, in which the Oral Torah, which is the secret of the Female principle, entered with love into the Written Torah, which is Zeir Anpin and called heaven. And they were in perfect union.",
                "5. Division certainly applies to the left alone, as is written in relation to the second day: \"And let it divide.\" (Ibid. 6) While of Korah, it is written: \"Is it but a small thing to you, that the Elohim of Yisrael has separated you\" (Numbers 16:9). It is also written: \"At that time Hashem separated the tribe of Levi\" (Deuteronomy 10:8). So, assuredly the separation appears only in the second day in the place of the left. You may ask: If division occurs definitely on the second day, why then is the separation mentioned about Levi, who is the third son of Jacob? It should have been associated with Simon, who is the second son of Jacob. The answer is that although Levi is the third son, according to Jacob's mind he is the second, because Reuben is not considered the first son of Leah, as at the time Jacob thought she was Rachel. So the separation is forever in the second, because after the division has occurred in the second, everything goes smoothly along the straight path in a perfect way, as it should be. This is because by the separation, the lights enclothe each other and are completed by each other.",
                "6. The Havdalah (prayer of separation) that is performed at the end of Shabbat is for the purpose of separating those powers that are dominant during the days of the week from holiness that is dominant during Shabbat. With the ending of Shabbat, one aspect of Gehenom appears. It is the evil eye that desires to govern the world, just as Yisrael recite, \"O Prosper it, the work of our hands\" (Psalms 90:17). It emerges from that grade of the Other Side, which is called the left, and wishes to mingle with the seed of Yisrael by taking control over the holy covenant and having power to punish Yisrael.",
                "7. While Yisrael perform an action, a precept, using the myrtle and the wine and recite the Havdalah, the Other Side departs from them. That side is lowered and enters into its place in Sheol, in the place where Korah and his company are, as it is written: \"They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol\" (Numbers 16:33). So Korah and his company did not go down to Gehenom until Yisrael separated from them, as it is written: \"Separate yourselves from among this congregation\" (Ibid. 21). Here as well, the Other Side does not go to Gehenom at the ending of Shabbat before Yisrael performs the Havdalah.",
                "8. So the separation (Heb. הַבְדָּלָה) is always on the second day, which is the Left Column. This refers to what has already been explained, that even the Havdalah at the ending of Shabbat is intended to separate the Other Side that extends from the Left Column. It was at the beginning of the dispute, which was aroused by the aggressiveness and anger of the left before it was calmed down and quieted, that Gehenom was created. Then were created all these angels that denounce before the Holy One, blessed be He, their Master, above, the secret of the Central Column. They disagree with his reconciliation and deviate to the left. Therefore, fire burns them up and they are consumed. And the other angels, all those who are annulled and have no support, are burned in the fire. All these have come from the power of the fire of the dispute in the beginning, on the second day. Similarly, Korah fell down into Gehenom and burned, just like those angels who burned in the fire of Nahar Dinur (Eng. 'River of Fire'). And everything follows the same manner, extending from the beginning of this dispute with the fire of anger.",
                "9. \"Let there be a firmament\" tells us that an expansion has occurred between the two. The lower waters expanded and were separated from the upper waters, and the upper waters expanded and were separated from the lower waters by the firmament. The letters El (Aleph-Lamed) in the name Elohim (Aleph-Lamed-Hei-Yud-Mem) from the firmament up are of the right part. In other words, El always alludes to the name of Chesed, which is the right side. The name great El has expanded from within the waters and is separated from them. This means that because of the firmament, the name great El has spread upward and has separated itself from the other waters, namely the three letters Hei-Yud-Mem. This was to complete the name El and to include the upper and lower waters within each other through that expansion. And the name El of Elohim expanded, leaving only the three letters Hei-Yud-Mem. Hei-Yud-Mem then expanded down below the firmament and became the lower waters, Yud-Mem-Hei. This is the expansion into the second one, that is, Hei- Yud-Mem into Yud-Mem-Hei. The upper waters are Hei-Yud -Mem, as written, \"So is this great and wide sea (Heb. hayam, Hei-Yud-Mem)\" (Tehilim 104:25). Thus, Hei Yud Mem are the upper waters. If the letters Hei-Yud-Mem are in reversed order, that is, Yud-Mem-Hei, this indicates they are lower waters. Once the letters Yud-Mem-Hei were restored, they ascended and rose above the firmament and joined the name Great El and returned to the combination of the great sea (Heb. hayam), which was Hei-Yud-Mem. Then everyone, El and Hei-Yud-Mem were united as one, resulting in one name Elohim. And this name Elohim reached into many places.",
                "10. The upper waters are male; the lower waters are female. At first, before they were firmly established, they were mixed, but were later separated to distinguish the upper waters from the lower waters. And to differentiate them, one is called Elohim, which is Binah, and the other is called Adonai, which is Malchut. One is the upper Hei of the name Yud Hei Vav Hei, which is Binah, and the other is the lower Hei of the name Yud Hei Vav Hei, which is Malchut. It is then written about them: \"And Elohim made the firmament\" (Genesis 1:7). This expansion assumed the name Elohim, for the verse: \"And Elohim made\" indicates that the expansion of Hei-Yud-Mem returned back to El and merged into the name Elohim and the upper waters. For the name Elohim is the upper waters"
            ],
            [
                "1. and the name Adonai, the Female principle of Zeir Anpin, is the female waters. Nevertheless, since the male waters, or the letters Hei-Yud-Mem, were completed only by the female waters {namely, the Female principle of Zeir Anpin} the name Elohim expanded everywhere, {including the female waters.}",
                "2. Although on the second day, the upper and lower waters were divided, the dispute between the right and the left, {which are the letters Aleph-Lamed and Hei-Yud-Mem}, did not cease until the third day, {which is Tiferet}. The third day settled the dispute between the right and the left, as the two Columns Aleph-Lamed and Hei-Yud-Mem enclothed each other, and both were established properly in their places. Because of this dispute, even though the world exists upon it, it is not written: \"it was good\" about the second day, because the work was not yet completed on that day. So the upper and lower waters were mingled together as one, and there was no offspring in the world until they were divided in two and distinguished as separate from each other. Only then did they bring forth offspring.",
                "3. Although the separation of the lower waters from the upper waters occurred on the second day, the dispute between El, which is the Right, and Hei-Yud-Mem, which is the Left, was unresolved. Only the third day reconciled between them. Both became equal and joined them into the one name Elohim. The third day, which is Zeir Anpin, is the name, upon which is engraved Hei-Vav-Hei, to make the upper waters, Binah, equal to the lower waters, Malchut. Because the letters Hei-Vav-Hei are the secret of the two Heis with Vav between them: the upper Hei is Binah, and the lower Hei is Malchut. The Vav in between is Zeir Anpin and it completes and illuminates both sides, above in Binah and below in Malchut. This was signified by the splitting of the waters of the Jordan, where the upper waters rose in a heap and did not flow down into the Dead Sea. This is the secret of the upper Hei of the name Yud Hei Vav Hei, namely Binah. On the other hand, the lower waters which are the secret of the lower Hei, Malchut flowed down into the Dead Sea which is the secret of the lower Hei, Malchut. And Yisrael, the secret of the letter Vav, went in the middle between the upper waters and the lower waters of the Jordan. Thus Yisrael, the secret of the Vav of Yud Hei Vav Hei, received the abundance from the upper Hei and bestowed it upon the lower Hei.",
                "4. Firmament is mentioned five times on the second day, and the life of the worlds, which is Yesod of Zeir Anpin, passes through them and guides the worlds through them. They all are comprised of each other. Had the Central Column not settled the dispute, neither would have included the other nor be harmonized. These five firmaments are equivalent to the 500 years to which the Tree of Life, which is Zeir Anpin, is attached to produce offspring and fruits in the world. All the waters of Creation, namely the kinds of Mochin that flow out from Beresheet, which is Arich Anpin, are divided under it and through it into the upper waters and the lower waters. King David, who is the secret of the Female principle, receives everything from Zeir Anpin. He then distributes it down to the lower worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, as it is written: \"And he distributed among all the people, among the whole multitude\" (II Samuel 6:19). It is also written: \"You give it to them; they gather it\" (Psalms 104:28) and \"She rises also while it is yet night, and gives food\" (Proverbs 31:15).",
                "5. When disagreement was aroused through the fierceness of the left, the mist of fire increased and became overpowering. The spirits produced from within that mist immediately congealed; they became dry and without any moisture. These spirits, which were male and female, produced a multitude of evil spirits. From this, all the might of the impure spirit appeared in all those strong spirits. This is the secret of the Kelipah of the foreskin. These spirits were strengthened in impurity through the violent demons. One is called a viper and the other a serpent, and these two kinds become one. The viper bears offspring every seventy years, while the serpent only every seven years. But as they are joined together, everything returned to the seven years of the serpent. Therefore, the viper begets every seven years like the serpent, and they become as if one species.",
                "6. From here lies the secret of Gehenom, which has seven names, and the Evil Inclination, which also has seven names. From here, impurity expands and spreads out in many grades into the world. And everything comes from the principle of the left, which contains good and evil and thereby, makes the world habitable. From here is the secret of the Holy Name that is engraved by eighteen letters and is responsible for the bountiful rains that feed the earth, for human charity, for all our blessings, and for the general inhabitation of this world.",
                "7. \"And Elohim said, 'Let the waters...be gathered'\" (Genesis 1:9). The words \"be gathered (Heb. yikavu)\" mean that the Mochin called the waters will travel in a straight line (Heb. קַו) on one level, without spreading to the right or left. Everything flows mysteriously from the secret of that primal point, which is Arich Anpin, until the light reaches and is gathered in the supernal chamber. From there it then flows in a straight line to the other grades, namely to Zeir Anpin, until it reaches that one place where everything is gathered according to the secret of male and female. He asks: And what is that place? He replied: This is the life of the worlds {<i>namely Yesod of Zeir Anpin, which is the male who is united with Malchut, which is the Female principle. Thus, it comprises male and female together.</i>}",
                "8. The waters mentioned in the verse flow from above, {from the upper Hei of the Yud Hei Vav Hei, which is Yisrael Saba and Tevunah.} The words \"under the heaven\" allude to small Vav, <i>which is Yesod of Zeir Anpin. Zeir Anpin is called great Vav, while his Yesod is called small Vav.</i> Therefore, when the letter Vav is pronounced, two Vav's are heard. The first one is heaven, <i>namely Zeir Anpin</i>, and the second one is under the heaven, <i>namely Yesod of Zeir Anpin. After the Mochin are drawn from the upper Hei which is Binah down under the heaven which is Yesod of Zeir Anpin it is written:</i> \"And let the dry land appear\" (Ibid.). This is the lower Hei <i>namely Malchut</i>, the Female principle <i>of Zeir Anpin because only she was revealed as dry land</i>, while all the other grades were hidden. From within that last grade, <i>referring to the lower Hei, Malchut, </i>that light that was concealed was heard and revealed.",
                "9. The phrase \"to one place\" is called Yesod because there is a connection to the union of the upper world through Yesod. The verse: \"Hashem shall be one, and His Name One\" (Zechariah 14:9) hints at two unions. One is the upper world that is unified in its own grades, which is the secret of: \"Hashem is one\" and the second is the lower world that is unified in its own grades, according to the secret: \"And His Name One.\" The unification of the upper world by the secret of \"Hashem is one\" is up to Yesod. The life of the worlds, which is Yesod, is sweetened in Binah, and the upper world is connected to its unification. Because of this, it is called: \"to one place,\" as all the grades and all the parts, gather there. And they become as one in it, without any separation at all. No grade unites there wholly save this grade, in which all the lights are mysteriously covered in one desire. Up to this point, referring to the words: \"And let the dry land appear,\" the revealed world which is the secret of Rachel is unified with the concealed world which is Leah.",
                "10.The revealed world, <i>which is Rachel, the Female principle of Zeir Anpin</i> who is located from his Chest downward, is similarly unified below. The revealed world is the lower world, <i>as can be proven by reading the scriptures, where it is described in terms of seeing:</i> \"I saw Hashem\" (Isaiah 6:1), \"and they saw the Elohim of Yisrael\" (Exodus 24:10), \"and the glory of Hashem appeared (Numbers 14:10) and \"As the appearance of the rainbow...so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Hashem\" (Ezekiel 1:28). And it is known that the lower Female principle, <i>who is called Rachel, </i>is described by the words: \"Glory of Hashem\" and by the particle Et (the). This is the secret of the verse: \"Let the dry land appear (lit. 'be seen'),\" <i>because \"seeing\" applies only to the revealed world and not to the upper world.</i> The verse: \"As the appearance of the rainbow,\" which is written about the divine Chariot of Yechezkel, alludes to the life of the worlds, namely Yesod of Zeir Anpin. Therefore, it is written in the portion of Noah: \"I have set My rainbow in the cloud\" (Genesis 9:13), which also alludes to Yesod of Zeir Anpin, who is called the life of the worlds. The phrase \"in the cloud\" refers to Malchut; namely, the lower Female principle of Zeir Anpin, the revealed world of Rachel. The words \"I have set\" mean that he has set his rainbow in the cloud ever since the day of Creation. "

That cloudy day, which is described in the verse: \"And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud\" (Ibid. 14)<i> indicates that only then shall the rainbow be seen according to the secret of </i>\"the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Hashem,\" <i>and not at any other time. Why is this so?</i> As the left is aroused, Rachel emerges to her own aspect \"and she had hard labor\" (Genesis 35:16). <i>Therefore it is said that three angels stay by her side: </i>Michael at one side, {the right side}; Raphael at one side, {in the middle}; and Gabriel at one side, {the left side}. And from them she receives her strength to give birth. These three aspects are the colors seen in the form of the rainbow: white, red and green.",
                "2. The phrase \"so was the appearance of the brightness round about\" alludes to the illumination that was concealed and has disappeared within the pupil of the eye. So the phrase: \"This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Hashem\" applies to the colors in the \"appearance of the rainbow\" and not to \"the appearance of the brightness.\" This is because the lower union of the three colors of the rainbow corresponds with the upper union. The three names \"Hashem our Elohim; Hashem,\" which appear in the verse: \"Hear, O Yisrael\" (Devarim 6:4) allude to the three colors, white, red, and green when they are concealed, invisible, and attached to one place. This is the secret of the first union in the upper world that is called one place. And the colors united in the rainbow below which are white, red and green correspond to the three concealed colors of the upper union: Hashem our Elohim Hashem. These colors of the rainbow belong to another union, which is the secret of: \"And his Name One,\" the lower union. It is the secret of the verse: 'Blessed be the Name of the glory of His Kingdom for ever and ever (Heb. baruch shem kevod...),' that we respond after \"Hear, O Yisrael,\" which is the lower union. The upper union indicated by the verse: \"Hear, O Yisrael, Hashem our Elohim; Hashem is One\" corresponds to the lower union: 'Blessed be the name of the Glory of his Kingdom for ever and ever.' Each verse contains six words.",
                "3. The words \"be gathered\" suggest measurement by the line and the measuring; measuring is from the hard spark that is in Binah, as it is written: \"Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand\" (Isaiah 40:12). In this verse, \"who\" alludes to Binah. This is what is meant by: \"Let the waters...be gathered.\" Here in the verse: \"Let the waters...be gathered\" is the extent of the entire Mochin of He who forms the worlds, namely Zeir Anpin, and which is hinted at in the name Yud Hei Vav Hei, fully spelled with Aleph's, as Yud-Vav-Dalet, Hei-Aleph, Vav-Aleph-Vav, Hei-Aleph. \"Holy, holy, holy\" (Isaiah 6:3) is the secret of the Mochin of Binah, which is also the secret of the verse: \"Let the waters...be gathered.\" The phrase \"Hashem Tzva'ot\" (Ibid.) is the secret of the verse: \"to one place,\" Yesod of Zeir Anpin that is called the life of the worlds, to which the Mochin from Binah flow according to the secret of the phrase: \"to one place.\" The phrase: \"The whole earth is full of his glory\" (Ibid.) is the secret of the verse: \"and let the dry land appear.\" This verse is the secret of the lower Hei, called the revealed world when comprised within the union of the upper world. The words \"and let the dry land appear\"is the secret of the engraved name of the union of Caf -Vav-Zayin-Vav, Bet-Mem-Vav-Caf-Samech-Zayin and Caf-Vav-Zayin-Vav, because the dry land which is the revealed world is included in the union of the supernal world which is the secret of \"Hashem our Elohim; Hashem.\"",
                "4. The verse: \"Let the earth bring forth grass\" (Genesis 1:11) is the secret of the lower union, as it is now revealing its powers in these waters that have been gathered in one place. The Mochin are drawn down into it in a concealed and a hidden manner. And from within it come forth supernal and concealed souls and holy hosts. These are formed and drawn, using the edifices of Faith, by the righteous, the men of Faith - namely the female waters  - by worshipping their Master.",
                "5. This is the secret of the verse: \"Who causes the grass to grow for the cattle\" (Tehilim 104:14). This is the living creature that crouches on a thousand mountains and for whom grass is grown every day. This grass refers to those angels who govern only for a specific time, but then must vanish immediately; because they were created on the second day, their dominion draws upon the Left Column that was created on the second day. In their dominion they wish to annul the right. They are destined to be food for this living creature, which means that nothing of their illumination is drawn down to the lower beings. Only the Female principle enjoys it, and then she burns and annuls them with it as there is fire that consumes fire, which is the dominion of the Left, called 'fire.'",
                "6. In the verse: \"And plants for the service of man\" (Ibid.), the word \"plants\" refers to wheels, holy living creatures and Cherubs. The wheels (Heb. Ofanim) are the angels of Asiyah, the holy living creatures are the angels of Yetzirah and the Cherubs are the angels of Briyah. All of these are made ready and clothed by the Creator Himself. However, they are further prepared when people worship their Master with sacrifices and prayer. This is what is meant by \"the service of man.\" The plants were predestined and prepared for \"the service of man\" and will be further perfected by that service, as it should be. When they are made ready by \"the service of man,\" sustenance and food come from them to the world, as it is written: \"That he may bring forth food out of the earth\" (Idid.). This is what is meant: \"herb yielding seed\" (Gen. 1:12), which is the secret of the Mochin. The grass (hay) does not yield any seed, but is intended to be consumed by the sacred fire of the Female principle, as explained above, whereas the herb, which yields seed, is intended for the improvement of the world.",
                "7. All this is to \"bring forth food out of the earth,\" because all the improvements given to people are only for the purpose of establishing this herb out of the earth, which is the Female principle. Thus, people's service to their Master is designed to supply sustenance and food from out of the earth to this world, so that people will be blessed from above. The verse: \"And fruit tree yielding fruit\" (Gen. 1:11) alludes to two grades: one grade above another, which represents male and female. This means that the fruit tree is the Female principle of Zeir Anpin; \"yielding fruit\" alludes to Yesod of Zeir Anpin, which is male. It is said to be \"yielding fruit\" because all the fruit that the female yields reaches her from the male. Just as the \"fruit tree,\" which is the Female principle, reveals the potential power that it received from the \"fruit tree yielding fruit,\" which is the male, so it reveals her own potential as well. What is revealed from the potential of the Female principle herself?  The Cherubs and pillars are revealed from her own aspect. What are these pillars?  They are those that rise up in the smoke of the sacrifice and become stronger because of the offering. They are called \"columns of smoke.\" This is the secret of the verse: \"Who is this coming out of the wilderness like columns of smoke\" (Song of Songs 3:6). So the Cherubs are the secret of the \"herb\" that she receives from the male and the \"columns of smoke\" are the \"grass.\" The Cherubs and pillars exist for \"the service of men,\" but not the \"grass,\" which is meant for food, as it is written: \"Behold now animals (Heb. בְּהֵמוֹת), which I made with you; he eats grass like an ox\" (Job 40:15). \"And fruit tree yielding fruit\" alludes to the forms of the male and female, and \"as for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man\" (Ezekiel 1:10). The \"fruit tree\" is the Female principle of Zeir Anpin and \"yielding fruit\" is Yesod of Zeir Anpin, the male that puts the fruit inside her. The male and female are not like the Cherubs, which are hinted at in the phrase: \"herb yielding seed.\" The male and female have large faces with beards, whereas the Cherubs have small faces like those of babies. The face of man contains all the images, including the lion, the ox and the eagle, since they have large faces. The engraved images are imprinted on this large face just as the engravings of the Holy Name are imprinted in the four directions of the world: East, West, North and South.",
                "8. Michael made a mark on the South side. And all three other faces gaze toward the face of a man - the face of a lion, the face of an ox and the face of an eagle. Michael is one of the four angels who serve the Female principle of Zeir Anpin. Therefore, he prepares the place for the mating. Because since he is the angel of Chesed, he sketches the imprint to the south, which is to the right. Man is male and female, and he is not called man unless both are included. This means that Malchut on her own, when she is not mating with Zeir Anpin, is not called man; only when they are united are they called man. This is the secret of the verse: \"male and female He created them; and blessed them, and called their name man\" (Gen. 5:2). So accordingly, they were together called man, but each one alone is only half a body and cannot be called man. The figures of the Chariot of Elohim are formed according to His image, namely from the face of a man, united on the south side, as it is written: \"The Chariots of Elohim are twice ten thousand, thousand upon thousands (Heb. שִׁנְאָן)\" (Ps. 68:18). This is the secret of the lower Chariot that is called the Chariot of Elohim.",
                "9. The word שִׁנְאָן consists of the letters Shin-Nun-Aleph-Nun. Written in the scriptural verse, it includes all the images all the living creatures, which include the ox (Heb. shor), the eagle (Heb. nesher) and the lion (Heb. aryeh). For the initials of these words form the Shin-Nun-Aleph of שִׁנְאָן, and the final Nun in the word שִׁנְאָן alludes to the face of a man"
            ],
            [
                "1. that is included with them. This final Nun is the secret of the expansion of male and female that are united as one. Everyone in the worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, emerges from these living creatures, which are the secret of Shin'an. From them, the forms of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah are born and separated, each befitting its aspect.",
                "2. These living creatures are joined one to the other, so that each includes all the others. The ox, eagle, lion and man are directed by the secret of the four engraved names, which are \"a great El, a mighty, and a terrible\" (Devarim 10:17), to which they ascend to behold them.",
                "3. The ox ascended to be guided by and gaze on the face of a man. With the ox rose one name that was crowned and engraved by the secret of the two colors, which represent the name El. After the ox was included in the name El, it turned back and the throne, which is the Female principle of Zeir Anpin, inscribed it, engraved it and received its imprint, so that it may be guided by the secret of the name El. Although the ox is of the left, it was nevertheless marked to be guided by the aspect of Chassadim in the name El.",
                "4. The eagle ascended to be guided and gaze on the face of a man. Another name rose up with it to be crowned and engraved according to the secret of the two faces, the face of man and the face of the eagle, and the two colors, the color of the right, which is white, and the color of the eagle, which is green so as to be guided and gaze on the crown above. The name of it is 'Great'. After this, the eagle returned and the throne, which is the Female principle, engraved and etched it. And the eagle was imprinted to be guided by the secret of this name; that is, for the attributes of the eagle are similar to those of the name Great.",
                "5. The lion ascended to be guided and gaze on the face of a man above. Another name rose up with it to be crowned and engraved by the secret of the two faces and the two colors, and to be strengthened and attached to Gevurah. This is the name 'Mighty'. Then it returned and the throne, which is the secret of the Female principle of Zeir Anpin, engraved and etched it and it was imprinted so as to be guided by the secret of this name, mighty. So that the attributes of the Lion, which is to the right, be like the attributes of the name mighty and the lion will be guided by the attribute of Gevurah.",
                "[The] human gazes at them all (ox, eagle, and lion), while all of them ascend and gaze at him. Then they all are traced in their engravings . . . in the mystery of one name called awesome/nora’. So it is written of them: “The likeness/d’mut of their faces was a human face” [Ez 1:10]. All of them include this image/d’yoqna, and this image includes them",
                "7. According to this secret, the Holy One, blessed be He, is called \"a great El, mighty and terrible.\" - הָאֵל הַגָּדוֹל הַגִּבּוֹר וְהַנּוֹרָא. These names are engraved above by the secret of the upper Chariot, which comprises four letters of the name Yud Hei Vav Hei, which is a name that includes all the other names. The combining of the lower ox within the upper lion is equivalent to the letter Yud of Yud Hei Vav Hei, and is the secret of the name El. The combining of the lower lion within the upper ox is equivalent to the letter Hei and is the secret of the name Mighty. The combining of the lower eagle within the upper lion is equivalent to the letter Vav and is the secret of the name Great. And the face of a man of above, which includes all the living creatures from below that have ascended to it, is equivalent to the lower Hei of Yud Hei Vav Hei and is the secret of the name Terrible. These images, the ox, eagle, lion and man, are engraved and carved on the throne, which is the Female principle of Zeir Anpin, and the throne is carved and decorated by them. And these likenesses were embroidered on the throne: one on the right, one on the left, one on the front and one on the back, thus corresponding to the four directions of the world. The face of the lion is imprinted on the right, which is the south wind; the face of the ox on the left, which is the north wind; the face of the eagle on the front, which is the east wind; and the face of a man on the back, which is the west wind. This is the secret of the four letters of Yud Hei Vav Hei.",
                "9. When the throne, which is the Female principle of Zeir Anpin, ascends to unite with Zeir Anpin, it is imprinted with these four images, ox, eagle, lion and man. These four supernal names carry the throne up to unite with Zeir Anpin. And the throne, namely the Female principle, becomes included within them during the union. This means that she is completed by and with these names. The throne collects and gleans, by its union with Zeir Anpin, souls and delightful pleasures. When it has collected and gleaned these delights and pleasures, it descends full, like a tree with branches on all sides and laden with fruit. As the throne descends from the place of union to its own place, the images of the four living creatures come forth, each shaped in its own form and engraving, illuminating, shining and radiating. They scatter seed over the world. Thus they are called the \"herb yielding seed\" and \"herb\" alludes to the living creatures that sow the world with seed.",
                "9. When the image of a man, which includes all the other images, issues forth, it is described as \"fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind\" (Gen. 1:11). Because man is both male and female, \"the fruit tree\" is the female and \"yielding fruit\" applies to the male. The phrase: \"Whose seed is in itself, upon the earth\" (Ibid.) teaches us that he emitted his seed for the benefit of the earth alone. So the phrase: \"Whose seed is in itself\" is purposely said to teach us that man should not emit his seed in vain. The \"herb\" which appears in the verse: \"Let the earth bring forth grass, herb yielding seed\" does not yield seed. Because of this, it has no permanency and does not last like the others. This is because it has no image to be shaped and engraved into any sort of likeness or form. Instead, they are seen and not seen. All those that have not been shaped into a form or an image have no permanency. They are created and last only for a certain time and are immediately consumed by the fire that devours fire, as already explained. Then they are again created and are immediately consumed by the fire that consumes fire. This is repeated again and again every day. A human being below, in this world has an image and a form, but he does not last forever, as do those of the angels above. The form and image of the angels above are formed in their shape without any other covering. Because of this, they are everlasting. The image of man in this world below referring to the Nefesh, Ruach and Neshamah is shaped into its form only by a covering. Because of this, man lasts only for a certain, limited period. Every night when a man sleeps, his spirit removes the covering and ascends. This fire that consumes fire, namely the Female principle of Zeir Anpin, consumes and burns this spirit. Later, the spirits are resurrected and reshaped in their coverings as before. Because of this, the spirits have no permanent existence, as do the images above, which is a reference to the angels of the \"herb,\" but are burned and then renewed as before. About this, it is written: \"They are new every morning\" (Lam. 3:23), which refers to the spirits of human beings, which are renewed daily."
            ],
            [
                "1. What is the purpose of this renewal? The verse concludes: \"Great is Your faithfulness\" (Ibid.), so it is great and not small.",
                "2. The phrase: \"Great is your faithfulness\" means that it is for certain that the faithfulness or Faith, which is the Female principle, is great. She is able to receive all the souls of the world and include them, the upper and the lower souls, in herself. The Female principle is a great and large space that includes everything and is never full. This is the secret of the verse: \"All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full\" (Kohelet 1:7). The Female principle is called the \"Sea\" and the \"rivers\" are the souls. So the verse actually means that all the souls flow into the Female principle, yet she is not full. And the reason she is not yet full is because the souls run into the sea, which receives them and burns them inside it. Because of this, the sea is not yet full. Afterward, the sea restores the souls to their former state and they come into this world. This is why the verse reads: \"Great is Your faithfulness.\"",
                "3. On this day, the third day, it is written twice, \"that it was good\" (Gen. 1:10, 12). This day is associated with two sides, the Right Column and the Left Column. It told each side \"that it was good,\" thereby reconciling the discord between them. This is why the phrase: \"And...said\" appears twice in it. Herein lies the secret of the name that is formed with the four letters, Yud Hei Vav Hei inscribed and engraved. These can add up to twelve letters that represent the four images on all four sides of the holy throne, which is the Female principle of Zeir Anpin.",
                "4. \"And Elohim said, 'Let there be luminaries (Heb. מְאוֹרוֹת)'\" (Gen. 1:14). The word מְאוֹרוֹת is written here with defective spelling, without the letter Vav. This means that the children's disease, croup (diphtheria), was created. Because without Vav, מְאוֹרוֹת means curses, as in the verse: \"The curse (Heb. me'erat) of Hashem is in the house of the wicked\" (Prov. 3:33). For after the illumination of the primordial light was concealed, the skull (Heb. Kelipah) of the brain was created. This Kelipah expanded and brought forth another Kelipah. As soon as the Kelipah went forth, it ascended and descended until it reached the small face. It wanted to cleave to it and become part of its form; it refused completely to be separated from it. When the Holy One, blessed be He, created Adam, he separated it from there and the Kelipah descended below to the level of Malchut only, in order to fix it in this world, on the level of Malchut alone and not above it.",
                "5. When the Kelipah saw Eve clinging to the side of Adam, who represented the beauty of above, and saw in them the complete form, it flew up from its place at the level of Malchut and wanted to cling to the small faces of Adam and Eve as before. However, the guards at the gates did not allow the Kelipah to cling to them. The Holy One, blessed be He, scolded it and cast it into the depths of the sea. The Kelipah sat there in the depth of the sea until Adam and his wife sinned. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, took the Kelipah out from the depths of the sea. It took control over all those babies, who are the small faces of people, who deserve punishment for the sins of their fathers. It wandered around the world, approached the gates of the terrestrial Garden of Eden, saw the Cherubs guarding the gates of the garden and sat down near the bright blade of the sword from which it had originally emerged.",
                "6. When the bright blade of the revolving sword changed to Judgment, the Kelipah fled and wandered around the world and found babies due to be punished. It is called the bright blade of a revolving sword, because it revolves and changes back and forth between Mercy and Judgment. The Kelipah laughed with the babies and then killed them. It did this during the waning of the moon, as its light diminished. This is why Me'orot (luminaries) is spelled without the letter Vav, which means curses. When Cain was born, the Kelipah was unable to cling to him, but later it approached him, cleaved to him and bore from him spirits and flying spirits.",
                "7. Adam had intercourse with female spirits for 130 years until Na'amah came. Because of her beauty, she led the sons of Elohim, Aza and Azael astray. She bore them all sorts of new kinds of Kelipah. Evil spirits and demons spread out from her into the world. They wander around the world during the night, deriding human beings and causing nocturnal pollution. Wherever they find men sleeping alone in their own homes, they hover over them and cling to them, arousing lustful desires and having offspring by them.",
                "8. When the moon is restored, the letters Mem-Aleph-Resh-Tav in the word Me'orot which means curses are turned into Aleph-Mem -Resh-Tav- אִמְרַת. This is according to the secret of the verse: \"The word of (Heb. אִמְרַת) Hashem is tried. He is a shield to all those who trust in Him\" (Ps. 18:31). He is a shield for all those who hold fast to their faith in the Holy One, blessed be He, against all those evil spirits and prosecutors who wander through the world at the time the light of the moon is diminishing.",
                "9. King Solomon penetrated the depth of the secret of the nut, as it is written: \"I went down into the garden of nuts\" (Shir Hashirim 6:11). He took hold of the shell (Kelipah) of the nut and looked at all its layers. He came to realize that the main pleasure of the spirits in the shell of the nut was just to cling to human beings and defile them, as it is written: \"And the delights of the sons of men, women very many (Heb. שִׁדּוֹת)\" (Kohelet 2:8). This means that the demons (Heb. shedim) take pleasure only in human beings.",
                "10. This verse also means that male and female demons are born from the pleasure human beings enjoy during their sleep at night. It was necessary for the Holy One, blessed be He, to create and supply the world with everything, including the Kelipot, so everything can be compared to the nut. Just as the inner part of the nut is surrounded by many layers of shells, the inner parts of all the worlds are similarly surrounded by many layers above and below in the supernal worlds and in this world, as will be explained. From the beginning of the secret of the supernal point which is Arich Anpin to the end of all grades"
            ],
            [
                "1. they are all intertwined, so each and everyone is a Kelipah to the other. A Kelipah is like a covering or an outer layer, just as a shell is a covering for a fruit.",
                "2. The primal point (which is Arich Anpin) is the internal light, whose purity, translucency and cleanness are beyond comprehension. When the expansion spreads beyond (Arich Anpin), which is the point, this expansion of that point becomes a chamber for the purpose of covering that point. The light of that point is incomprehensible because of its great purity.",
                "3. The chamber (namely, Abba and Imma) which covers the concealed point, (which is Arich Anpin), is a light that has no limits. This means that the light of the chamber is also unknown and inconceivable. Nevertheless, it is not as pure and subtle as the light of the primal point, (Arich Anpin), which is hidden and concealed. This chamber issues forth an expansion of the primal light, as it is written: \"And Elohim said, 'Let there be light'; and there was light\" (Gen. 1:3). This expansion, Yisrael-Saba and Tevunah, is a covering for that pure and subtle chamber namely, Abba and Imma which is more internal than Yisrael-Saba and Tevunah.",
                "4. From here (Yisrael-Saba and Tevunah) on, each one expanded within the other and became enclothed by one another until all the grades enclothed one another. One was the inner part and the other the outer layer. Though one is a garment in relation to what is above it, it has also become the inner aspect of another grade, a grade that is below it. (So Abba and Imma, which are considered a garment for Arich Anpin, became the inner part and internal aspect of Yisrael - Saba and Tevunah. Thus, Yisrael-Saba and Tevunah, which form a garment for Abba and Imma, became the inner part for Zeir Anpin. Thus, Zeir Anpin which is a garment for Yisrael-Saba and Tevunah became the inner part for his Female principle.) The same thing occurred below in the lower worlds (of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah. The Female principle of Atzilut is enclothed within Briyah, and Briyah within Yetzirah and Yetzirah within Asiyah. Accordingly, the Neshamah in a man is enclothed within the Ruach and the Ruach within the Nefesh and the physical body. In this image, the human being exists in this world with an inner part and an outer shell, which correspond to a spirit and a body.) All this is for the perfection of the world.",
                "5. When the moon was united with the sun, the moon had its own light. But after the moon was separated from the sun, it descended to the world of Briyah and was placed in charge of the hosts of Briyah, it belittled itself and diminished its own light. So Kelipot upon Kelipot were created, one above the other, to conceal the inner part. All this occurred to complete the light of the inner part, because without a shell no fruit can be had. This is the reason why it is written: \"Let there be luminaries (מְאֹרֹת),\" without Vav, which means a curse, because of the Kelipot that emerge due to the diminution of the light of the moon. All this was done for the perfection of the world. Therefore, it is written: \"To give light upon the earth\" (Gen. 1:15), as these Kelipot emerged in the secret of the shell that precedes the fruit.",
                "6. \"And Elohim made the two great luminaries\" (Gen. 1:16). \"And...made\", וַיַּעַשׂ, signifies the greatness and the full establishment of everything, as it should be. The phrase: \"The two great luminaries\" indicates that the two great luminaries, (which are Zeir Anpin and his Female principle) were united at first. This is the secret of the full name Yud Hei Vav Hei - Elohim, which although not openly revealed can be surmised. So the \"two great luminaries\" appear in a full name, even though the name Elohim shines only in a concealed way. The word \"great\" means that Zeir Anpin and his Female principle grew in greatness by this name as equals, so much so that they were called by the name that unites everything together, which is Mem-Tzadi-Pe-Tzadi Mem-Tzadi-Pe-Tzadi. Zeir Anpin received his greatness from the right one, his Female principle from the left one. In such a way, they are referred to as \"the two great luminaries.\" These are the most supernal names that precede the thirteen attributes of Mercy. The names Mem-Tzadi-Pe- Tzadi Mem-Tzadi-Pe-Tzadi are called \"great,\" because they became great and ascended, since they are supernal and derive from the secret of above. They benefit the world, as the worlds' existence depends on them. Similarly, the two luminaries that appear in the verse, which are Zeir Anpin and his Female principle, both rose as one, in one greatness.",
                "7. The moon was not at ease with the sun because she felt embarrassed before it. The moon said to the sun: \"Where do you feed your flock? Why do you make your flock to rest at noon?\" (Shir Hashirim 1:7). This is as if to say: How can a tiny candle shine in the middle of the day? \"Why should I be like one who cloaks himself?\" (Ibid.) That is: how can I remain in shame? Then she lowered herself to be head of the lower beings, as it is written: \"Go your way forth by the footsteps of the flock\" (Ibid. 8). Thus, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to her, 'Go and diminish yourself.'",
                "8. From then on, she had no light of her own. She had only the light she received from the sun. At first, they were united as one on the same level, but she later lowered herself from all of its grades. This means that it lost all her grades and emerged from the world of Atzilut. Although she is the head of the lower worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, she is nevertheless considered to have lost all her grades, as in principle a woman has no significance unless she is together with her husband. In other words, because the Female principle is separated from Zeir Anpin, her husband, and has left the world of Atzilut to go to that of Briyah, she has brought about the loss of all her grades. Even though she has become head in the world of Briyah, she does not consider this to be significant because she is separated from her husband, who is in the world of Atzilut. The phrase: \"The greater luminary\" (Gen. 1:16) alludes to Zeir Anpin, who is called by the name Yud Hei Vav Hei. \"The lesser luminary\" (Ibid.) alludes to the Female principle, who is called by the name Elohim, the last of the grades and an end to Thought namely, an end to the world of Atzilut that is called Thought. At first, the Female principle was inscribed above in Zeir Anpin in the fourth letter of the Holy Name Yud Hei Vav Hei, because the female is the lower Hei. In other words, when she was on the same level with Zeir Anpin, she was the lower Hei of the name Yud Hei Vav Hei. But afterward, she lowered herself to be called by the name Elohim.",
                "9. In spite of all this, the Female principle ascended on all sides and shone in all directions from above; that is, before she diminished herself and when she was the lower Hei in the assembling of the letters of the Holy Name, Yud Hei Vav Hei. Later, when she belittled herself, the grades expanded out from all sides, which means that she shone from the aspect of being before the lower Hei of Yud Hei Vav Hei and also from the aspect of being now the name Elohim. The grades that expanded from the aspect of her being above, from the lower Hei of Yud Hei Vav Hei, are called the \"rule (of) the day\" (Ibid.). The grades that expanded from the aspect of her being below, from the name Elohim, are called the \"rule (of) the night\" (Ibid.). The words \"the stars\" (Gen. 1:16) allude to countless hosts and groups of angels, who are all suspended in that \"firmament of heaven\" that is Yesod of Zeir Anpin and is called life of the worlds, as it is written: \"And Elohim set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth\" (Ibid. 17).",

It happened on the fourth day because the letters were completed and fixed in their places properly. In spite of all this, Malchut (kingdom) was not fixed properly in its place before the sixth day, because only then was the image of man completed and properly established. On the sixth day, the upper throne and the lower throne were established and all the worlds settled in their places. All the letters were set in their spheres"

                "1. after untying and releasing the complicated tie that existed among the letters.",
                "2. The fourth day, which is the kingdom of David, was rejected by the builders, as it is written: \"The stone which the builders rejected...\" (Tehilim 118:22) and also \"my mother's children were angry with me\" (Shir Hashirim 1:6). For this light, (referring to Malchut) lowered itself and diminished its own radiance while the Kelipot were established in their places. This gave place to the emerging of the Kelipot and their rule. Thus she seemed loathsome in the eyes of the righteous that built it. Only later, when she was completed and ready for union with Zeir Anpin, was it said she \"has become the head stone of the corner\" (Tehilim 118:22). All those lights that shone during the 6,000 year period were suspended in this firmament of heaven to establish with them the throne of David, namely, the kingdom (Malchut) of David.",
                "3. These lights of the kingdom of David shape the form below in order to prepare the form of all those that pertain to the inner form of the face of a man, because every inner form is so called, namely, the face of a man. From this, you should realize that every shape included in this expansion of the letter final Nun is called man, even though they do not actually have the face of a man. Hence, it is written: \"But you...are men\" (Yechezkel 34:31). You are called men, but not the rest of the idolatrous nations.",
                "4. Every spirit is called man, which means that only the aspect of the light of the spirit that is enclothed within the body is called man. So the body of the spirit of the holy side is only a garment; in other words, the spirit is the actual essence of man and the body is only its covering. But on the Other Side, the opposite applies. This is why it is written: \"You have clothed me with skin and flesh...\" (Iyov 10:11). The flesh of man is only a garment covering the essence of man, which is the spirit. Wherever it is written the flesh of man, it hints that the essence of man is inside. The flesh is only a vestment for man, a body for him, but the essence of man is the aspect of his spirit. For the lower aspects were melted with the melting of this spirit of the face of man, and other forms were fashioned, enclothed in a different kind of garment not by that of man, but of Kosher animals. These include: ox, sheep, goats, kids of the goats, rams, deer, fallow-deer and so on. They would have preferred to be included in the vestment of the face of a man, but were not. They became vestments for others; namely, garments for the face of an ox, the face of an eagle and the face of a lion. The inner spirit of the ox, sheep and goat, is called by the same name as the body of that spirit, because the body is a vestment for that name but does not own it. The body is the flesh of the ox and the ox is the inner spirit of that body; namely, its flesh is its garment. So it is with all animals; their bodies are named after the inner spirit that is enclothed within them.",
                "5. It is similar with the Other Side, which is not holy. The spirit that spreads within the idolatrous nations issues from the side that is not holy and is not the aspect of man. Therefore, it is not called by this name, as has been written: \"But you...are men.\" The name of this spirit is defiled. It is not called man and has no share in him because it extends from the wicked man (lit. 'man without elevation'), who does not want to ascend to the face of man above. So his body, the vestment of his spirit, is impure and his flesh is defiled. The impure part, which is the spirit, is on the inside and the flesh is his vestment. As long as the spirit dwells within that body, it is considered defiled. As the spirit leaves that vestment, namely the body, neither the body nor the vestment is called impure any longer, as the impure one, that is the spirit, has departed from it.",
                "6. From the lower aspects referring to animals, beasts and birds that were molded into shape by that impure spirit forms, namely private spirits, were drawn out. These were enclothed by other vestments, such as the forms of impure animals, and the Torah said of them, \"These shall be unclean to you\" (Vayikra 11:29). These forms include pigs and the birds and animals that belong to the Other Side. The spirit is called by that name, that is, defiled, and the body is its vestment. The body is called the flesh of the pig, because it is a pig in its inner being, in its spirit, while the flesh is a garment covering that spirit. Therefore, both aspects, those included within the secret of man and those included with the secret of the impure, are separated from and oppose each other. On the side of holiness are the spirit of man in general, and the spirits of pure animals, beasts and fowl, which are the particular. From the side of wicked man is the impure wicked man, who is considered the general aspect, and the spirits of impure animals, beasts and fowl, that are the particulars. They oppose each other. Every kind of animal stays with its own kind and does not mix with the opposite kind. Even if it does, it eventually returns to its own kind.",
                "7. All the upper shining lights shine within that firmament of heaven, so that proper forms may be drawn down below, as it is written: \"And Elohim set them in the firmament of heaven...to rule over the day and over the night\" (Gen. 1:17). For the dominion of the two lights is a proper dominion.",
                "8. \"The greater luminary,\" (namely Zeir Anpin) rules the day and \"the lesser luminary,\" which is his Female principle, rules the night. The secret learned from here is that the male rules by day and fills up the house with all that is needed, such as food and sustenance. As soon as night falls and the female takes command, everything in the house falls under her control, because then it is time for her dominion. As it is written: \"She rises also while it is yet night and gives food to her household\" (Mishlei 31:15); \"she\" and not \"he.\" So the Female principle, not Zeir anpin, gives at night, as the dominion over the day belongs to the male and the dominion over the night belongs to the female. The \"greater luminary\" is the sun, which has twelve openings and twelve hours, as the sun rules over the day. The \"lesser luminary\" is the moon, which also has twelve openings, the moon rules over the night, which has twelve hours. For this reason, it is written: \"On that day Hashem shall be one, and His Name One\" (Zecharyah 14:9). \"One\" is mentioned twice: once for Yud Hei Vav Hei, who is Zeir Anpin, \"the greater luminary,\" and once of His Name, which is the female, \"the lesser luminary.\" The sun together with its twelve openings becomes the thirteen attributes of Mercy. The moon together with its twelve openings also adds up to thirteen. So the sun becomes one and the moon becomes one; then it says, \"Hashem shall be one, and His Name One,\" because the numerical value of echad (one) adds up to thirteen. Thus, the sun and the moon become one and the day and night also become one. This is why it is written: \"And there was evening and there was morning, one day\" (Gen. 1:5). The secret of this union is only applicable on high. The verse: \"And the stars\" means that after the female has attained order in her house and retired with her husband, the maidens are left in charge of the house. The maidens who serve the female are called the stars. And the secret of the phrase \"And the stars\" is that the feminine principle turns control of the house over to them to deal with all the requirements of the house. That is, to prepare her for mating with the sun and to bestow the abundance of the day. This is during the darkness before dawn, when the maidens, the stars, rule, which is an inferior rule. Then darkness is doubled in the world. This is the secret meaning of, \"a portion to her maidens\" (Mishlei 31:15). Afterward, that is, after the mating in the darkness of the morning (before dawn breaks), the household returns to the dominion of the male during the day and everything is set properly in place. This means that the female is included within the male, according to the secret of the mating and is under his control. She reveals the light of the morning to the world, as it should be.",
                "9. \"And Elohim made the two great lights\" (Gen. 1:16). The sun is one and the moon is the other. Because of this, the lights that ascend are called the luminaries of the light whereas those that descend are called luminaries of the fire. These luminaries of the fire are the lower grades and rule over all the weekdays. Because of this, a blessing is recited over the candle when Shabbat ends because, at that point, the luminaries of the fire are given permission to rule again. The fingers of man represent the most hidden of all grades and secrets of the supernal world, and are divided into front and back. The back of the fingers represents the external part, an allusion to the fingernails. "

                " Come and behold! All Yisrael have a portion in the World to Come. Why is this so? Because they observe the covenant on which the world is established. This is as it is written in the verse: \"If My covenant be not day and night, it were as if I had not appointed the ordinance of heaven and earth\" (Jeremiah 33:25). Therefore, Yisrael, who has accepted the covenant (of Bris Milah and protecting the bris) and observe it, have a portion in the World to Come.\t",
                " Not only this. As a result, they are called 'righteous.' We deduce from this that whoever observes the covenant upon which the world is established is called 'righteous.' How do we know this? We know this from Joseph, who observed the  everlasting covenant (in the incident with Potiphar's wife), and was therefore called 'righteous.' And this is why it is written: \"Your people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land forever.\" (Rabbi Chiya thus explained the verse, \"Noah was a righteous man,\" as meaning that Noah observed the covenant). ",
                "Rabbi Elazar said that we have learned that whenever the term \"These (Heb. אֵלֶּה)\" appears, it always annuls something previously mentioned. Now, it is written in the portion of Beresheet, \"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted\" (Gen. 2:10). This river (corresponding to Yesod) is drawn and comes out of Eden, (which is Chochmah), and enters the garden, (Malchut), to water it from the supernal waters and bring it pleasure, making it produce fruit and seed. This gives satisfaction to everyone. The garden is pleased which brings pleasure to the river. As it is written: \"Because in it He rested\" (Ibid. 3). And it is also written: \"And He rested on the seventh day\" (Ibid. 2) (He rested in the Garden that is Malchut). This is the secret of the matter, for it produces offspring, and no other Sefirah can produce any fruit.",
                "Come and behold: so it was with Noah below. Noah was the sacred covenant below, as (Yesod) is above. And he is called \"Man of the earth\". So now we have learned a secret, that Noah needed the ark so he could unite with it and preserve the seed of the whole world. As it is written: \"to keep seed alive\" (Gen. 7:3).",
                "What is the ark? It is the ark (Malchut) of the covenant. And Noah and the ark below were like (Yesod and Malchut) above. The covenant is mentioned in relation to Noah, as it is written: \"And I will establish My covenant with you\" (Gen. 6:18). As long as the covenant was not established in Noah, he did not enter the ark, as it is written: \"And I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall come into the ark.\" Only then does the ark become the ark of the covenant, meaning that after the ark received and accepted Noah the righteous, who is the covenant, it became the ark of the covenant. So the ark and Noah are completely above. And because the covenant above brings forth offspring, so Noah begets generations. That is why \"These are the generations of Noah.\" This is to teach us that like the covenant above, (which is Yesod of Atzilut) Noah bore everlasting generations, because he merited the holy covenant, and Yesod of Atzilut, which is called the covenant, rests upon him.",

And what is (Yesod)? It is the Righteous. Thus, Noah is the righteous below, among the souls. And hence it is written: \"Noah was a righteous man\" to teach us that the world is maintained by him. And the secret of all this is revealed in the words, \"And Noah walked with Elohim\" (Gen. 6:9), which means to teach us that he never separated himself from Him. And he merited being called a righteous man on earth, as did the supernal Yesod, the foundation of the world. He is the covenant of peace and the peace of the world.

What is meant by \"overspread\", נָפְצָה? These words are analogous to the verse: \"and from thence the river parted\" (Gen. 2:10) (meaning that spreading out is similar to the supernal ark, which is the secret of the Garden). For from that point in the text onward, we find the separation and diffusion of progeny into all quarters of the world.

And so we find that the Holy One, blessed be He, named all the righteous twice: \"Moses, Moses\" (Ex. 3:4), \"Jacob, Jacob\" (Gen. 46:2), \"Abraham, Abraham\" (Gen. 22:11), \"Samuel, Samuel\" (I Shmuel 3:10) with the exception of Isaac. He is not named twice because when he approached the altar to be sacrificed, the soul that was within him in this world left him. And because it is said of Abraham, \"blessed are You who resurrect the dead\", so only the soul of the World to Come was returned to him. And that is why you shall find that the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, was not unified (on any righteous person in his lifetime). It was unified only on Isaac, because he was already considered as dead. He was like those who pass away from this world. The verse therefore states: \"Behold, He puts no trust in His holy ones\" (Iyov 15:15) because He does not unify His name on the righteous during their lifetimes.",
                "A different explanation given is that because he was righteous, He praised him twice (Noah Noah) perfect in his generations,\" but if he had lived in any other generation, such as that of Abraham or Moses or King David, then he would not have been considered righteous at all. Still another explanation is that if this is what he was able to perform in a generation in which all were wicked, how much more he could have done in a generation in which all were righteous.(End of the Tosefta)...",

Because by His deeds, the Holy One, blessed be He, reveals his prophecy to man. And when a prophecy  is revealed by preceding grievous deeds, it is called 'a grievous vision.' \"Who has made desolations (Heb. שַׁמּוֹת)\" assuredly alludes to names (Heb. שֵׁמוֹת), for a name is the cause of everything that happens.

It is written here and elsewhere, \"This one shall comfort us\" (Ibid.), \"This is Hashem; we have waited for Him\" (Yeshayah 25:9).

Because each one refers to a different level. As it is written in the verse: \"I saw (אֶת) Hashem\" (Yeshayah 6:1). It does not say 'I saw Hashem,' but \"אֶת Hashem.\" (This indicates that the particle אֶת (the) has a specific meaning). Here too, it is written of Noah: \"And he called his אֶת name Noah.\" As for, \"And he called his name Jacob,\" in reality his level is that of the Holy One, blessed be He, and this is why the particle אֶת is not mentioned there.

He said that \"a good man\" refers to the Holy One, blessed be He, who is called 'good', as it is written: \"Hashem is good to all\" (Tehilim 145:9). And it is also stated that \"Hashem is a man of war\" (Shemot 15:3). He is gracious and lends to \"all\" (which is Yesod), to the place that has nothing of its own. That place is nourished by it (Yesod). The words, \"he conducts his affairs justly\" refer to the fact that it is nourished only according to justice, as it is written: \"Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne\" (Tehilim 89:15).

But when the poor are attached to that region is called 'a cistern', with nothing of its own except what is put inside it.

Here, the words, \"running water,\" refer to Abraham, and \"out of (lit.

Noah the righteous man did not beget any offspring to populate the world until he entered the ark and all gathered and were concealed in it, after which they came out. They emerged from the ark to multiply in the world and to survive on earth. Had they not come from the ark, they would not have endured in the world. All this was according to the divine pattern. For, just as they left the ark above, so they left the ark below. Only now was the world able to exist permanently but not before.

                "Rabbi Yosi said: I believe the opposite. \"And the earth was corrupt before Elohim\" means that they did not sin openly. They sinned only before Elohim and not before man. But eventually, they also sinned openly. As it is written: \"And the earth was filled with violence\" (Ibid.), which indicates that there was not a place on earth that did not witness their sins. Therefore, the verse declares that they sinned in two ways, that is, in hiding and in the open.",

But after Noah had appeared, all the descendants of mankind are named after him, \"the generations of Noah.\" And this describes Noah's descendants in an honorable sense, because he secured for us permanent existence in the world, in contrast with \"the generations of Adam,\" which describes us in a dishonorable sense, as he caused us to be driven out of this world by bringing death to all.",

Now because Adam sinned and transgressed his Master's command, when (the builders of the Tower of Babel) came and rebelled against their Master, what was written about them? \"That the children of Adam had built\"! These are the children of Adam, the first man who had rebelled against his Master and transgressed His command.

The same applies to Yisrael; had they not sinned by the golden calf and drawn upon themselves the Evil Inclination they also would have never borne any offspring, and no new generations would have come into the world. The main point is that the power of mating derives mainly from the Evil Inclination. So without the Evil Inclination there can be no offspring.",

For better or for worst, the Holy One, blessed be He, shall always govern this land. For the best - because the land of Yisrael was never passed on to any other supernal governor.

And the hearts of the wicked are stout, as they do not repent and turn back to their Master. (This is why) they are called stout-hearted.

This refers to the body, which in comparison to the soul is like the female toward the male. \"And Lot his brother's son\" refers to the serpent that does not completely leave the body because the clinging of the body is not entirely gone from it.

So after thirteen years, when the Neshamah is aroused to amend the body, both amend that Nefesh that participated in the harsh (judgments) of the serpent and its evil desires. As it is written, \"and the Nefesh that they had made in Charan...\" the reason this is written in the plural is because it refers to the Neshamah and the body, which together amend the Nefesh, the Neshamah by awakening the body, and the body by its good deeds. With all of this, the Neshamah continues to attack the serpent in order to break it, so that it will surrender and be enslaved under the influence of repentance.

And this is why it is written, \"Get you out,\" so that the light may shine for you and for all who will descend from now and henceforth.",
                "Furthermore, (Rashbi) then discussed the verse, \"And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds; but the wind passes, and cleanses them\" (Iyov 37:21). \"And now men see not the bright light\": when? At the time when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Abraham, \"Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house.\" \"The bright light which is in the clouds\" (this is Abraham) because the Holy One, blessed be He, wished to attach Abraham to the supernal Light and have him shine there. \"And the wind passes, and cleanses them\" refers to Terach and all the people of his town, all of whom afterwards repented. As it is written, \"and the souls that they had made in Charan\" (Gen. 12:5). The verse, \"And you shall come to your fathers in peace\" (Gen, 15:15) - Terach had repented, for the Holy One, blessed be He, would not have said this to Abraham otherwise.",

This is so written because they had already left, as it is written, \"and they went out with them from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan.\" Therefore, it is written, \"departed\" rather than \"left.\"",

And all (both deeds and sins) are signed with his hand, so a man can be judged for all of his actions in this world, the early and the recent, the old and the new - not even one of them is forgotten. Therefore, it is written, \"that all men whom He has made may know His work.\" Just as all of the actions he committed in this world were together in body and in spirit, so he must account for them together in body and spirit, before he leaves this world.",

But the wicked person, even though he sees these righteous people, stiffens his neck and refuses to learn from them.

Similarly, it is written, \"Take Aaron\" (Num. 20:25) and \"Take the Levites\" (Num. 3:45). This is why \"And Abram took\"; he persuaded her with words, telling her how evil were the ways of their generation. Therefore it is written, \"And Abram took Sarai his wife.\"",

Because it is written, \"And the souls that they had made in Charan.\" The merit of these souls accompanied Abraham.",

Until that time, the Holy One, blessed be He, had not spoken with Abraham. Therefore, why did He start with \"Go for yourself\"? Because the Hebrew words for \"Go for yourself,\" which are לֶךְ לְךָ, have a numerical value of 100. By using these words, the Holy One, blessed by He, gave Abraham a hint that he would have a son in his hundredth year.",
                "But come and behold, All that the Holy One, blessed be He, performs on earth is done according to Wisdom.

This is why it is written, \"Go for yourself.\" And that is the first grade that Abraham was to attain in coming to the Holy One, blessed be He.",

And David said, Where shall I go up? And Hashem said, 'to Hevron'\" (II Shmuel 2:1). Since Saul had died, and David was fit to receive the kingship, why then did he not receive the kingship over Yisrael immediately? ",

David was not ready to receive the kingship until he had connected himself to the Patriarchs buried in Hebron, through whom he was to receive the kingship. Therefore, he remained in Hevron for seven years, until he was fit to receive the kingship properly. Thus, everything occurred by the secret of Wisdom so that his kingship would be properly established! The same applies to Abraham; he did not achieve complete fulfillment with the Holy One, blessed be He, until he entered the land of Yisrael.",
                "See, it is written, \"And Abram passed through the land.\" Why \"passed through (Heb. וַיַּעֲבֹר)\" instead of 'went'! This is an allusion to the Holy Name by which the world is sealed  that contains 72 engraved letters, all of which are within that name. (וַיַּעֲבֹר (Vav-Yud-Ayin-Bet-Resh) consists of two parts Resh-Yud-Vav (numerically=216) and Ayin-Bet (=72) that refer to the 216 letters and 72 names). Thus, it is written in one place, \"And...passed through,\" while it is written in another, \"And Hashem passed by (Heb. וַיַּעֲבֹר) before him and proclaimed...\" (Shemot 34:6) [just as there it is speaking of the Holy Name of Ayin-Bet (72), so too vaya'avor here is a reference to the Holy Name of Ayin-Bet (72)].",
                "In the book of Rabbi Yesa Saba (the elder), it states, It is written, \"And Abram passed through the land,\" while elsewhere it is written, \"I will make all My goodness pass before you\" (Shemot 33:19). It gives a hint about the holiness of the land, which emanates from a supernal place in all its proper goodness. \"To the place of Shchem to the plain of Moreh\" - from one side to the other side, as was befitting. \"And the Canaanite were then in the land,\". It has been explained that at that time the curse of the evil serpent dominated the land, and the world was cursed. As it is written, \"Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren\" (Gen. 9:25), and also \"you are cursed above all cattle\" (Gen. 3:14). When Abraham came close to the Holy One, blessed be He, it is written, \"And Hashem appeared to Abram\" (Gen. 12:7), now was revealed to him that which he did not know, because of the profound force that governed the land. Thus appeared to him what "

                "\"And he moved from there to the mountain\" (Gen. 12:8), where he recognized the mountain of Hashem and all the grades planted on that place. \"And pitched his tent\" (Heb. אָהֳלה) which alludes to the Nukva, as 'אָהֳלה' is not spelled with a Vav but with a Hei. Thus he spread a curtain and received the kingdom of heaven, along with all the grades that come from it. He then knew that the Holy One, blessed be He, rules over all, and he built an altar. There were actually two altars, because here the Holy One, blessed be He, appeared to him as the ruler over all. He now acquired knowledge of the supernal wisdom, which he had not previously attained. He therefore built two altars one for the grade that appeared and one to the grade still hidden.",
                "Come and behold, It is written first, \"and there he built an altar to Hashem, who had appeared to him,\" and later just \"and there he built an altar to Hashem,\" without adding \"who appeared to him.\" And all this is according to the secret of Wisdom. Abraham was then crowned from grade to grade, until he ascended to his own grade. This is the meaning of \"And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the Negev.\" This is the south, Abraham's portion.  \"Going on still,\" grade after grade, until he reached the south, where he was properly attached. He then ascended to the south's grade, that is, he deserved to be a Chariot of Chesed of Zeir Anpin called 'south.' After Abraham was crowned with his grades in the Holy Land and entered the holy grade, that is, the grade of Chesed, and the aspect of the hidden world,  then it is written, \"And there was famine in the land\" (Gen. 12:10), they were not sure how to approach the Holy One, blessed be He, as in the secret of the verse \"not a famine for bread, nor a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of Hashem\" (Amos 8:11).",
                "\"And there was famine in the land\" because until then the power ruling over the land did not supply the land with strength and nourishment. This occurred because (the Nukvah) was not completely built and not established. When Abraham saw that the power appointed over the land did not supply it with might and holy strength as it merited, then \"Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there\" (Gen. 12:10). How did Abraham know (that the land still needed correction)? From the verse, \"To your seed I will give this land.\" Abraham then knew that the only way to amend the land was through the holy grades of his descendants. Abraham then understood the secret of Wisdom - the land will not be properly mended in holiness, except as we have said. He therefore went down to Egypt, from there to correct that which was lacking.",

And concerning this King Solomon said in his wisdom, \"Who knows whether the spirit of man goes upwards, and the spirit of the beast goes downwards\" (Kohelet 3:21). The bestial Nefesh is the Nefesh that comes from the side of the Evil Inclination.",

The Neshamah reaches a person in Binah, as it is written, \"And to man He said, Behold the fear of Hashem, that is wisdom (Heb. חָכְמָה)\" (Iyov 28:28). The Neshamah comes to a person through repentance, which is called 'Binah' and 'Sarah'. The Ruach is called 'the voice', and is also called 'Da'at.' And this is drawn down to a person who raises his voice in Torah. (The Ruach is) also called the written Torah, and all the positive deeds come from the mental Nefesh.",
                "In a similar way, the Holy One, blessed be He, created the body from the four elements namely, Fire, Air, Earth and Water,  which correspond to the Neshamah of Neshamah, the Neshamah, the Ruach, and the Nefesh. Water which is the aspect of the male refers to the sweet waters of holiness. The contrasting bitter waters represent the Evil Inclination. The holy fire which is the aspect of the female. There is the foreign fire, to which the words \"that he come not at all times to the holy place\" (Vayikra 16:2) apply. And this is the female of the Evil Inclination. The holy Ruach is the aspect of the Male, similar to the Ruach that comes from the Sefirah of Da'at. The unholy Ruach, which is the Evil Inclination.

When it arrives there, it meets the Cherubs and the flame of the revolving sword. If it is meritorious, then they see the letter, which is the sign, and open the gate for it to enter. If they do not see the letter, they reject it and do not allow it to enter.",
                "And it dwells there some time, sitting and clothing itself in the image of this world. And on the first day of the month and on Shabbat, when it wants to rise, the righteous men who are in the Garden of Eden give it a letter as a sign. And it ascends through that same pillar, where it meets the watchmen of the walls of Jerusalem. If it is meritorious, they open the gate and it enters. If not, they take the letter away and throw it out. As it is written, \"The watchmen that go about the city found me...the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me\" (Shir Hashirim 5:7). (The veil) is the letter given as a sign, which has been taken away from it, by the watchmen of the walls of Jerusalem. End of Sitrei Torah. ",
                "\"And Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there\" (Gen. 12:10). Why did he go down to Egypt? Because it looked like the garden of Hashem (Gan Eden). As it is written, \"like the garden of Hashem, like the land of Egypt...\" (Gen. 13:10). Because a river flows down on the right, as it is written, \"The name of the first is Pishon; that is it which encompasses the whole land of Chavilah, where there is gold\" (Gen. 2:11). So Abraham achieved knowledge and complete faith. Abraham then wanted to become familiar with all the grades that are attached below. And Egypt came from the right; from the aspect of the River of Pishon, which is the secret of Chochmah of the Right Column. Come and behold, famine only comes to the land when Mercy leaves Judgment. \"And it came to pass, when he came (lit. 'caused to come') near to enter to Egypt...\" (Gen. 12:11). Rabbi Elazar said that the verse says, \"when he caused to come near,\" whereas it should have stated, 'When he came near.' Why does it say, \"when he caused to come near?\" This is similar to the verse, \"And Pharaoh caused to come close...\" (Shemot 14:10), that he brought Yisrael to come near to repentance. The same applies here, so \"caused to come near\" means he brought himself to come near to the Holy One, blessed be He, as should properly be. \"To enter to Egypt,\", to observe those grades, and keep his distance from them, as well as to keep his distance from the worshipers of Egypt.",
                "Rabbi Yehuda said, Come and behold, Since he went down to Egypt without consent, his offspring were enslaved in Egypt for four hundred years. As it is written, \"and Abram went down to Egypt. It does not say (that Hashem told him) 'Go down to Egypt!' Therefore, he was in misery all that night because of Sarah.",
                "And he said to Sarah his wife, 'Behold now, I know that you are a fair woman to look upon'\" (Gen. 12:11). Could it be that until then Abraham did not know that she was a \"fair woman to look upon\"?  This has already been explained that until then he did not look upon the image of Sarah, because of their excessive modesty with each other. But when he \"came near to enter to Egypt,\" she revealed herself, and he saw her.",
                "Another explanation for why he knew is that most people are affected by the hardship of the journey, but Sarah remained beautiful and her appearance did not change. Another explanation of the words, \"Behold, now I know...\" is that Abraham saw the Shechinah accompanying Sarah. For this reason, Abraham felt confident and said, \"She is my sister.\" The phrase, \"my sister,\" has two meanings. The first is literal. The second is figurative, as in the verse, \"Say to wisdom; You are my sister.\" (Mishlei 7:4). It also is written, \"Say, I pray you, you are my sister\" (Gen. 12:13). ('You' alludes here to the Shechinah). And it is also written, \"speak you to us\" (Devarim 5:24). In addressing the Shechinah, he said, \"That it may be well with me for your sake,\" (for the sake of the Shechinah) and also \"my soul shall live because of you,\" because, as a result of this, a person is elevated up to the path of life. \"Say, I pray you, you are my sister...\" Rabbi Yesa said, Abraham knew that all the Egyptians are lecherous. Since he knew this, "

Our sages have taught that when the soul of a human being rises from earth to heaven, it stands in the Divine Illumination. The Holy One, blessed be He, visits it. Come and listen, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai said, When the soul of a righteous person stands in the place where the Shechinah of His blessed Glory rests and is worthy of sitting by Her, the Holy One, blessed be He, calls upon the patriarchs. And He says to them, Go and visit so-and-so, the righteous person who has come, and welcome him in peace in My Name. And they claim it is not proper for a father to go and visit his child, but rather the child should seek after his father to see him.",
                "The Holy One, blessed be He, then calls upon Jacob and says to him, You, who suffered the sorrow of (raising) children, go and welcome so-and-so, the righteous person who has come here, and I shall go along with you, as it is written, \"those who seek your face Jacob, Selah\" (Tehilim 24:6). It does not say \"seek\" in the singular, but in the plural. Rabbi Chiya said, This we understand from the first part of the verse.

The Holy One, blessed be He, established a covenant with Jacob alone, more than (the one He established) with all his fathers. He made him a Throne of Glory distinguishing him from his predecessors. And the reason is that his forefathers, who are Abraham and Isaac, are not able to shine without him.

                "Rabbi Eliezer was sitting and studying Torah when Rabbi Akiva arrived. He said to him, Master, what are you studying? He replies, The passage where it is written, \"and to make them inherit the Throne of Glory\" (I Shmuel 2:8) what does \"and to make them inherit the Throne of Glory\" mean? This is Jacob, the Patriarch for whom he made a Throne of Glory by himself that would receive Torah for the souls of the righteous. And the Holy One, blessed be He, goes with (Jacob) on the first day of every month. And when the soul sees the glory of the mirror, which is the Shechinah of the Master, (the soul then) praises Him and bows down in front of the Holy One, blessed be He. This is  \"Bless Hashem, my soul...\" (Tehilim 104:1).",

Rabbi Akiva continued, As well as this, it praises the Holy One, blessed be He, thanks Him for the body that is left in this world, and says, \"Bless Hashem, my soul, and all that is within me, bless His Holy Name\" (Tehilim 103:1). The words, \"all that is within me,\" allude to the body. At first, the soul praises and thanks the Holy One, blessed be He, for its own achievements. Then it says, \"Bless Hashem, my soul! Hashem my Elohim, You are very great.\" And then it praises and thanks Him for the body. And then it says, \"Bless Hashem, my soul, and all that is within me, bless His Holy Name.\" ",

From the passage where it is written, \"And Hashem appeared to him by the terebinths of Mamre.\" This is Jacob, (who is referred to as Mamre). Why is the name Mamre? Because Jacob inherited two hundred worlds in Eden, and he is the Throne. And Rabbi Yitzchak explains, The numerical value of Mamre is 281. So there are the two hundred of Eden, as it is written, \"and those that guard the fruit thereof two hundred\" (Shir Hashirim 8:12), and 81 is the numerical value of Kise ('throne'). For this reason, \"And Hashem appeared to him by the terebinths of Mamre.\" And for this reason, (Jacob) is called Mamre.

The verse, \"and he sat in the tent door\" is as it is written, \"Hashem, who (Heb. מִי) shall abide in Your tabernacle (or: 'tent') (Tehilim 15:1).

Then the soul of the righteous is happy with what it has done, and is happy with its deposit.

If so, why did the sea seize him when he went away, and not the land from which he ran?",

This is the upper chamber, while the Garden of Eden is lower, and an earthly garden is in apposition and draws from it daily.",
                "Rabbi Abahu said that 48 prophets stood for Yisrael. Each one took his share, which was the essence of one drop from the drops of Eden. If every prophet who took one drop had the grade of the holy spirit, this was more true for Adam, who received the 48 drops. From this, you learn the scope of his wisdom.",
                "Rabbi Ba said that Rabbi Kahana asks, Where did the prophets get these drops? We learned each drop that comes out of Eden includes the spirit of wisdom. Therefore, it was decreed that there is water that raises wise men and water that raises fools. This water that drops from Eden raises wise ones.",
                "As Rabbi Yosi said, So the water containing the drops comes from the most ancient of four rivers, as it is written, \"The name of the first is Pishon\" (Gen. 2:11). Why is it written, \"the name of the first is Pishon?\" Pishon is different from the rest because it flows into the land of Egypt. Therefore, the wisdom of Egypt is greater than that of the rest of the world.",
                "When it was decreed that the wisdom of Egypt was lost, the Holy One, blessed be He, took the drops and threw them across the garden into the river of the Garden of Eden, as it is written, \"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden\" (Gen. 2:10). And when the drops, which remain in the garden, were taken from Egypt, wisdom was gone from Egypt. It separated into four other rivers, of which the most special was Pishon. Wisdom was thus lost in Egypt when the drops were taken from Egypt and left in the garden.",
                "Every prophet was sucking from that spirit that came out of Eden. This is the meaning of \"walking in the garden in the breeze of the day\" (Gen. 3:8). It is stored in the Garden of Eden for the future. This is the river that Ezekiel saw in his prophecy. Therefore the scripture reads, \"For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Hashem\" (Isaiah 11:9), as this water always causes the knowledge in the world to increase.",
                "The sages said that the souls of all the righteous are above in Eden, and wisdom is strengthened in the world because of what descends from Eden. How much more so for every one of those who stand in it and take their fill of its pleasure and brightness.",
                "Rabbi Yitzchak said, If the soul deserves to pass through the gates of the terrestrial Jerusalem, the great angel Michael hastens to greet and walk with it. The ministering angels wonder about this and ask, \"Who is that, coming up from the wilderness\" (Shir Hashirim 8:5). Who rises to be among the high ones from the destroyed body, which resembles a breath, as is written, \"Man is like a breath\" (Tehilim 144:4)? He answers by saying, \"My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is distinguished she is the only one of her mother\" (Shir Hashirim 6:9). Her mother is the Throne of Glory, a mother for the soul that gives it birth, for the soul is derived from her.",
                "\"The daughters saw her, and called her happy\" (Ibid.). This refers to the other souls, whose rank is high and who are called the daughters of Jerusalem. According to Rabbi Yosi, they are called the daughters of Jerusalem while the other ones are called the daughters of Lot. \"The daughters saw her, the rest of the souls praise it and say to it, Come in peace. \"The queens and the concubines praised her\" (Ibid.). The queens are the Patriarchs that are queens. The concubines are the proselytes. They all praise and laud it until it enters above. Then the soul is in its ascended place, and longevity is maintained, as it is written, \"And Abraham was old, advanced in age (lit. 'coming into the days')\" (Gen. 24:1), as he entered longevity in the World to Come.",
                "Rabbi Abba Saba (the elder) stood up and said, May peace and tranquillity come to you, Rabbi Shimon, the son of Yochai, for restoring the diadem to its former splendor. For we learned in the first Mishnah that since the soul is perfected in the supernal place, it does not return to the body. It remains in the same condition, but other souls are created and come out of it. Then Rabbi Shimon, the son of Yochai, taught that although this world is vanity and the body is a putrid drop of semen, yet the soul enters it. In the future, when everyone will be refined and the body will be more pure, sustained and complete, there will be no reason for the soul to enter it with all its completeness.",
                "Rabbi Acha said, The Holy One, blessed be He, will give the very soul and very body existence in the future, but both will be whole and have completeness of knowledge so they can achieve what they did not achieve in this world.",
                "\"And Abraham was old, advanced in age (lit. 'coming with the days').\" Rabbi Bo said that, according to Rabbi Yochanan, this refers to the world of days and not to that world which is night. Rabbi Ya'akov said those worlds are called days because of all the pleasures and the brightness that he inherits. \"And Hashem had blessed Abraham in all\" (Gen. 24:1) refers to the office that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him of His name, which is the letter Hei by which the world was created.",
                "We learned that Rabbi Yochanan said, Metatron, the great minister, is a boy, a servant whose Rabbi, his master, rules him. He is in charge of the soul and gives it daily of the light he was ordered to give it. In the future, he will receive an account in writing from the cemetery, from Dumah for each body that he can show to his Master. He will turn that backbone into yeast to build the body under the ground, to mend and wholly revive the body, a body without a soul. Later, the Holy One, blessed be He, will send the soul to its place. This will be after it comes to the land of Yisrael.",
                "Rabbi Yitzchak said, it is then written, \"And Abraham said to the eldest servant of his house, that ruled...\" (Gen. 24:2). If we look at this from the aspect of wisdom, what is \"his servant\"? Rabbi Nehorai responded, We need look only at the words \"his servant\", the servant of Hashem, close to His worship. Who is he? He is Metatron, who will beatify the body in the grave, as we have said.",
                "Thus the words, \"And Abraham said to his eldest servant\" refer to Metatron, the servant of Hashem. The phrase, \"The eldest servant of his house\" is the beginning of the creations of Hashem. \"That ruled over all that he had\" means that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him power over all His hosts, namely over the upper angels.",
                "We learned that Rabbi Shimon quoted Rabbi Yosi who quoted Rav saying that all the hosts of the servant receive light and delight in the splendor of the soul, as the light of the soul in the World to Come is greater than the light of the throne. It seems that the soul was taken from the throne, each had according to what was appropriate for it. Rav Nachman added that it is actually greater than the light of the throne, as it is written, \"The likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it\" (Ezekiel 1:26), above it in splendor.",
                "When he goes to perform the errand (of Hashem), all his hosts and his Chariot are nourished by that splendor of the oul. And the soul says to him, \"Put...your hand\" namely, your escort, \"under my thigh\" (Gen. 24:2). This is the light that flows from the soul.",
                "Rabbi Yehuda the son of Rabbi Shalom said that we have been taught that when he goes on an errand for the Holy One, blessed be He, He moves His upper hosts by one letter of His name, namely by the letter Yud of the name Yud Hev Vav Hei. Hei is the secret of Imma and Abba, the root of the soul's light. Rav Huna said, Yerechi ('my thigh') has the same numerical value as ram (lit. 'high'), which is what the soul says, that is, \"Put...your hand,\" your escort, under the grade of the high and elevated, that rules over all. After the soul commanded the escort of high ones to be under Him, it told him I make you swear a great oath. Rabbi Yitzchak said, It is written, \"Elohim of the heaven, and Elohim of the earth\" (Ezekiel 1:26). Since he already mentioned Hashem, why add \"Elohim of the heaven? Rabbi Yehuda said, to show that He is Master over everything simultaneously. In one instant, He moves everything, and everything is nothing compared to Him, heaven and earth in the oath, which is the secret of the letter Yud, which indicates that this light governs all the grades and everything is as naught compared to it. Rabbi Yitzchak said that by two letters of His name He moves His whole hosts. This is to show that He is all, and there is nothing save Him.",
                "\"And I will make you swear by Hashem, Elohim of the heaven...\" Ran Huna said, If he had been with those versed in the Baraita at the time that they revealed the secret of this verse, he would not have left them without knowing everything, for he saw great depth in their utterances. They revealed much, but man does not understand what they revealed. Come and behold, The soul causes to swear this oath of the covenant, as it is written, \"That you shall not take a wife to my son\" (Gen. 24:3).",
                "Rabbi Yitzchak said, from here, it is understood that the soul said to Metatron, Because you are going on this mission to resurrect the dead, \"you shall not take a wife for my son.\" This means you shall not take a body for my son. He cannot enter another body, an idolatrous body, a body not worthy of him, but only the body which is actually my own, the very one I came from. And this is what is meant by the verse, \"But you shall go to my country, and to my kindred\" (Ibid. 4). ",
                "Rabbi Yosi said, What is meant by the verse, \"And take a wife to my son Isaac\"? Rabbi Yitzchak replies, The very body that suffered with me in that world and had no pleasure or content for fear of its Possessor (this refers to the Luz bone). This very body shall you take to laugh with, in that rejoicing of the righteous, to take delight in it in the joy of the Holy One, blessed be He. Have pleasure with it, because it is time for laughter, as it is written, \"Then was our mouth filled with laughter\" (Tehilim 126:2).",
                "Rabbi Yehudah, the son of Rabbi Yitzchak, said, Come and listen, An angel does only one errand, not two at the same time. There are, however, two errands to perform, to resurrect the body in the grave and to make it rise to the land of Yisrael, where the soul will be enclothed in it. But one angel does not perform two errands. Rabbi Abba said, There is one angel with an inkstand at his waist. (Gabriel) He will put a mark on the brow of each. Afterward, the great minister (Metatron) will go and mend each one, preparing it to receive its soul. This is the meaning of the verse, \"He shall send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife\" (Gen. 24:7). What is meant by \"before you\"? It indicates that (Hashem will send an angel) before your errand.",
                "Rabbi Eliezer went to see his Rabbi, Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai, on the first day of the month. When he arrived he told him, 'O Well for those who see, filled with drawn water, yet gushing more from its own source. What does it seek here?' He answers, It behooves a man to greet his Rabbi (on Rosh Chodesh). He said to him, Not for that reason I said. I see in your face that there is a new deep secret about which you are going to ask.",
                "He said to him, I see that primordial light travels by ten and conducts everything according to the secret of ten. We learned that there are ten writings, ten keys to the hospital in its hands. It takes these and ten notes in the Garden of Eden to mend the earth for the bodies of the righteous.",
                "He said, Eliezer my son, you have seen more than a holy angel. The world,  is created by ten, and it is conducted by ten. The holy throne is according to ten. The Torah is by ten. Its traveling is by ten. The supernal worlds are by ten. And there is the supernal one above them all, blessed be He.",
                "I will tell you something else. Those versed in the Mishnah put some thought into it, as it is written, \"And the servant took ten camels\" (Gen. 42:10). R' Eliezer said to him, Master, I know this verse, but what is the meaning of, \"For all the goods of his master were in his hands\" (Ibid.)? He said to him, This is the name of his Master (the Shechinah) that went with him to bring him and to protect him. R' Eliezer said, Assuredly this is \"For My name was in him\" (Shemot 23:21).",
                "Rabbi Abahu said, Come and behold, He who knows His name perfectly knows that He and his Name are one. The Holy One, blessed be He, and His Name are one, as it is written, \"Hashem shall be one, and his Name One\" (Zecharyah 14:9). That is, the name and He are one.",
                "Rabbi Abba said, We should look at the verse, \"And he made his camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water\" (Gen. 24:11). According to Rabbi Abba, outside the city means in the cemetery. \"By a well of water\" refers, as we learnt, that those who are the first (to be revived) in the cemetery, are those who dealt in Torah. As we have learned, when a man comes into his grave, he is first asked if he set appointed times to study Torah, as it is written, \"And he shall be the faith of your times\" (Isaiah 33:6). Without question, he who responds yes, is revived first.",
                "Rabbi Abba said that \"at the time of evening\" (Gen. 24:11) refers to Friday, Shabbat eve, the time of the resurrection of the dead. What is the meaning? We have learned that the world exists for 6,000 years and that Erev Shabbat is the 6th millennium, the ending of all. Thus \"at the time of evening\" means the time of ending for everything. The phrase, \"At the time that the women go out to draw water\" refers to the scholars of the Torah, who draw the water of Torah, the time to go out and shake off the dust.",
                "Rabbi Abba added that there is more to know, as we have learned that those occupied in knowing their Master in this world and their soul to perfection in the World to Come, deserve to get out of the grave by the oath of the soul. (Metatron) comes to know which is the soul's proper body and it is written, \"Behold, I stand here by the well of water\" (Gen. 24:43). Although it is the scholar of the Torah,  (Metatron goes)to look for perfection, as it is written, \"And it shall come to pass, that the maid who comes forth to draw, and I say to her, 'Give me, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher'\" (Ibid. 44), which means 'tell me by hint, the knowledge of the name, from what you conceived'.",
                "\"And she says to me, 'Both drink you'\" (Gen. 24:44). (She knows three things) You are a servant like me; The knowledge of you does not compare with the knowledge of Hashem, blessed be He; It behooves you to conceive that you are a creature like me.",
                "\"I will draw water for your camels also\" (Gen. 24:19) indicates that it also drew forth for his attendants from what it perceived. The words \"your camels\" means \"your retinue.\" In other words, my understanding is that: 1) Your retinue was not aware; 2) \"I know that I have an advantage over you\"; 3) I know how you were created from the radiance that was placed with you. If the body mentions (all of these) let this sign be delivered to me. Then I shall know she is the woman. She is the body from the same soul according to the oath it made me swear.",
                "\"And it came to pass, before he had done speaking\" (Gen. 24:15). According to Rabbi Yitzchak, Rabbi Yehudah said while he was thinking of how to try the body, it is written, \"Behold, Rivkah came out,\" which is the holy body that is occupied in Torah. It pounds the body for knowledge of the conception of his Possessor, \"who was born to Betuel\" (Ibid.). Rav Yehuda said she was the daughter (Heb. bat) of El, the \"son of Milkah\" (Ibid.), who is a son to the king (Heb. Malkah) of the universe. \"The wife of Nachor, Abraham's brother\" alludes to the company of the mind, the body attached to the mind, and is the brother of the soul, and the phrase, \"With her pitcher upon her shoulder\" alludes to the weight of wisdom upon it.",
                "\"And the servant ran to meet her\" (Gen. 24:17) refers to Metatron. And said, \"Let me, I pray you, drink a little water of your pitcher\" give me a hint of the wisdom of the knowledge of your Maker that you dealt with in the world you left. ",
                "Rabbi Abba said, We have explained that after that it is written, \"And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands\" (Ibid. 47). Rabbi Abba said that these are the bones that were scattered here and there. He puts them together and weighs them one upon the other, as is written, \"And strengthen your bones\" (Isaiah 58:11). Rabbi Abba said, At that time, the body stands in the land of Yisrael, where the soul enters it. ",
                "Rabbi Yochanan asks, Who conducts the body to the land of Yisrael? Rabbi Zeira said, The Holy One, blessed be He, digs caverns under the ground and they roll to the land of Yisrael. Hence it is written, \"And the earth shall cast out the shades of the dead\" (Isaiah 26:19).",
                "Rabbi Yitzchak said, Gabriel conducts them to the land of Yisrael. How do we know that? From the verse, \"Will you go with this man?\" (Gen. 24:58). Elsewhere, it is written, \"The man Gabriel\" (Daniel 9:21). Rabbi Yosi asks, Why is it written, \"And Rivkah had a brother and his name was Laban\" (Ibid. 29)? Rabbi Yitzchak answered, The Evil Inclination does not pass away from the world, and though it is not entirely present, some of it is.",
                "Come and behold, When it was in this world, it was called Lot. In the World to Come, it will be partly canceled and called Laban, its not as corrupt as before, but as one who washed the filth off of himself. Why is there need of Laban? Rabbi Shimon said, It is needed for being fruitful and multiply. If there is no Evil Inclination, nothing is fruitful or multiplies.",
                "Come and listen, Since the body was constructed and established, why is it then written, \"And they sent away Rivkah, their sister, and her nurse...\" (Gen. 24:59). What does the phrase \"and her nurse\" imply? It is the power of movement. Rabbi Yitzchak further clarifies this by explaining that this is the power of the body.",
                "Rabbi Abahu opened with the verse, \"Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon...\" (Shir Hashirim 4:8). Rabbi Abahu said, Once the body was built and established, it is brought to the land of Yisrael to receive its soul. The soul awaits it there and comes out to greet it, as is written, \"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field\" (Gen. 24:63). \"Come with me from Lebanon, my bride\" is the soul, and \"Look from the top of Amana\" (Ibid.) corresponds to, \"And he lifted his eyes and saw\" (Ibid.).",
                "Rabbi Yehuda said, If this is the soul, Abraham is satisfactory, as was said. What then is Isaac? Rabbi Abahu said, The friends said it is now called Isaac because of the increased joy in the world.",
                "Rabbi Abahu said, First the soul was called Abraham and the body Sarah. Now the soul is called Isaac and the body Rivkah. Rabbi Shimon said, It was taught in the Mishnah that the soul awaited the body in the land of Yisrael forty years before the body existed. Where? At the Temple.",
                "Rabbi Abahu said, Look at the verse, \"And took Rivkah, and she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death\" (Gen. 24:67). When he loves the body and is comforted by it, it is time for laughter and delight in the world.",
                "Rabbi Yehuda said, Now this whole portion of the scripture is made clear, but I do not know the meaning of the verse, \"Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah\" (Gen. 25:1). To a reasonable mind, this text is contradictory. It contradicts the explanation concerning the soul and body at the time of resurrection.",
                "Rav Dimi arrived and said, I have heard an explanation for this portion, but I do not remember it. They said that the high and strong did not present it for revelation. What have we to say? Rabbi Yehudah stood up and said that the portion is revealed in the Yeshivah of our friends, the sages of the Mishnah.",
                "They stood up and began walking, he, Rabbi Yeesa, and Rabbi Chiya. They found Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Shimon, who was revealing the secret of Tefilin. They came before him and asks, Master, what are you engaged in? He replies, I am recounting the reason for the Tefilin, for blessed is the man who dons Tefilin and knows the sense thereof.",
                "They said, If it is well before you, Master, may you tell us something. They said, We learned from your father that the Holy One, blessed be He, in His great love for the children of Yisrael, told them to build Him a tabernacle, reflecting the supernal high Chariot, so He might come and dwell among them. This is the meaning of, \"And let them make Me a sanctuary, so that I may dwell among them\" (Shemot 25:8). We learned from your father that the reason for the Tefilin was hidden in this verse.",
                "He said to them, Come and behold, The Temple was made to reflect the upper one in its holy Chariots. And then the Holy One, blessed be He, caused His Shechinah to dwell among them. In this manner, those versed in the Mishnah discussed the reason for the Tefilin. Any man who wears tefilin will be patterned after the upper Chariots, the lower Chariot and the upper Chariot so that His kingdom will come and the Shechinah will dwell upon him. We learned that there are deep secrets in the tefilin and its patterns. There are three Chariots within them, like the high and holy ones, reflecting the secrets of the three letters of His Holy Name. For these three Chariots are the three letters YUD-HEI-VAV. The four sections govern the four letters of His Holy Name. This is therefore the secret of the Shin of three crowns and Shin of four crowns, the three kings ruling over the body and the Tefilin upon the Holy One, blessed be He, above the head Tefilin and the hand Tefilin, four sections, which correspond to the Shin with four heads. Similarly, the heart rides as if on the lower Chariot. And the lower one is mounted. We have also learned that this Chariot of the arm, is below. The heart rides as if beneath. It was given to it to bring in all the heavenly hosts. So the heart rides down below and all the limbs of the body are given to it.",
                "Above the heart are the four sections of the brain. The Holy One, blessed be He, is supreme ruler over them. He is King of all. And the secret of wisdom resembles the Temple, as it is written, \"And make one Cherub on the one end, and the other Cherub on the other end\" (Shemot 25:19). Above them is the King's Shechinah, within the four letters Yud Hev Vav Hei. Yud-Hei is on the right Cherub, and Vav-Hei on the left cherub. Within the two Chariots, the upper Chariot is on the right Cherub and the lower Chariot is on the left Cherub.",
                "Similarly, the heart and the brain, the heart is on one side and the brain on the other side. Upon them is the King's Shechinah in four sections. Rabbi Elazar said, From now on, the secrets of the crowns of the letters, the sections in their bodies and the straps are an ancient tradition that Moses received in Sinai. They were already explained by allusion and the sense of all this is in the secret of the thirteen divine attributes.",
                "Rabbi Yehuda said, Even if we came only for this secret, it would have sufficed. They said to him, Happy is your lot in the World to Come, for no secret is withheld from you. They said to him, We came before you, Master, to know the secret of the verse, \"Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah\" (Gen. 25:1).",
                "He said, the explanation of this verse is revealed by the friends versed in the Mishnah. When the soul enters its holy body, these words will be said of the wicked, who will be resurrected and make better their deeds. And the soul will grant them its precious splendor, so they will know, repent and have full merit again.",
                "When Solomon saw this, he wondered very much, and said, \"And so I saw the wicked buried, and come to their rest...gone from the holy place\" (Kohelet 8:10).",
                "Rabbi Abba quoted Rabbi Yochanan, saying it is written, \"Can the Kushite change his skin, or the leopard his spots?\" (Jer. 13:23), similarly the wicked who did not deserve to repent in this world and offer good deeds as sacrifices will never burn sacrifices in the World to Come. It is written, \"Then again Abraham took a wife\" and wanted to produce a soul for their bodies and bring them closer in repentance, as it is written, \"And the souls that they had made in Charan\" (Gen. 12:5). Rabbi Elazar said, Look at the verse, \"And she bore him Zimran, and Yokshan\" (Gen. 25:2). They did many evil deeds, until they were driven from the world, as it is written, \"And sent them away from his son Isaac\" (Ibid.). Of them it is written, \"And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake...\" (Daniel 12:2). Of the others, it is written, \"And they who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament\" (Ibid. 3). Rabbi Yehuda said, This is the meaning of the text indicating that it was called Abraham at one time, and is now called Isaac in his place, as it is written, \"And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that Elohim blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by Beer Lachai Roi (lit. 'the well of living and seeing')\" (Gen. 25:11). Through the knowledge of the living, the life of the world, he may know and conceive what he had not conceived in this world, as it is written, \"For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Hashem\" (Isaiah 11:9). (End of Midrash Hane'elam) ",
                "Rabbi Yitzchak opened with the verse, \"And the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to Elohim who gave it\" (Kohelet 12:7). Come and behold, When the Holy One, blessed be He, created Adam, He took the dust from the place of the Temple and built his body from the four directions of the world, each of which gave him strength. Later, He poured the spirit of life upon him, as it is written, \"And breathed into his nostrils the breath of life\" (Gen. 2:7). Then he stood up and knew that he comprised both high and low; he cleaved to Hashem and knew the supernal wisdom.",
                "Similarly, all people in the world are included from the upper and the lower. When all those who know how to properly sanctify themselves in this world beget a child, they draw on it a Holy Spirit from that place where all that is holy originates. These are called children to the Holy One, blessed be He, because their bodies were properly made in sanctity. He is also given a spirit from the holy supernal place, as he deserves. This has already been explained.",
                "Come and behold, When man is called to account for his deeds before leaving this world, there will be a day of reckoning, a day when both the soul and body give reckoning. The soul then leaves the body is separated from it, while the body returns to dust, and all return to the place from which it was taken. It has already been explained that everything will be stored before the Holy One, blessed be He, until the time when He resurrects the dead.",
                "The Holy One, blessed be He, will return that very body and that very soul to the world as before, and renew the face of the world. This is according to the verse, \"The dead men of your people shall live, my dead body shall arise\" (Isaiah 26:19).

Further, the text, \"As the appearance of the bow\" (Ezekiel 1:28), means green, white, and red. She (the Nukva) was three years old when he seized it, when he took Rivkah.

The hidden meaning is that Isaac came from the side of Abraham, supernal Chesed, who is kind to all creatures. And although he represented Severe Judgment, (he draws Chesed from Abraham). Rivkah also came from the side of Harsh Judgment (of Bethuel and Laban). Although she was herself of Weak Judgment and a thread of Chesed was attached to her, nevertheless she came from Severe Judgment. Thus, because Isaac was severe in his judgment and Rivkah was softer in her Judgment, she was as a rose among the thorns. If she were not of Weak Judgment, the world would not have been able to bear the Harsh Judgment of Isaac.

What offering did he sacrifice? A burnt offering. He sacrificed by studying the verses \"and Hashem was entreated of him\" (Ibid.), and \"So Hashem was entreated for the land\" (II Shmuel 24:25).

But Isaac prayed for his wife because he knew that his wife, and not he, was sterile. And although Isaac knew by the inner meaning of wisdom that Jacob was bound to come from him and produce the twelve tribes, he did not know whether this would be from this wife or from another.

Thus, he is the same as Isaac, who is of Harsh Judgment above, (in Holiness) and Esau, who issued from him, is the Harsh Judgment below. He resembled Isaac. And because each is drawn to his own kind, Isaac loved Esau more than Jacob, as it is written, \"And Isaac loved Esau, he relished his venison\" (Ibid. 28). Here it is written, \"For he relished his venison,\" which is similar to, \"wherefore it is said, 'like Nimrod the mighty hunter before Hashem'\" (Gen. 10:9).

This was as it ought to have been; by making Esau go after that serpent, so that he would be separated from Jacob, and thus share nothing with him in this world or in the World to Come. Thus we learn, \"he who comes to kill you, hasten to kill him first.\" It is written, \"in the womb he took his brother\" (Hoshea 12:4), which means that he lowered him down by the heel.

Thus, Abraham did not need to behave slyly, and neither did Isaac. For Esau, who was on the side of the serpent, had not yet come into the world. But Jacob, the landlord, had to stand against that serpent to prevent him from ruling and defiling the Temple of Jacob.

In addition, Esau said to Isaac, his father, \"For he has supplanted me these two times\" (Gen. 27:36). How can Jacob deceive Esau?

Of the verse, \"And Jacob cooked a pottage, and Esau came from the field, and he was faint,\" Rabbi Elazar explained that, \"And Jacob cooked,\" refers to the mourning for Abraham.

This is the goodness hidden for the Righteous in the future to come. Thus, \"And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son,\" refers to the generations of gladness and laughter that will exist at that time. Abraham's son is the soul worthy of it and is perfect in its ascent; \"Abraham begot Isaac,\" means that the soul sires joy and laughter in the world.",
                "Rabbi Yehuda said to Rabbi Chiya: We have learned that the Holy One, blessed be He, will prepare a feast for the righteous in the future. What is this feast? He replied, Before you went before these holy angels, the sages of the Mishnah, I heard what Rabbi Elazar said. It set my heart at peace. For Rabbi Elazar said that the feast of the Righteous in the future is as it is written, \"and they beheld the Elohim, and did eat and drink\" (Shemot 24:11). Here it is written, \"eat,\" ",
                "but Rabbi Elazar noted that in one place it is explained as, \"enjoy\" and in another, \"eat.\" What is the difference? He responded, Woe to the Righteous who do not have as much merit; they enjoy the splendor, though they do not understand everything. However, the Righteous who merit the divine splendor eat until they grasp it fully. Food and drink refers to this feast and eating alone. From whom do we know this? From Moses, as it is written, \"he did neither eat bread, nor drink water\" (Shemot 34:28). Why so? Because he ate another meal, which is the supernal splendor. The meal of the Righteous in the future will be in that manner.",
                "Rabbi Yehuda said that the feast of the Righteous in the future is to partake of His joy, according to the verse: \"the humble shall hear of it, and be glad\" (Tehilim 34:3). Rav Huna said that it is understood from the verse: \"But let all those that put their trust in You rejoice: let them ever shout for joy\" (Tehilim 5:12). Rabbi Yitzchak said, Both will occur in the future. We were taught by Rabbi Yosi that cellared wine with its grapes, from the six days of Creation, contains the ancient matters that were not revealed to man from the day the world was created. These are destined to be revealed to the Righteous in the future; this is assuredly their food and drink.",
                "In the name of Rabbi Shalom, Rabbi Yehuda said that if that is true, what about the Leviathan and the bull, as it is written, \"Surely the mountains bring him forth food\" (Iyov 40:20). Rabbi Yosi said that it is also written, \"On that day, Hashem with His sore and great and strong sword will punish Leviathan the flying serpent, and the Leviathan that crooked serpent; and He will slay the crocodile that is in the sea\" (Isaiah 27:1). This was said thrice, to hint at the kingdom. Rabbi Tanchum added that there is nothing to reveal in addition to what the wise men said. This is assuredly so.",
                "Rabbi Yitzchak said, I was present before Rabbi Yehoshua and asked him about this. I said that this feast of the Righteous that will be held in the future (was supposed to be of the Leviathan and the bull). If this is so, there is a contradiction, because Rabbi Elazar said that the feast of the Righteous in the future will be as it is written in the verse: \"and they beheld the Elohim, and did eat and drink.\" Rabbi Yehoshua said that Rabbi Elazar was correct. And so it was.",
                "Rabbi Yehoshua further stated the belief that the sages communicated to most of the people: that they are invited to this meal of the Leviathan and the wild bull, where they will drink of the good wine preserved from the time of the Creation. They came upon this verse: \"and you shall eat your bread to the full\" (Vayikra 26:5), and interpreted it thus. ",
                "Rabbi Zeira said, The Holy One, blessed be He, used all kinds of enticements to encourage the children of Yisrael to return to the good path. The greatest of them all was when He said to them, \"and you shall eat your bread to the full,\" or among the curses, the worst is, \"and you shall eat, and not be satisfied\" (Ibid. 26). Why so? Because it is written, \"Would we had died by the hand of Hashem in the land of Egypt\" (Shemot 16:3). ",
                "Rabbi Zeira said, This teaches us that for the sake of eating, they sacrificed their lives to die by their hands. When the Holy One, blessed be He, noticed their lust, He said to them: \"If you will hearken to keep the commandments, you shall eat your bread to the full', (Lev. 26:5) in order to appease their minds. In this manner, the wise men saw that the exile would continue. They relied on the verses in the Torah, and said that they would eat and be merry at the great feast that the Holy One, blessed be He, will hold for them. Therefore, most of the people in the world suffer this exile for the sake of that feast.",
                "Rabbi Yochanan said that we should not contradict this belief, but support the idea, because the Torah bears witness to it (Lev. 26:5). We already know the Faith of the Righteous and their desire from the verses, \"we will be glad and rejoice in You\" (Shir Hashirim 1:4), and not in eating, and \"we will praise your love more than wine\" (Vayikra 26:5). That feast, that they are destined for, we will partake of it too. This is the part of joy and laughter. \"And these are the generations of Isaac (lit. 'will laugh'),\" for the righteous will laugh in the future. \"Abraham begot Isaac,\" as it is the virtue of the soul that begets that laughter and joy in the world.",
                "\"And Isaac was forty years old.\" Rabbi Bo began in the name of Rabbi Yosi with the verse: \"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth\" (Shir Hashirim 1:2). With how many good qualities was the world created? We have learned that Rabbi Acha bar Jacob said that everything the Holy One, blessed be He, created in His worlds, outside of Himself, was in collaboration. Rabbi Acha asks, Is that so? Heaven forbid, for this will add dissension in the world. For if you say that it means that the angels, created as the Holy Spirit itself, have a blend in them, then their faces and ours are the same.",
                "Rabbi Abba said (this is true), and through this, dissension will increase in the world. For we learned in the Mishnah that all that the Holy One, blessed be He, did, He made as body and soul. One may argue that the angels have no bodies and cannot perform actions until the Holy Soul joins them, which is help from above.",
                "Rabbi Yosi said that the instant the Holy One blessed be He, resurrects the dead, all troubles will end, on the fortieth year (after the gathering of the exiles). It has been resolved by law \"Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed\" (Devarim 25:3). The journey of Yisrael in the desert (was finished) in the fortieth year. Forty years before the body is resurrected, the soul awaits it in the land of Yisrael. In the fortieth year, the bodies will rise from the dust. After forty days the rain stopped, this is the meaning of the verses \"And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights\" (Gen. 7:12), and \"it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened\" (Gen. 8:6). ",
                "Also, the time of the Redemption of Yisrael is during the fortieth year. During the fiftieth year, the world, which is Jubilee, will be populated. The return of the soul to the body occurs after forty years of waiting in the land of Yisrael. This is the meaning of, \"and Isaac was forty years old.\" That is, he was waiting for the body. ",
                "\"When he took Rivkah,\" who was put in the body prepared for him. Their passion and longing at that moment was for the splendor of the Shechinah only and to nourish of Her splendor. This is the meaning of the verse, \"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.\" Rabbi Abba said, \"Let him kiss me\" means let him nourish me. Their sole nourishment is the enjoyment and sustenance of the supernal splendor. Rabbi Yosi said that this is proven by the end of the verse, which reads, \"for your love is better than wine\" (Shir Hashirim 1:2).",
                "\"The daughter of Betu'el\" means the daughter (Heb. bat) of El. Rav Huna disagreed with this. He said that Betu'el is not (one of Malchut's name). I have been to distant lands, and heard there that this is the name of the bone of the spine. Of all the bones this one remains in the grave. It is called 'Betu'el the deceitful'. I asked about it, and they said that its shape resembles a head of a serpent, which is deceitful. And that more than any other bone in the body, this bone is deceitful.",
                "For we have learned that Rabbi Shimon asks, Why does this bone endure longer than the other bones? This is because it is deceitful and does not bear the taste of human food like the other bones. For that reason, it is stronger than all the other bones. And at the resurrection of the dead, the body will be built on this root. This is the meaning of the verse, \"the daughter of Betu'el the Arammian.\"",
                "We learned that Rabbi Shimon said, It is deceitful, and from a deceitful world, namely, from Paddan-Aram. Also, deceitful is the Evil Inclination. This is the meaning of the verse, \"the daughter of Betu'el the Arammian,\" who is the deceitful bone of the spine. The words, \"of Paddan-Aram,\" which means that he came from a deceitful (Heb. ramai) world, represent two deceivers, as we have learned that Paddana means a 'couple'. The two deceivers are \"the sister of Laban,\" the sister of the deceitful Evil Inclination. At first, when it was corrupted by sins in this world, it was called 'Lot'. In the future, when it will no longer be as corrupted, as someone who has washed and was cleansed of his impurities, and it will be called 'Laban' (lit. 'white'). Nevertheless, the Evil Inclination is not eliminated from the world.",
                "Come and hearken, we learned from the Mishnah that the two daughters of Lot symbolize the two forces of the body that arouse the Evil Inclination. Because it has bathed and is no longer so impure, it is called 'Laban'. And the two daughters are not completely negated, as it is written, \"And Laban had two daughters\" (Gen. 29:16). ",
                "Rabbi Yosi asks, Why are they there referred to as the firstborn and the younger, and here the elder and the younger? Rabbi Yosi said that they no longer have the power to do evil or arouse the Evil Inclination. This is understood from the verse, \"the name of the elder (lit. 'bigger') was Leah\" (Gen. 29:16), for she was weary (Heb. leah) from her wickedness and evil, while Rachel, \"the younger (lit. 'smaller'),\" did not have the power to incite. As it is written, \"and as a sheep (lit. 'Rachel') before her shearers is dumb\" (Isaiah 53:7). ",
                "Rav Huna said, This is the Evil Inclination. Its two daughters are different than they were at first. First it was Lot, cursed and corrupted; now it is Laban (lit. 'white'), who has been cleansed, not as cursed and corrupted as it was before. First its two daughters were strong; each had her individual strength. Now the name of the elder was Leah weary ('Leah') without power; weary without strength; Leah, fatigued from her former deeds. And the name of the younger was Rachel, as we have said, not as they were at first.",
                "Rabbi Acha bar Jacob, said, Come and behold. It is written, \"And Isaac entreated Hashem for his wife, because she was barren\" (Gen. 25:21). Rabbi Acha asks, Why is she barren? Because the Evil Inclination does not have its full strength in the world, the only fruition and multiplying comes through prayer. It is then written, \"and Hashem was entreated by him, and Rivkah his wife conceived.\" Once the Evil Inclination is aroused, there is procreation!",
                "Rabbi Yosi asks, What then is the difference between this world and the world at that time? The scripture also says that the Holy One, blessed be He, does it Himself. Rabbi Acha said, It is so. The Holy One, blessed be He, arouses (the Evil Inclination) for the specific purpose of mating, but not all the time, so that the Evil Inclination may be with men always, and they sin because of it. But it is aroused only for mating, and the arousal at the time of union will be caused by the Holy One, blessed be He. This is the meaning of the verse, \"and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh\" (Ezekiel 36:26). What is a heart of flesh? Rabbi Yehuda replies, It is a heart that would issue flesh and nothing else.",
                "Rabbi Yitzchak, the son of Rabbi Yosi, traveled from Cappadocia to Lod, where he met Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yitzchak asks him, Why are the companions, the sages of the Mishnah, not aroused in this matter of removing the Evil Inclination from the world, except at the time of mating? He replied, Upon your life! The world needs the Evil Inclination as much as it needs rain, because without the Evil Inclination there would not be the joy of study in the world. But it also would not be as corrupted as it was before, which caused sinning. This is the meaning of the verse, \"They shall not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain\" (Isaih 11:9). ",
                "Rabbi Shimon said, \"My holy mountain\" is the heart,\" the dwelling place of the Evil Inclination. Rabbi Eliezer said, A good heart is the foundation of the body and soul. For that reason, it is written, \"And you shall love Hashem your Elohim with all your heart\" (Devarim 6:5), for the heart is the essence of all!",
                "When Rav Kahana arrived, he said that this was said in the name of those versed in the Mishnah. The body is built upon the liver and the heart. As Rabbi Yehuda said, the heart and the liver are the leaders of the various organs of the body. The leader of the head is the brain, but there are two leaders in the body. The first is the liver and the second is the heart. This is the meaning of the verse, \"And the children struggled together within her.\" These are the two foundations of the body: the brain and the heart.",
                "Why did they struggle? Because the Evil Inclination was abolished from the heart. \"Struggled.\" It should have been written, 'And they were at peace'. Rav Huna explained that \"struggled\" means that the strength and vigor were broken. Rabbi Yehuda asks, What does the body say then? The body asks, 'If it be so, why am I thus?' and 'Why was I created?' Immediately, \"she went to inquire of Hashem\" (Gen. 25:22).",
                "\"And Hashem said to her, 'Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples'\" (Gen. 25:23). These are the two proud ones, the liver and the heart. Rabbi Yosi said that these are the brain and the heart, but Rabbi Yehuda said, The brain is not included in this, for it is written, \"in your womb (lit. 'belly'),\" and the brain is not in the belly, but in the head. \"And two peoples from your bowels and the elder (lit. 'great') shall serve the younger.\" This is the liver, which is great and big, and which serves the heart, as Rabbi Yehuda said, The liver receives the blood, and serves it to the heart!",
                "\"And the first came out red\" (Gen. 25:21). Rav Kahana explained that the liver is the first and is red. Why is it red? Because it is first to swallow the blood. Rabbi Eliezer asks, Why is it called 'first'? Because it is the first to swallow the blood from all the food; the first in blood but not in creation. And why is it that \"the great shall serve the younger?\" Because despite its being greater and bigger in size than the heart, it serves the heart. ",
                "Rabbi Abba then asks, What is the purpose of this text if not to teach the people in the world that though there will be perfection upon earth, the path and nature of the world will not change? Rabbi Yisa said, Come and behold. The liver hunts and has venison in its mouth, while the heart contemplates and is \"dwelling in tents\" (Ibid. 27). As it is written, \"And Jacob cooked pottage\" (Ibid. 29), while thinking deep thoughts and occupying himself with the Torah.",
                "\"And Jacob cooked pottage.\" In the name of Rabbi Acha, Rabbi Ba said that the nature of the world never changes. Come and behold, it is written, \"And Jacob cooked pottage (Heb. נָזִיד),\" as in the verse \"they dealt (Heb. זָדוּ)\" (Shemot 18:11), which was translated into Aramaic as \"they thought.\" It means that the heart thinks of and contemplates Torah, which represents the knowledge of its Creator. Thus, it is written, \"and Esau came from the field, and he was faint\" (Beresheet 25:29). It is the nature of the liver to go out hunting and swallow with its mouth. If it does not find any prey, it becomes tired and says to the heart, 'Before you think of the words of Torah, think of eating and drinking to nourish your body.' This is the meaning of the verse, \"and Esau said to Jacob 'Give me to swallow, I pray you, of that red pottage,'\" for it is my way to swallow the blood and transmit it to the other parts; \"for I am faint,\" without food and drink. ",
                "And the heart replies, 'Give me the first and choicest of whatever you swallow, give me your birthright,' this is the meaning of \"Sell me this day your birthright\" (Ibid. 31). That is, swear by your desire. As the heart contemplates food, the liver swallows. If it were not for the heart, longing and thinking about food, the liver and other organs would not be able to swallow. As Rabbi Yosi said, This is the way of slaves, who do not to eat before their master. Rabbi Yosi said, It is later written, \"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils\" (Beresheet 25:34). What are these lentils? They are round as a circle, and as the circle which revolves around the world does not deviate from its path, so man in that time will never deviate from his. Although there will yet be all that is good and precious and perfect, with all that, the worldly habit of eating and drinking will not change.",
                "We learned in the Mishnah that four winds blow in the world, and the Holy One, blessed be He, will raise one spirit to establish the body to include four spirits, as it is written, \"Come from the four winds, O breath\" (or: spirit) (Yechezkel 37:9). It is not written, 'in the four,' but, \"from the four winds,\" for it will be composed of the four of them. We learned that this spirit (or: wind) is the wind that procreates, the wind that eats and drinks. And there is no difference between this world and the days of Messiah's coming, save the delivery from servitude to the empires alone, and there is no difference between this world and the resurrection of the dead, save cleanliness and the attainment of knowledge. Rav Nachman added longevity.",
                "Rav Yosef asks if the days of Messiah's coming and the resurrection of the dead are the same. He responded, No, as we have learned that the building of the Temple precedes the gathering of the exiles, which precedes the resurrection of the dead. The resurrection of the dead is the last act of all. We know this from the verse, \"Hashem builds Jerusalem, He gathers together the outcasts of Yisrael. He heals the broken-hearted, and binds up their wounds\" (Tehilim 147:2-3). This refers to the resurrection of the dead, which is the healing of the brokenhearted and their dead. First He builds Jerusalem; then He gathers the outcasts of Yisrael; last of all, He heals the brokenhearted.",
                "We have learned that the gathering of the exiles preceded the raising of the dead by forty years, as it is written, \"And Isaac was forty years old.\" What is to be made of these forty years? According to Rav Kahana, Rabbi Broka said, How many troubles, how many wars waged against the children of Yisrael will there be from the gathering of the exiles until the resurrection of the dead. He who escapes them is happy, as it is written, \"And at that time your people shall be delivered, every one who shall be found written in the book\" (Daniel 12:1). Rabbi Yehuda said that this teaches us, \"Many shall purify themselves, and make themselves white, and be tried\" (Ibid. 10). Rabbi Yitzchak added, \"and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried\" (Zecharyah. 13:9). During these very days, there will be days when people will say, \"I have no pleasure in them\" (Kohelet 12:1). And from the time the troubles disappear until the resurrection of the dead there will be forty years.",
                "Rav Huna said, Come and behold, \"For the children of Yisrael walked forty years in the wilderness because they obeyed not the voice of Hashem\" (Joshua 5:6). In this verse, it is the same. Rabbi Yosef said, Everything that was said is the same, but for one thing. At the end of forty years, when the troubles pass away and the wicked are exterminated, the dead, the dwellers of the dust, shall live. Why? Because it is written, \"affliction shall not rise up the second time\" (Nehemiah 1:9). They had their fill with what they had. After the resurrection of the dead, the world will be settled, as it is written, \"on that day Hashem shall be One and His Name One\" (Zecharyah 14:9).",
                "Rabbi Elazar ben Arach was sitting and was exceedingly sad. Rabbi Yehoshua came before him and asks why the appearance of the candlelight of the world had become dark. He said, Great fear entered me, for I see how the companions versed in the Mishnah have responded on whom the spirit of saints dwells. They said that redemption will be in the sixth millennium. This was well said, but I see a longer time for the dwellers of the dust, who shall wait until the four hundred and eighth year of the sixth millennium, when they will rise. For this reason, the companions were stimulated by the verse that referred to the dwellers of the dust as the children of Chet, for Chet alludes to their rising after four hundred and eight (Heb. Chet Tav) years. As it is written, \"In the year of this Jubilee you shall return every man to his possession\" (Vayikra 25:13), when this (Heb. hazot) shall be finished. [The numerical value of Hazot is 5,408, as the Hei of Hazot alludes to the Hei (= 5) thousands; and Zot is 408 in numerical value]. Then, \"you shall return every man to his possession,\" means that the body will return to its soul, which is its possession and lot.",
                "(Further) Rabbi Yehoshua said, This time should not be difficult for you, as we have learned that there are three classes, the Completely Righteous, the Completely Wicked, and the Average. The completely righteous will rise with the resurrection of the dead of the land of Yisrael a few years earlier, namely, at the fortieth year after the gathering of the exiles. In the end, everybody will rise at the four hundred and eighth year of the sixth millennium. Who will merit this length of time? He who will keep the precepts at that time. For that reason, I am sad.",
                "He said to him, Rabbi, we have studied the verse, \"Let there be light,\" (Beresheet 1:2) which means let there be secret, because Light is the secret of redemption. [And the numerical value of Or ('light') is Raz ('secret'). Thus, the verse, \"let there be light,\" hints that the time of redemption will be a secret unknown to all men. Again, he said that through repentance everyone will rise from the dead early]. Rabbi Yehoshua said, Unless you said so, we would not have left an opening for those waiting daily for redemption, as it is written, \"a store of salvation\" (Isaiah 33:6). What is this \"salvation\"? It alludes to those who seek salvation daily. ",
                "What is the opinion of Rabbi Elazar? From the verse, \"And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake\" (Daniel 12:2). It is understood by, \"those who sleep,\" (only some will rise); these are the Righteous (who repented) while they were alive, who will rise early. By how many years do they precede other people? Rabbi Yehuda replied, By two hundred and ten years. Rabbi Yitzchak said, Resh Dalet Yud ('210') years, as it is written, \"Out of Jacob shall come (Heb. Yerd, Yud Resh Dalet) a ruler\" (Num. 24:19). This indicates that the Righteous precede other men by two hundred and ten years. Rav Nachman said, Precedence depends on how much the body is worn in the dust. Rabbi Yosi said to him, If this be true, then there are many resurrections. All revivals will occur at the same time, as was said in the vision, \"and the word was true, and for a long period ahead\" (Daniel 10:1). \"And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham\" (Gen. 26:1). Rabbi Abahu opened the discussion with the verse, \"While the king was reclining at his board, my spikenard sent forth its fragrance\" (Shir Hashirim 1:12). We learned that the righteous will pass through four eras and four times, each different from the other. During the first, knowledge will increase in the world, and the righteous will conceive what they have not conceived in this world. As we have learned from Rabbi Pinchas, in the future, the perception of the righteous will be greater than that of the ministering angels, as it is written, \"as the waters cover the sea\" (Isaiah 11:9). During the second time, you shall be occupied. (End of Midrash Hane'elam)",
                "\"And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, 'She is my sister\" (Gen. 26:7), that is, just like Abraham said. For the Shechinah was with Isaac and his wife, and he said of the Shechinah, as it is written, \"Say to wisdom, 'you are my sister'\" (Mishlei 7:4). Thus, he was strengthened and said, \"She is my sister.\" Abraham and Isaac deserved (to say this). This is assuredly so because of the verse \"My sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled\" (Shir Hashirim 5:2). (They) were therefore worthy of saying \"She is my sister.\" Thus, the Righteous were strengthened by the Holy One, blessed be He. \"And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time with Rivkah his wife\" (Beresheet 26:8): \"with (Heb. et) Rivkah his wife,\" precisely, which alludes to the Shechinah that was with Rivkah, because Et ('with'), as we know, is the name of the Shechinah. Another explanation asks if we could possibly conceive of Isaac performing his marital duties during the daytime. We have learned that the children of Yisrael are holy and abstain from cohabitation in the daytime. Therefore, how could Isaac, who was holy, cohabit during the day?",
                "Assuredly Abimelech was wise and looked at the wisdom of the stars, that is called a 'window', as it is written here, \"out at a window\" (Beresheet 26:8), and elsewhere, \"The mother of Sisra looked out at a window\" (Shoftim 5:28). As  there (refers to) astrology, so here to astrology. And he saw there that it was not as Isaac said, but that he surely was sporting with her, and she was his wife. Then, \"Abimelech called Isaac\" (Beresheet 26:9) Rabbi Yosi said that it would have befitted Abimelech to do this to Isaac, as he did to Abraham, were it not for the Holy One, blessed be He, who reproved him earlier.",
                "Come and behold, it is written, \"Because I thought, 'Surely the fear of Elohim is not in this place'\" (Beresheet 20:11). According to Rabbi Abba, this is the reason why he said, \"She is my sister.\" He wanted to cleave to the Shechinah, as it is written, \"Say to wisdom, you are my sister.\"Why? Because they had no faith in them, for if they had faith, he would not have needed that. He therefore said, \"Because I thought, 'Surely the fear of Elohim is not "
            ],
            [
                "is not in this place.\" The fear of Elohim is Faith.",
                "Rabbi Elazar said that this is because the Shechinah does not live outside the Holy Land. Therefore, there is no fear of Elohim in this place. This is not Her place, and She does not dwell here. And Isaac was strengthened by the faith when he saw the Shechinah dwelling in his wife. \"And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, 'He that touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death'\" (Beresheet 26:11). Come and behold, how long had the Holy One, blessed be He, refrained from avenging the wicked, for as a result of the good Abimelech did with the first Patriarchs, the children of Yisrael did not rule over the Philistines until generations later. Abimelech did well to act properly toward Isaac, as he said (to Abraham), \"Behold, my land is before you, dwell where it pleases you\" (Beresheet 20:15). ",
                "Rabbi Yehuda said, Woe to the wicked, whose generosity is not complete. Come and behold, Efron first said, \"my lord, hear me, the field I give you, and the cave that is in it\" (Beresheet 23:11). Later he said, \"four hundred shekels\" (Ibid. 14), and then, \"and Abraham weighed to Efron current money with the merchant\" (Ibid. 16). Here too, it is written at first \"Behold, my land is before you,\". Then he said (to Isaac), \"Go from us; for you are much mightier than we\" (Beresheet 26:16). Rabbi Elazar said to him, This is the benevolence Abimelech had for Isaac. He took nothing from him and sent him away with his money and possessions. Then, he went after him to make a covenant with him.",

This is as it should be, for they are the supernal mystery. For the Holy One, blessed be He, dwells with the man who is crowned by Tefilin and clothed with the fringes. All is in the secret of high Faith.",

The fear of his Master is removed from him, and his prayer is no proper prayer. For this reason, the fathers were strengthened by the supreme faith, since within the supernal well dwells whole faith. \"And he removed from there, and dug another well...\" (Beresheet 26:22). Rabbi Chiya opened the discussion with the verse, \"and Hashem shall guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in drought, and make strong your bones\" (Yeshayah 58:11). This verse had already been explained, but by this verse the faithful were strengthened, for it promises them the World to Come. \"And Hashem shall guide you continually\" in this world and the World to Come. \"And Hashem shall guide you.\" Because he said, \"And Hashem shall guide you,\" why add the word \"continually (Heb. תָּמִיד)?\" For this hints at the daily offering (lit. 'continue') made at dusk that receives its strength from underneath Yitzchak's arm. How do we know that? From David, as it is written, \"He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake\" (Tehilim 23:3). Just as the word \"leads,\" spoken by David, means the illumination of the left, as it is written, \"in the paths of Righteousness,\" which is a name of the Nukva when she shines from the left, here too when it says \"guide,\" it alludes to the illumination of the left. \"And satisfy your soul in drought (also: brightness)\" (Yeshayah 58:11) refers to the shining lamp that all the souls delight in and take pleasure in beholding. The verses ends, \"and make strong your bones\" (Ibid.). The end does not suit the beginning, for if the soul of the righteous (is satisfied), why does it now say \"and make strong your bones,\"? This has already been explained. It refers to the resurrection of the dead, the fact that the Holy One blessed be He, will revive the dead and fix man's bones as they were at first, in a whole body. And Light will be added from the shining lamp so the soul will be illuminated together with the body in a complete whole. This way, it refers to the soul of the Righteous, to which the Holy One, blessed be He, will give a whole body in which to be clothed for eternity.",

For this reason, Rivkah offered \"two kids of the goats,\" one for the supernal grade and one to subjugate the grade of Esau, so he would not rule over Jacob. Thus, there were two kids of the goats. From both, Isaac tasted and ate. It is written, \"and he brought him wine, and he drank\" (Beresheet 27: 25), (not 'he served him'). By this he hints that he served him wine from afar. According to Rabbi Elazar, this means that he brought him wine in which there is complete joy, to gladden Isaac, for he needed cheering, as the side of the Levites needs cheering, Therefore, \"he brought him wine, and he drank.\" \"And Rivkah took the best clothes of her eldest son Esau\" (Beresheet 27:15).

And Esau went into the field, where he fought with and killed Nimrod, removing the garments from him. This is the meaning of \"and Esau came from the field, and he was faint\" (Beresheet 25:29). It has already been explained why it is here written, \"And he was faint,\" and elsewhere, \"for my soul faints before the slayers\" (Yirmeyah 4:31). These are analogous.

Come and behold, Adam's beauty is a mystery on which supernal faith stems. Of this, the scripture says \"And let the beauty of Adonai our Elohim be upon us\" (Tehilim 90:17).

Another explanation is that once Jacob wore them, they emitted an aroma. As long as Isaac did not smell the aroma of the garments, he did not bless him. But then, he knew that the wearer was worthy of being blessed. For if he did not deserve to be blessed, no holy aroma would be put forth.

This is the meaning of the verse, \"And the house of Jacob shall be fire, and the house of Joseph flame, and the house of Esau for stubble\" (Ovadyah 1:8), for Esau will lose everything, and Jacob will inherit both worlds, this world and the World to Come, namely, the upper heaven and earth. It goes without saying that even before the advent of Messiah, Jacob receives blessings from the lower heaven and earth, that is, when the Temple existed, on Shabbatot and holidays and also through prayers. But because they are not constant, it is not considered receiving. But in the future it shall be permanent.",

The kingdom that Esau received in this world shall be for the Holy One, blessed be He, alone. Did this kingdom not already belong to the Holy One, blessed be He? Although the Holy One, blessed be He, rules above and below, He lets other peoples rule, giving each a part and inheritance in this world for their use. At that time He will take the kingdom from them all, and it will be solely His, as it is written, \"And Hashem shall be king over all the earth, on that day Hashem shall be One, and His name One\" (Zecharyah 14:9). \"And Jacob was scarce gone out (lit.

Isaac said the blessings and the Shechinah approved. Therefore, when Jacob went out, the Shechinah went out with him. This is the hidden meaning of the phrase \"and Jacob went out going,\" which mentions two goings out together. \"Esau his brother came in from his hunting\" (Ibid.). Why is it written \"his hunting\", and not \"the hunting.\" It is Esau's hunting that contains no blessing. And the Holy Spirit cried out, \"Do not eat the bread of him who has an evil eye\" (Mishlei 23:6).",
                "\"And he also had made savory food...Let my father arise\" (Beresheet 27:31). His speech was impertinent, rough, and impolite. Come and behold the difference between Jacob and Esau. Jacob talked to his father humbly, with humility. It is written, \"And he came to his father, and said, My father\" (Ibid. 18). The difference between the language of Esau and Jacob is that Jacob did not want to frighten him. Thus, he spoke humbly, saying \"arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my venison.\" Esau, however, said \"Let my father arise,\" as if he was not speaking to him.",

Why is \"very much\" used to describe \"trembled.\"?  Isaac never felt such fear and terror during his life. Even when he was strapped upon the altar and saw the knife, he did not tremble as when Esau entered and brought Gehenom with him. Then he said, \"Before you came, and have blessed him? Moreover, he shall be blessed.\" For I saw the Shechinah approving those blessings.",
                "There is another explanation, Isaac said, \"And has blessed him.\" A voice came forth, saying \"moreover, he shall be blessed.\" Isaac wanted to curse Jacob, but the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, Isaac, it is you whom you curse, for you have said to him \"cursed be those that curse you, and blessed be those that bless you\" (Beresheet 27:29).",

And he blessed him and approved of the blessings, and raised him above his head. From where do we know this? From the verse, \"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let you go, unless you bless me\" (Beresheet 32:27). It is written, \"And he said, Let me go\" because Jacob had seized him. How can a man, flesh and blood, take hold of an angel, which is pure spirit, as it is written, \"who makes the winds His messengers; the flames of fire His ministers\" (Tehilim 104:4)?",

And of the angels, when they descended, it is written, \"and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate\" (Beresheet 18:8). Here also, the descending angel could not struggle with Jacob unless clothed in a body, as is done in this world. Therefore Jacob wrestled with him the whole night. But if he were not clothed (in human form), Jacob could not have wrestled with him.",
                "Come and behold, Because of this those (of the Other Side) dominate only during the night, assuredly this is why Esau rules only in exile, which is night. Hence, he wrestled and struggled with Jacob during the night. But when morning came, the strength of the angel failed, and he did not prevail. Then Jacob got stronger, as the dominion of Jacob is during the day.",

Hence it is not written \"against Elohim,\" but rather \"with Elohim,\" in a union.",
                "Another explanation of \"And he said\" has the same meaning as \"and He said, If you will diligently hearken to the voice of Hashem your Elohim\" (Shemot 15:26). Here too \"And he said\" (means) \"Your name shall be called no more 'Jacob', but Israel.\" Then was Jacob crowned by his grade, by which he will include all the Patriarchs. It is written, \"And he blessed him there\" (Beresheet 32:30). It means that he acknowledged all the blessings with which his father blessed him.",
                "Rabbi Shimon began the discourse with the verse, \"When a man's ways please Hashem, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him\" (Mishlei 16:7). Come and behold, Man has much to do if he wants to improve his behavior toward the Holy One, blessed be He, by keeping the precepts of the Torah. For we have learned that assuredly man has two angels, who are messengers that join him from above. One is on his right and the other on his left. They observe man in everything he does. They are called 'the Good Inclination' and 'the Evil Inclination'.",

As a result, the Evil Inclination becomes a slave to the Good Inclination. When a man wishes to be defiled, the Evil Inclination is strengthened and overpowers the Good Inclination. This has already been explained. Assuredly, when man wishes to be purified, he has much to overcome. When the Good Inclination is strengthened, then \"He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.\" For the Evil Inclination is submissive to the Good Inclination. Of this Solomon said, \"Better is he that is lightly esteemed, and has a servant\" (Mishlei 12:9). The servant is the Evil Inclination.

Because Samael made peace with Jacob and acknowledged all his blessings, Esau made peace with Jacob. Yet, as long as Jacob did not make peace with him, the minister in charge of Esau, then Esau did not make peace with him. This is because strength below always depends on strength above.

In the same manner, the verse \"surely now we had returned this (Heb. zeh) second time\" (Beresheet 43:10), that two matters are in one: 1) we would have returned (Heb. shavnu) by now and not be put to shame (Heb. boshnu) by that man, and 2) we would have been back already.

This means that there is no one present who gives consent, \"What shall I do now for you, my son.\" He then blessed him in this world.

And I have seen your brother walking the path of peace. He added \"my son,\" for surely I brought all this upon you, as you are my son. Therefore \"by your sword shall you live, and you shall serve your brother.\" This has not yet happened, for Esau is not yet a servant of Jacob. This is because Jacob has no need for him now.

Rabbi Chiya quoted the verse, \"It is time to act for Hashem\" (Tehilim 119:126), while Rabbi Yosi began with the verse, \"She opened her mouth with wisdom; and on her tongue is a Torah of steadfast love\" (Prov. 31:6). \"She opened her mouth with wisdom\" alludes to the Congregation of Yisrael; \"and on her tongue is a Torah of steadfast love\" refers to Yisrael, who are the tongue of the Torah, which is on their lips day and night. \"She opened her mouth with wisdom.\" This is the letter Bet of Beresheet (Eng. 'In the beginning'). It is the secret of the Nukva, called 'house' (Heb. bayit). \"And on her tongue is a Torah of steadfast love (lit. 'Chesed')\" refers to Abraham, with which He created the world, and he speaks always. The letter Bet is closed on one side and open on the other. It is closed on one side, as it is written, \"and you shall see My back\" (Shemot 33:23). On the other side Bet is open, so that its face will shine upward. It is also open to receive from above, as a foyer to receive. For that reason, the letter Bet stands at the beginning of the Torah.  Another explanation for the verse, \"She opened her mouth with wisdom,\" which assuredly opens with wisdom, as it is written, \"In the beginning Elohim created\" (Beresheet 1:1),  in the Aramaic translation. Of the verse, \"And on her tongue is a Torah of steadfast love (lit. 'Chesed'),\" the Torah later reads, \"And Elohim said, Let there be light, and there was light\" (Ibid. 3).",
                "\"She opened her mouth with wisdom,\" is that it is the first Hei of the holy name Yud Hei Vav Hei, which is Binah, in which everything is contained.

When (Binah) started to spread together with Chochmah that cleaved to it and was clothed in it, it issued a sound, which is \"a Torah of Chesed.\"",

The man came to Charan with great wealth and camels loaded with many gifts to lavish, yet he did not say to Betu'el and Laban, that he is Abraham's friend, or any other man, who came at Abraham's request, but when he started his speech, it is written, \"And he said, I am Abraham's servant\" (Beresheet 24:34). Later, he repeated 'my master' (several times). Because he respected Abraham with honor and kindness, they were patient with him for some time.",
                "Such is Esau; By right of that honor that he showed to his father, the Holy One, blessed be He, was forbearing with him when he ruled this world. And these are the tears that Yisrael shed under his yoke, until Yisrael will return to the Holy One, blessed be He, with crying in tears and weeping, as it is written, \"They shall come with weeping...\" (Jer. 31:8) and then, \"And liberators shall ascend upon mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esau; and the kingdom shall be Hashem's\" (Ovadyah 1:21). Blessed be Hashem for ever and ever. Amen and Amen. [This is the end of Parshat Toldot].",
                "\"And Jacob went out from Beer-Sheva, and went toward Charan\" (Gen. 28:10). Rabbi Chiya opened the discussion with the verse, \"The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to its place where it rises again\" (Kohelet 1:5). This verse has been explained. But the phrase, \"the sun also rises,\" refers to Jacob when he was in Beer-Sheva. The phrase, \"and the sun goes down,\" refers to Jacob when he went to Charan, as it is written, \"And tarried there all night, for the sun was set\" (Beresheet 28:11). The passage, \"and hastens to its place "

                "And come and behold, although the sun illuminates the whole world, it travels in only two directions, as it is written, \"goes towards the south, and veers to the north\" (Kohelet 1:6), for south is the Right and north is the Left. And the sun rises every day from the east side, and travels toward the south side. It then veers to the north side. And from the north it veers toward the west. Then the sun moves to the west, where it sets. The sun rises in the east, as it is written, \"And Jacob went out from Beer-Sheva,\". The sun goes west as it is written, \"And went toward Charan.\" This teaches us that the illumination alluded to in the text, \"And Jacob went out,\" is a complete illumination comprising the two Columns, Right and Left, which is the secret of Chochmah and Chassadim combined.",
                "3. Rabbi Shimon said that Jacob went out of the ambit of the Land of Yisrael, as it is written, \"And Jacob went out from Beer-Sheva,\" which is the Nukva in its entirety, called 'Beer-Sheva', and called the 'Land of Yisrael'. And he went to another domain, as it is written, \"And went toward Charan,\" (outside the) Land of Yisrael, (where the Other Side rules). Jacob came from the east, as it is written, \"And Jacob went out from Beer-Sheva.\" This means that during the Sabbatical year, Jacob took the shining light from the supernal depth (Binah) and traveled west. \"and went toward Charan,\" a place of Judgment and wrath (Heb. charon). According to Rabbi Yosi, this verse refers to the exile. For at first, the light descended from the supernal depth, and Jacob took it with him and went to (pour it) on Beer-Sheva. This is, \"the well that the princes dug out\" (Num. 21:18), here Jacob received his illumination, and perfected the well (Heb. beer) in all its wholeness. During the days of exile, he wanders from Beer-Sheva to Charan, as written, \"and went toward Charan that is, to fierce indignation (Heb. Charon). What is the fierce indignation of the Holy One, blessed be He? It is the evil grade, the land of the dominion of another.",
                "Rabbi Chiya said that when the sun,  goes west the west represents the throne of the sun, the place upon which the sun dwells. This is the meaning of the verse, \"and hastens to its place where it rises again,\" for it goes to that place to shine upon it. It takes all the lights and gathers them to itself.",
                "So we have learned that the Holy One, blessed be He puts on Tefilin which means He takes all the supernal crowns. What are they? They are the secret of the supernal Abba and supernal Imma; they are the Mochin of Chochmah and Binah, the secret of the two passages, \"Kadesh (sanctify to me)\" (Devarim 11:13) and \"Vehayah Ki Yeviacha (and it shall be when Hashem shall bring you)\" (Shmot 13:11-16). Kadesh is the Mochin of the supernal Abba, which is Chochmah. Vehayah Ki Yeviacha is the Mochin of the Supernal Imma, Binah. They are the head Tefilin, the first three Sefirot of the Tefilin, the secret of Yud-Hei, called 'head'. Thus, we have learned that the High Priest takes the first (lit. 'in the head'). After he took Abba and Imma, he received from the right and left. So it is found that he took all the Mochin, the Chochmah, Binah, Chesed, and Gevurah, the secret of the four passages called the 'Tefilin of the Holy One, blessed be He.'",

Therefore, Beer-Sheva is a Jubilee, and Beer-Sheva is the Sabbatical year, which is the Nukva. This means that the lights of Binah and the Nukva are equal, and both are called 'Beer-Sheva'. Because this sun illuminates only from the Jubilee the scripture reads, \"And Jacob went out from Beer-Sheva,\" which is Binah, also called 'Beer-Sheva', \"and went toward Charan,\" the west, which is the Sabbatical year."

When man is born, the Evil Inclination enters with him and constantly denounces him, as it is written, \"sin crouches at the door\" (Beresheet 4:7). What is meant by \"sin crouches\"? It refers to the Evil Inclination. \"at the door\" means at the opening of the womb at a person's birth.",

But in another place, it is written, \"For He shall give His angels charge over you,\" namely, many angels, whereas here only one is mentioned, as it is written, \"The angel of Hashem encamps.\"  The verse, \"For He shall give His angels charge over you,\" refers to angels in general, but the verse, \"The angel of Hashem,\" refers to the Shechinah, as it is written, \"And the angel of Hashem appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush\" (Shemot 3:2). just as it refers to the Shechinah in the first verse, so The angel mentioned here also points to the Shechinah. And so, \"the angel of Hashem encamps round about those who fear Him,\" to encircle them in every direction so as to deliver them.

Rabbi Yehuda replies, Because he led himself into danger by remaining alone at night and saw clearly the danger he was in, the angels deserted him, for they came to guard him only from unseen dangers. Then, before entering into danger, he stated, \"I am unworthy of the least of all the mercies and all the truth, which You have shown Your servant\" (Ibid. 11).

Bread is the Shechinah in both verses. Faith is the Shechinah, so lacking bread means lacking faith.",
                "Another interpretation of, \"Better is one lightly esteemed\" is that it refers to Jacob, who humbled himself before Esau so that Esau should later become his servant. By controlling him, he fulfilled the meaning of the verse, \"Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you\" (Beresheet 27:29). It was not yet time for Jacob to rule over Esau. Jacob left this to happen at a later time, for he was lowly then. Later, however, the one who pranks himself will become his servant, and then he will \"lack bread.\" This refers to Esau, who will become Jacob's servant, who was given \"plenty of corn and wine\" (Ibid. 28).",
                "Come and behold, Jacob knew that he needed him now. Therefore, he appeared as if he was lightly esteemed. By doing so, he showed more wisdom and guile than he had ever shown against Esau. Had Esau been aware of this wisdom, he would have killed himself rather then coming to this.

At once Jacob introduced himself as Esau's servant, so that Esau would not take heed of the blessings that his father bestowed on him. Jacob put them aside for the end of days.",

A rumor circulated that no one had ever escaped the clutches of Laban of Aram, as he was well versed in sorcery and wizardry. He was also the father of Beor, who in turn was the father of Bilaam. As it is written, \"Bilaam the son of Beor the sorcerer\" (Joshua 13:22). Yet although Laban was the greatest practitioner of sorcery and wizardry, he could not overcome Jacob, whom he attempted to annihilate in several ways, as it is written, \"An Aramian wanted to destroy my father\" (Devarim 26:5). And so he sent him the message, \"I have sojourned with Laban,\" to make him aware of his power.",

Because everyone feared Laban and his sorcery, the first words that Jacob sent Esau were, \"I have sojourned with Laban.\" In case Esau thought it was for a short period, perhaps a month or a year, Jacob advised, \"and stayed there until now\" twenty years did I stay with him.",

                "This is because the Holy One, blessed be He, desires no other people or tongue to make use of His glory, but His holy children alone, that is, Yisrael, who are called 'children to Hashem'. He said, \"you shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and you shall be holy\" (Vayikra 11:44), which means that those who are holy shall use holy things. And only Yisrael are holy, as it is written, \"For you are a holy people\" (Devarim 14:2); you, and no other people, are holy.",
                "Those who are unholy find that defilement awaits them. Of them, the scripture says, \"he is unclean, he shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his habitation be\" (Vayikra 13:46), that is, away from holiness. The impure touches on the impure, as it is written, \"and shall cry, unclean, unclean\" (Ibid. 45), which means that whoever is unclean cries to the unclean; one seeks out one's own kind.",
                "Rabbi Yitzchak said, Is it becoming for Jacob, who was holy, to say that he was defiled by Laban and his magic? Could it  possibly be considered a credit to him to say, \"I have sojourned with Laban?\" Despite what Rabbi Yehuda said, that everything follows its own kind, Rabbi Yosi gave another explanation for the difficulty in that verse. It is written, \"I am Esau your firstborn\" (Beresheet 27:19). Here, we should ask, is it becoming to a righteous man such as Jacob to change his name to that of an impure one? The explanation is that under the \"I,\" there is a tonal pause. Below the \"I\" is written the (tone) Pashta, whereas below \"Esau, your firstborn,\" is found the (tone) Zakef Katon, whose tone separates the word \"I\" from \"Esau your firstborn.\" What he actually said was \"I am who I am, though Esau is your firstborn,\" as has already been explained.",
                "Here also it is written, \"I have oxen and donkeys,\" that is, do not pay attention to the blessing my father bestowed on me, to think that it was fulfilled in me. He blessed me, \"be lord over your brethren, and let your mother's sons bow down to you\" (Beresheet 27:29). Hence, I say to you, \"to my master Esau; Your servant Jacob.\" He blessed me with \"plenty of corn and wine,\" yet I have no stock of these; \"I have oxen, and donkeys, flocks and menservants,\" as a shepherd in the field. He blessed me with \"the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth,\" yet instead I \"have sojourned with Laban,\" a sojourner without even a house, let alone \"the fatness of the earth.\" The last was not fulfilled in me, as I have no land. I have only sojourned with Laban. He said all this so that Esau would not be jealous of him, on account of the blessings he received, and bring accusations against him. ",
                "Rabbi Abba said, It is written that Jacob was \"a plain man, dwelling in tents\" (Beresheet 25:27). He was called \"a plain man,\" because his abode was in two supernal temples, Binah and Malchut, the secret of the tent of Rachel and the tent of Leah. He reconciles both sides, which meant that he balanced and perfected the Right and Left Columns. Do not conclude from the verse, \"I have sojourned with Laban,\" that he was contaminated by the divination of Laban. But in light of Rabbi Yehuda's observation that one seeks out one's own kind, according to the question of Rabbi Yitzchak, the explanation for, \"I have sojourned with Laban,\" is that he was wholeheartedly thankful for the grace and truth shown him by the Holy One, blessed be He. For everybody knows that although no one can be saved from Laban's accusations, the Holy One, blessed be He, rescued me from his hands when Laban wanted to destroy me. This is what he meant by the verse, \"I have sojourned with Laban.\" Furthermore, he said all this so that Esau would not envy him his blessings, but rather think that they were not fulfilled in him. Thus, Esau would not harbor any hate for him as Rabbi Yosi explained. Of this, the scripture says, \"for the ways of Hashem are right\" (Hoshea 14:10), and, \"You shall be perfect with Hashem your Elohim\"(Devarim 18:13).",
                "\"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: 'We came to your brother Esau, and he is also coming to meet you, and four hundred men with him'\" (Beresheet 32:7). He asks, After saying, \"We came to your brother,\" do we not know they referred to Esau, as he had no other brothers? He answers, \"We came to your brother\" means that he did not repent and walk the path of righteousness, as may be thought, but remained the evil Esau as before. \"and he is also coming to meet you...\" does not mean, as you may say, by himself, but rather he has \"four hundred men with him.\"",
                "Why was all this specified? Because the Holy One, blessed be He, always longs for the prayers of the righteous and adorns Himself with them. As we have already said, the angel in charge of the prayers of Yisrael, whose name is Sandalphon, receives all their prayers and weaves them into a crown for the Life of the Worlds. The Holy One, blessed be He, desires the prayers of the righteous all the more; they become a crown with which to adorn the Holy One, blessed be He. You may wonder why Jacob was fearful, since camps of holy angels accompanied him. He was fearful because the righteous do not rely on their merit, but on their prayers and supplications before their Master.",

It consists of several sides, the right side, the left, and the middle, as Chassadim are drawn from the right, Gevurot from the left, and Mercy from the middle. Because it comprises several aspects, it is woven into a wreath and put on the head of the righteous One, the Life of the Worlds that is, Yesod, which gives salvation to the Nukva and from Her, to the whole congregation. But a solitary prayer does not include all the sides; rather, it contains only one aspect. One can only ask for Chassadim, Gevurot, or Mercy. Therefore, the solitary prayer is not prepared and accepted as is that of the congregation; It is not included within all the three Columns as is the prayer of the congregation. Come and behold, Jacob included all three Columns, being the Chariot of the Central Column, which includes both. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, desired his prayer perfected by all three Columns. It is therefore written, \"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed.\" The Holy One, blessed be He, did all that to encourage Jacob to pray, for He craved his prayer.",

Why is it said that \"Hashem will command His grace in the daytime?\" Because \"in the night His song shall be with me.\" Hence the verse, \"Hashem takes pleasure (in) those who fear Him,\" uses the particle Et instead of \"in,\" as one who pleases another and wishes to be at peace with him.

Jacob arrived at the prophecy of \"and...lived\" only in Egypt. It was an excellent prophecy, the like of which was never prophesied before. None of the prophets was worthy of it except for him and Moses. It is written of Moses, \"For no man shall see Me, and live\" (Shemot 33:20).

For the name Jacob indicates smallness, and the name Israel indicates Mochin of greatness, while \"and lived\" alludes to the Light of Chayah, which is the Mochin of greatness. It should have said, 'And Israel lived.' How do we know that Yisrael indicates Mochin of Greatness? From the verse, \"Yisrael is holy to Hashem\" (Jer. 2:3), (Holy is an allusion to greatness). It also says, \"Israel is My son, My firstborn\" (Shemot 4:22), firstborn being an allusion to greatness.

Who are the everlasting hills? These are the two matriarchs, females, Jubilee and Sabbatical year. Binah is called Yovel (Eng. Jubilee) and Malchut Shmitah (Eng. Sabbatical year), and both are called \"everlasting hills (lit. 'hills of the world').\"  'World' as you say \"from everlasting to everlasting (lit.

This world was created with Judgment and is maintained on Judgment. This is the meaning of, \"In the beginning Elohim created\" (Beresheet 1:1). The reason is so that people would conduct themselves according to judgment (law) and would not digress from the path. ",

See the strength of Moses, as soon as he started prophesying, his spirit did not rest at this place. He said, \"Adonai, why have You dealt ill with this people? why is it that You have sent me? for since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name he has done evil to this people; neither have You delivered your people at all\" (Ibid. 22-23).

She started to complain, but as soon as she started speaking, the king, who was present, took over the matter, and she became silent and stopped speaking. The king said, Don't you know that I am the king, and that it is in my presence that you spoke these words? Similarly, so to speak, with Moses, \"And Moses returned to Hashem and said 'Adonai, why have You dealt ill?'\" Immediately \"Elohim spoke to Moses,\" because the king's daughter started to complain. Immediately, the King took up the complaint, \"And said to him 'I am Hashem.'\" Did you not know that I am King, and it is in My presence that you spoke these words? ",

This is like a king who had an unmarried daughter, and also a beloved friend. When the king wanted to speak with his beloved friend, he used to send his daughter to speak to him and thus the king spoke to him through his daughter. The time has come for his daughter to marry. On the day she married, the king said to her, precious queen, until now I spoke through you to whomever I wished to. From now on, I will tell your husband and he will speak with whomever it is necessary. After some time, the husband said harsh words to her in the king's presence. Before she started to talk, the king took the cause and said to him, am I not the king? Until this day no person spoke to me except through my daughter.

Afterwards, the whole world is watered from it. \"The world, and they that dwell in it\" refers to the rest of the lands that drink from it. How do we know this?

And we have already established that Moses took the celestial house and forsook the terrestrial house. Therefore, it is written of Jacob: \"By the name of El Shadai,\", by the name El Shadai did the Holy One, blessed be He, speak to him and no more. \"But by My name, Hashem, I was not known to them,\" to speak to them in this level, which is superior.

But notwithstanding, he did not merit uniting with it (Malchut) like Moses did, as earlier mentioned. \"And I have also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan\" (Shemot 6:4). This is because they were circumcised. For all who are circumcised inherit the land. The Torah says, \"To give them the land of Canaan.\" For the land is inherited only by a righteous person and everyone who is circumcised is called righteous, as is written, \"Your people also shall be all righteous, they shall inherit the land forever\" (Isaiah 60:21). Everyone who is circumcised and observes the sign of the covenant is called righteous. Come and learn this from Joseph, who was not called righteous in his life until he observed that covenant, the sign of the holy covenant. Once he observed it, he was called righteous, namely, Joseph the righteous. ",

Rabbi Elazar said, in the passage, \"And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob...\" (Shemot 6:3), why is \"And I appeared\" stated? It should state 'And I spoke.' He said to him, Elazar my son, this is a very high secret. ",

And they are the ones that appeared to the patriarchs in order to know and perceive these hidden that appeared from within those that did not illuminate.

Therefore, \"And I appeared\" in the mirror that does not illuminate, which is revealed. Sight is mentioned in relation to it. In relation to the illuminating mirror, which is concealed, knowledge is mentioned, as is written, \"I was not known.\" Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba approached and kissed the hands of Rashbi.

Did not David know Naval to be evil, to have said of him, \"כֹּה to the living?\" That day was the holy day of Rosh Hashanah (the New Year) and the Holy One, blessed be He, was sitting in judgment over the world. For the Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"And you shall say כֹּה to the living\" in order to attach 'כֹּה' to the 'living', from which all life comes. \"Peace be both to you.\" What is \"both to you?\" \"Both to you\" refers to the Holy One, blessed be He, in order to connect the link of Faith, as is proper.

How obtuse are people who do not know and do not observe why they are in the world.

These four directions joined in four aspects, which are the elements, fire, air, water and earth, and the four directions joined the four elements.

Fire to the north side. Air is to the east side. Water is to the south side. Earth is to the west. And these four - fire, air, water and earth are connected to the four - north, south, east and west.

The Holy One of Blessing didn't give Torah to Yisrael until the faithful could be distinguished from those without faith, who didn't desire Torah.  And how were they distinguished?  Through the mannah!  As it says, (Shmot 16:4), \"that I may thus test them [to see whether they will follow My instructions or not\"].  All those found to be faithful, the Holy One of Blessing marks them, with the mark of the crown of Hesed, as it says (Tehillim 147:11), \"those who rely on ha-Shem's Hesed.\"  It is because of this that \"I may test them.\"  All those not found to be faithful, this supernal crown will be removed from them.  For I proclaimed the mannah, saying (Mishlei 13:25), \"[The righteous man eats to his heart’s content,] but the belly of the wicked is empty.\"  With all this, (Shmot 16:18) \"the one who had gathered much had no excess, and the one who had gathered little had no deficiency; [they had gathered as much as they needed to eat.]\"",
                "It was taught, at the time Yisrael was completed below, so it was above, as it has been established by what it written (Shmot 15:27), \"And they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; [and they encamped there beside the water.]\"  The holy tree was strengthened, with twelve boundaries, on the four sides of the world, and it was strengthened with seventy branches, all of them corresponding to what's above.",
                "At that time, the holy dew dripped down, from the ancient secret place, filling the top of the Ze'ir Anpin, the place that is called heaven.  From that dew of the supernal holy light, the manna continued to descend below.  When it descended, it spread out as frosted layers, and solidified below.  This is what is written (Shmot 16:14), \"[When the fall of dew lifted, there, over the surface of the wilderness, lay a fine and flaky substance,] as fine as frost on the ground.\" ",
                "All of these faithful ones went out and gathered [the manna] and made blessing upon the holy name.  That manna brought out the scents of all the spices that are in Gan Eden, for through [the Garden] it had descended below.  All possibilities before them, they could taste whatever they desired, for here it had that taste.  And they blessed the supreme holy sovereign.  ",

And what is written of them [in the rest of the verse]?  \"They would ground [the manna] with millstones or pound it in a mortar, [boil it in a pot, and make it into cakes].

What brought this upon them?  It was because they were not faithful ones.  Even here, \"the people were scattered around, collecting,\" they scattered with their own foolishness, and wanted to trouble themselves with, it was written, \"grinding between the millstones.\"  After all this trouble, it didn't come up into their hand, rather as it is written [in the same verse], \"its taste was a taste rich in oil.\"  And nothing else.

They would appear before Moshe for judgement.  He would say to them, how many people are in your household, and how many people in that household.  They would say, this many and this many.  At that time Moshe would say to them, gather [manna] tomorrow, and each of you will come before me.  On the morrow, they would go out and gather, and come before Moshe, presenting their vessels of manna before him so it could be measured.  If the servant belonged in that household, a measure of manna for them would be found in that household's vessel.  For there was one measure for each soul in the household.  Measure the other, and a deficiency would be found in the food for that servant, for there was one measure for each soul in the household.

This is the meaning of, \"and they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the girl, because he has brought out an evil name upon a virgin of Yisrael.\" Sages, this applies to after the wedding, since he says, \"I found not your daughter a virgin\" (Ibid. 17). Not all evil names are alike, since the spies who spread an evil name on the land were punished for it by dying and not meriting it. A woman is like ground, it is like the explanation that Esther was the ground.",
                "You may say that Esther has a bad reputation (by saying) that she was defiled with Ahasuerus, yet she was worthy that the Holy Spirit, (Malchut), would be clothed in her as written, \"Esther put on her royal apparel, מַלְכוּת\" (Esther 5:1). Yet the Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"I am Hashem, that is My name, and My glory will I not give to another, neither My praise to carved idols\" (Isaiah 42:8). The Holy Spirit is the Shechinah and is a name that was clothed with Esther. ",
                "Yet sages, woe to those who eat the chaff and ears of corn of the Torah, [<i>whose Torah is a mixture of good and bad, like wheat and chaff</i>]  Such a man knows nothing of the mysteries of the Torah, but only light/leniencies and weighty precepts/stringinces; the light is the chaff of the Torah, and the weighty precepts of the Torah are wheat, [<i> This is the secret of</i>] the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. [<i> The Sages said that this tree was wheat</i>]",
                "It is not the custom of the King and the Matron to ride a donkey (Heb. chamor), [<i>Meaning, the literal understanding of the Torah is referred to as Chomer, which is similar to Chamor, and is comprised of wheat and the tree of knowledge of good and evil</i>]. Instead they ride on horses. [<i>'Horses' here corresponds to the secrets and mysteries of the Torah</i>]. This is the meaning of, \"you ride upon your horses, your chariots of salvation\" (Habakuk 3:8). For Malchut is not treated lightly so as to have the Matron ride on a donkey, and even more so the King, for it is no place for commoners and servants, [<i>The angel Metatron is called a commoner and servant</i>] whose way is to ride a donkey. This is why it says of Messiah, \"humble (Heb. ani), "
            ],
            [
                "and riding upon an donkey\" (Zechariah 9:9). Ani stands for the Mishnah orders of Eruvin, Nidah and Yevamot, [<i>Ani also means \"poor\"</i>] and the rest of the Mishnah in total. [<i> As long as a person does not know the mysteries of the Torah, but only knows the revealed Torah, one is \"poor\" in knowledge and it is like he is \"riding on a donkey\", which is the aspect of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. However, Hashem</i>] is not considered a King until He rides on His horse, which is the Congregation of Yisrael [<i> This is Malchut/Kingship. See Song of Songs 1:9 \"I have likened you, my darling, To a mare in Pharaoh’s chariots\"</i>]. ",
                "The Holy One, blessed be He, outside His place is not a King. When He returns to His place, \"Hashem shall be King\" (Zechariah 14:9). It is said of Israel as well that all Israel are princes [<i>Literally, 'the sons of kings'</i>]. Like the father, so are the sons. The children are not princes until they return to the land of Israel. You may say that he is a commoner, though he is a commoner in relation to his Master, do not treat lightly a blessing from a commoner, for this commoner is the servant Metatron. The first man, who did not keep the glory he was given [<i> because he ate from the Tree when he was not supposed to do so</i>], was brought down to eat together with his donkey, and he said {to Hashem} 'I and my donkey shall eat from the same trough'. Issachar merited this donkey by being called, \"Issachar is a strong donkey\" (Genesis 49:14). ",
                "The sages who wrote the Mishnah {said that} it is said of the Matron, [<i>Matron corresponds to Malchut</i>], \"and His kingdom מַלְכוּתוֹ rules over all\" (Psalms 103:19), [<i> This is because she rules over the kelipot as well</i>]. After Esther put on {the royal apparel}, Esther ruled over Achashverosh and his people, and it is said of them, \"and slew of their foes\" (Esther 9:16). If you say that he {Achashverosh} mated with her, G-d forbid - though they were in the same house - {she did not mate with him}, but was like Joseph of whom it says, \"And she laid up his garment בִּגְדוֹ by her\" (Genesis 39:16). The word בִּגְדוֹ 'bigdo' is employed, which is derived from, \"traitors have dealt treacherously בָּגָדוּ\" (Isaiah 24:16). [<i> The 'beged' is the outer aspect, which the kelipot can attach themselves to</i>].",
                "There is a great mystery here, which is why 'Esther' is derived from mystery (Heb. seter), as written, \"You are my hiding place (Heb. seter)\" (Psalms 32:7), since the Shechinah hid her from Ahasuerus and gave him a female demon instead while she returned to Mordechai's arm(s). And Mordechai, who knew the explicit Name and the seventy tongues, did all this with wisdom. This is why the sages of the Mishnah stated that even regardless of this, a man must speak with his wife before he mates with her, because she might have been exchanged with a female demon. ",
                "This is true for a woman who comes from the aspect of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, but if she is from the Shechinah she remains unchanged. This is the meaning of, \"For I am Hashem, I do not change\" (Malachi 3:6). \"I\" is the Shechinah, who has no fear from the other sides [<i> i.e. the kelipot</i>]. This is the meaning of, \"All nations before Him are as nothing\" (Isaiah 40:17). ",
                "Wherever the Shechinah is, there are many special attributes {segulot}. Hence, since the Shechinah was clothed in her, Esther was worthy of having special things done to her like Sarah, whom the Holy One, blessed be He, kept, and since the Shechinah was with her He kept her from Pharaoh. The Holy One, blessed be He even made her clothes and jewels have special qualities due to the Shechinah that was with her. For that reason, when Pharaoh came {to touch} her sandal, {the angel} struck him with it, and the same happened with all her jewelry. Each jewel he would touch struck him until that defiled one left her and brought her back to her husband. ",
                "If regarding her jewels this was so, it is much more so that whoever touched her body, even her finger, for the purpose of mating, then, \"and the stranger that comes near shall be put to death\" (Numbers 1:51), since the Holy One, blessed be He, did not give him permission to come near her. This is the meaning of, \"I am Hashem, that is My name, and My glory will I not give to another\" (Isaiah 42:8). ",
                "For that reason not every {spreading of} an evil name is the same. The spies who defamed the land of Yisrael died. Those who speak ill of the Shechinah are most certainly struck in their souls, for those who spoke ill about the land were struck bodily and committed suicide. But whoever defames the Shechinah, his soul is stricken. This applies to whoever knows this secret and whose eyes are open. But a person whose eyes are shut is not punished as severely. ",
                "As for what the sages of the Mishnah said to them that a raped wife is permitted to remain with her husband, permission and prohibition in the Mishnah speaks only of human matters and a woman who is from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. But the case of a woman who is from the Tree of Life is not as that of those {from the aforementioned tree}, since whoever is from the Tree of Life is a righteous person with whom things are well. Of him it is said, \"No evil shall happen to the just\" (Proverbs 12:21), nor to his righteous wife. We learned that from Sarah in the house of Pharaoh that he had no permission to come near her. ",
                "Whoever is righteous but for whom things go badly, namely, he who is from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, since there is evil with him {at the moment}, \"For there is not a just man upon earth who...never sins\" (Ecclesiastes 7:20). As for an evil man for whom things go well, it is that the Evil Inclination overpowered his Good Inclination. Therefore they said that it is well with him, because the good is under the power {of the evil man}. And since the evil dominates the good, he is an evil man, since whoever is stronger receives the name. An evil man with whom things are evil is another El, who is Samael. It is evil with him, namely the poison of death, which is idol worshiping, {as it is said}, \"Evil shall slay the wicked\" (Psalms 34:22). For that reason a raped woman is considered so only if that soul has a mixture of good and evil. ",
                "When the Torah was given, her tablets that were likened to virginity were broken. And the Holy One, blessed be He, again gave her to Israel to keep her. And the oral Torah is called Halachah given to Moses on Sinai. And the groom of the Torah broke her virginity [<i>just like the first tablets were broken</i>]. Whoever speaks ill of her and says that Torah is not {the same as the original}, since her tablets were broken, the Holy One, blessed be He, will speak to him, who is the girl's father, that daughter who is {hinted at} in the word בְּרֵאשִׁית (In the beginning). [<i> בְּרֵאשִׁית is spelled with the same letters as 'Bat Roshi', the daughter of my head. The Torah is therefore</i>]the King's daughter. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke: \"And they shall spread the cloth\" (Deuteronomy 22:17), and the parchment of the Torah scroll unfolds, and they shall see that it is written in it, \"Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and I will write upon these tablets the words that were on ",

And {he} said {to the Ra'aya Mahemna}, 'Sinai, Sinai, it would have been worthy for us to listen to your words and be silent, yet with permission from the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Shechinah, I wish to say something to you, in your honor'. He said to him, 'speak'. ",
                "{Elijah} opened and said, 'Faithful Shepherd, the Holy One, blessed be He gave this bride of yours, [<i> this refers to Malchut/Kingship</i>] to Abraham to bring up for you. And since he kept her she is called his daughter. This is what is meant by the saying that Abraham had a daughter whose name was 'Bakol (Eng. 'in all')'. By her he observed the whole Torah even the Eruv Tavshilin (an action allowing one to cook on holiday for Shabbat). This is the meaning of, \"and kept My charge\" (Genesis 26:5). And he brought her up, as written, \"And he brought up Hadassa\" (Esther 2:7). And the Holy One, blessed be He, blessed him for her sake, as it is written, \"and Hashem had blessed Abraham in all things (בַּכֹּל)\" (Genesis 24:1). He brought her up with every good virtue and was charitable to her. He raised her to greatness, with the quality of kindness (Chesed) of Abraham. His house was, for her sake, wide open to do kindness to all the people of the world. ",
                "And because he was kind to her, when Abraham's children were exiled because of their many iniquities in Egypt, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'Faithful Shepherd, go and be kind to him who did kindness by you, since I gave him your bride, [<i>Malchut</i>], to raise with good qualities'. And he raised her {by the} thirteen attributes of mercy hinted at in the three words, Vav Hei Vav, Aleph Nun Yud, Vav Hei Vav, {וָה''וּ אֲנִ''י וָה''וּ} which are Vav, since the 72 names are comprehended in them the numerical value of Chesed/Kindness, with which Abraham overcame the 72 nations. Through your bride, he had a special segulah through the 72 names and he overcame every nation and tongue. ",
                "For that reason {it is written}, \"That caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses\" (Isaiah 63:12), [<i>This refers to Malchut</i>], and \"dividing the water\" (Ibid.) by tearing the water into twelve pieces, the numerical value of Vav Vav. And by merit of {the letter} Aleph [<i>the letter is found if you spell out the word Vav as Vav Aleph Vav</i>] You turned the sea into dry land. In it the Egyptians drowned, who did not believe in the Vav, [<i>This corresponds to Zeir Anpin</i>] which is {the value} one. In the future to come it will be fulfilled in Israel, the seed of Abraham, \"As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt I will show him marvelous things\" (Micah 7:15). In you it shall be fulfilled, \"That caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses, dividing the water\" of the Torah, to make yourself, \"an everlasting name\" (Isaiah 63:12). There you shall attain your bride. ",
                "Since this daughter [<i> i.e. Malchut</i>] was given to Israel, it is your Halachah from the left side, Halachah attributed to Moses from Sinai. For on the right side, your Halachah is the letter ה Hei, from the side of the name Abraham, Yud י from {the side of} Isaac. And everything is Hei Yud הֵ''י of {the name of} Elohim. And you are Vav וָא''ו, [<i> Moshe corresponds to Zeir Anpin, which corresponds to Vav</i>] which is the full spelling of {Malchut} and her perfection. {She is called} \"a full cup\". For at first she was the throne of Yud Hei, כֵּ''ס יָ''הּ. At the end it is a cup (Heb. כּוֹס) full of the blessing of Yud Hei Vav Hei.",
                "And since {Malchut} was given through you to Israel, who are the Central Pillar, it behooves us to reveal why it was given them. For surely we learned why she was given to Abraham, [<i> He drew down the attribute of Chesed, which is synonymous with Abraham</i>], and you were kind (bestowing Chesed) to his children just as he was kind to you. And the Holy One, blessed be He, gave her to Isaac, to him and his descendants to keep her from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. And they made her some boundaries and cut for her some garments, golden garments with some laws. And they used to disagree and ask questions regarding these laws, to supply them with explanations, to decorate her with many decorations for Shabbat and holidays, to redeem her at the last redemption, as it says of her, \"That (Heb. מַ''ה) which has been (Heb. שֶּׁ''הָיָה), it is (Heb. ה''וּא)\" (Ecclesiastes 1:9) (making the initials of Moses). (The rest is missing here).",
                "Since they brought it on you and did good things for you, you have suffered for their sakes many troubles so that Messiah the son of Joseph shall not be killed, of whom it says, \"the face of an ox on the left side\" (Ezekiel 1:10), who is a descendant of Joseph, of whom it says, \"The firstling of his herd, grandeur is his\" (Deuteronomy 33:17). That is because he and his descendants shall not be violated among the heathen nations because of the sin of Jeroboam who worshiped idols, for which he and his seed were to be violated among the idol worshiping nations. For Jeroboam the son of Nevat is a descendant of Joseph and it is because of him that it says of you, \"But he was wounded because of our transgressions and by his injury we are healed\" (Isaiah 53:5). ",
                "And since Israel are included of right and left, {i.e. the center}, where your Hei and Yud are in a state of completion, it behooves you to unite with her, {with Malchut}, between them. And since it says of you, \"because he has brought out an evil name upon a virgin of Yisrael,\" it says of you, \"and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days\" (Deuteronomy 22:19), {when} in exile he may not be away from her all his days. ",
                "Where is the evil name you brought upon her? After {Malchut} was given to Israel, whoever brings out an evil name on Israel is as one who brings out an evil name on {Malchut}. And the evil name was in what you said to the Holy One, blessed be He, \"Hashem, why does Your wrath burn against Your people\" (Exodus 32:11), and the Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'because you spoke ill on Israel when they made the golden calf'. \"Go, get you down; for your people have become corrupt\" (Ibid. 7), who are certainly the mixed multitudes whom you converted and who made the golden calf. And therefore, \"because he has brought out an evil name upon a virgin of Yisrael,\" \"she shall be his wife\".",
                "The Faithful Shepherd rose and kissed him {Elijah}, on his face and his eyes and blessed him. And he said to him, 'may you be blessed by the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Shechinah, by each of His attributes and His ten Sefirot and all His names and all the heads of Yeshivah and all the angels'. And they all answered and said Amen. And the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Shechinah acknowledged his blessing. Elijah, rise, open your mouth regarding the precepts with me, because you are my assistant in every aspect,  "
            ],
            [
                "for it first says of you, \"Pinchas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aaron the priest\" (Numbers 25:11). [<i>Pinchas is the aspect of Elijah</i>] Surely he is the son of Aaron, my nephew, as written, \"and a brother is born for adversity\" (Proverbs 17:17). ",
                "\"If a man find a girl that is a virgin, who is not betrothed\" (Deuteronomy 22:28). This precept is to punish the seducer with fifty shekels of silver. This is the meaning of, \"If a man find a girl that is a virgin, who is not betrothed\": these are Yisrael, who, from the aspect of the Shechinah are called daughter. \"and lay hold of her, and lie with her, and they be found; then the man that lay with her shall give to the girl's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he has humbled her, he may not put her away all his days\" (Ibid. 28-29). The sages and all the members of the Yeshivah said, \"a man\" refers to Yisrael from the aspect of the Holy One, blessed be He, [<i>who at times is referred to allegorically as a \"man\". Note, this is strictly an anthropomorphism and not literal</i>]; \"and lay hold of her\" with the knot of Tefilin, \"and lay hold of her\" with the Tzitzit. \"who is not betrothed,\" namely an only daughter, who is the soul. \"and lie with her,\" namely with the prayer of lying down, that is, 'הַשְׁכִּיבֵנוּ (Eng. 'cause us to lie down')'. \"shall give to the girl's father fifty shekels of silver,\" namely 25 {letters of the meditation of Shema} and 25 letters of the meditation {of Baruch Shem Kavod, etc.}",
                "Rise, Faithful Shepherd, for surely whoever studies Halachah [<i>Halacha corresponds to Malchut</i>], not for its own sake, and understands the Halachah, surely it is seized by him. Yet it has been explained that man should always study Torah even if not for its own sake, so that from studying not for its own sake it shall become for its own sake. And this Halachah is from the aspect of the good lad [<i>This refers to Metatron</i>] who separated from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which comprises the forbidden and the permissible, the unclean and the clean, the fit and the unfit. After, the lad is called a girl, נַעֲרָה, by whom it will be fulfilled, \"that the wicked might be shaken out of it, וְיִנָּעֲרוּ\" (Job 38:13). These are the forbidden, the unclean and unfit, Samael and his legions. ",
                "According to another explanation, \"If a man find a girl that is a virgin\" refers to Yisrael, as written, \"When Yisrael was a child, then I loved him\" (Hosea 11:1), {they are called Na'ar} lad from the aspect of Metatron, [<i>Their sould are from the world of Beriyah, and Metatron is found there</i>]. The 'man' is none other than the Holy One, blessed be He, as written, \"Hashem is a man of war\" (Exodus 15:3). \"If a man find a girl that is a virgin,\" namely the virgin of Yisrael, of whom it says, \"The virgin of Yisrael is fallen; she shall no more rise\" (Amos 5:2). \"Behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness\" (Hosea 2:16). Then He opened for them fifty gates of freedom, which are the fifty gates of mercy of the side of their father Abraham, [<i>Abraham is commonly associated with Chesed/Lovingkindess in the literature</i>]. This is what is meant by, \"shall give to the girl's father fifty shekels of silver,\" silver being of the level of Chesed, the levek of Abraham. ",
                "For at the exodus from Egypt, the fifty gates of freedom were opened to them from the side of Judgment, which is left, which is Adonai, אֲדֹנָי, [<i>This corresponds to Malchut of the left side</i>] where, \"will I judge\" (Genesis 15:14), [אֲדֹנָי contains the letters of the word judgment, which is din in Hebrew], for first I judge and then they shall come out. But at the last redemption {it is written about it}, \"with great mercies {will I gather you}\" (Isaiah 54:7), which is the grade of Abraham. And Greatness, גְדוּלָּה, [<i>which is Chesed</i>], is the grade of Abraham, since Binah there is {referred to as} the 'great hand', and there are fifty shekels of silver there [<i>These are the '50 Gates of Binah'</i>]. Later, \"he may not put her away\" into exile, \"all his days\" because \"she shall be his wife.\" This is like the words, \"And I will betroth you to Me forever\" (Hosea 2:21), and another verse, \"For your Maker is your husband. Hashem Tzva'ot is His name\" (Isaiah 54:5). \"You shall no more be termed forsaken\" (Isaiah 62:4). For even though the Shechinah is in exile, the Holy One, blessed be He, does not move from her. ",
                "The following precept is for one to marry the woman he violated. For surely there are two kinds of violated women - one who is violated because he loves her but she doesn't love him. Another is violated because she loves him but fears to mate with him without marriage and being blessed, or she doesn't want him if he is a commoner. Of him it says, \"and she shall be his wife\" (Deuteronomy 22:19). ",
                "In relation to mysteries of the Torah we have to employ an allegory. There is a soul that is the Matron, [<i>Drawn from Malchut of Atzilut</i>] and there is a soul that is a handmaid [<i>Drawn from the world of Beriyah</i>] such as in, \"And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant\" (Exodus 21:7). And there is a soul that is a common maid [<i>From the world of Asiyah</i>]. And so is man. There is a man who is a servant to the soul. Sometimes the soul goes by means of incarnation, [<i>Because of a sin in the previous incarnation</i>], \"the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot\" (Genesis 8:9), [<i>The soul is not at rest due to this previous sin</i>]. And the Evil Inclination chases it to enter that body, which is a maid to the Evil Inclination. It is a Jewish 'demon' and the soul is Yud {which is called} a Hebrew maidservant, in which this demon (Heb. שֵׁד) becomes Shadai, [<i>Shed plus the letter Yud</i>] because it kept the soul and repented through it, and with it blessed the Holy One, blessed be He, daily with 'Blessed (Heb. בָרוּך)', and with it sanctifies the Holy One, blessed be He, with 'Holy, holy, holy', and with it declares the unity of the Holy One, blessed be He, by Kriat Sh'ma.

Immediately there is fulfilled in it {i.e. the soul} \"and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days\" (Deuteronomy 22:19). But if he does not repent, {the soul} is enslaved in him through the iniquities he committed and it shall be fulfilled in him, \"the wife and her children shall be her master's\" (Exodus 21:4), [<i>meaning the soul will leave the person so his root</i>] and it says of the demon which is its debtor, \"and he shall go out by himself\" (Ibid.), [<i>Without a remedy</i>]. That demon is like Moses' staff that turns from a staff into a snake and from a snake into a staff. So does this demon turn from a demon into an angel and from an angel into a demon, according to man's deeds. ",

Of their daughters it says, \"Cursed be he that lies with any manner of beast\" (Deuteronomy 27:21). They hate Torah students, sages of the Mishnah, who are in truth like the ministering angels. For that reason the sages of the Mishnah explained about man that if he is as \"a messenger of Hashem Tzva'ot\" (Malachi 2:7), one should seek Torah out of his mouth.

When they arrive at the recitation of the Shema, her children call out with the 60 words of unity which are \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohenu Adonai Eḥad\". They go down to the mother and tie her to us.
